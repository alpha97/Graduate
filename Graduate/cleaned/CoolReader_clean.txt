The best ereader! I really love it. It is nice that you can customise just about everything you like! The only thing is, I wish you could synchronise your progress/bookmarks across all your devices. So I can read on my phone when I'm on the go and carry on on my tablet at home without manually entering the new spot. Would it be possible to do that at all? Perhaps with a log in. But otherwise this app is perfect! Always works well and a joy to use!
Needs cross-device synchronisation This is my favourite eBook reader. It does almost everything I need. The only thing it lacks is cross-device synchronisation to allow me to read from where I left off no matter which device (phone or pad) I pick up. Maybe having the app save its book position/mark index to Google drive (or any similar cloud provider) would do the trick. I'm awarding all five stars anyway, but would love to see a synch feature in a future update.
I loved the app and all features including the flexibility in layout. It supports all formats of e-books mentioned and there is also a night mode . Everything is FREE!! But it would be great if the page turning animation was made more realistic. That's the only thing lagging in Coolreader
Loved this app used it for years but got new phone LG g4 downloaded cool reader but it can't find my ext SD card now so can't read my books gutted this was best AP out there Help fix this problem please
Still many glitches Love this app especially the read aloud option can still read my ebooks while I'm multitasking. Always re-install when I change phones but the glitches seem to be getting worse. Forces close all the time even in read aloud mode and constantly loses the page that I was on when I close it.
Old but very good Highly customizable, every option you could want including advanced font settings, custom touch areas, titlebar with progress meter and/or battery % and clock. Bug with TTS where skipping backward results in voice skipping backward but highlight skipping forward.
Why ruin it? The app was working great! Now it won't even access my SD card. Why does every single developer mess up their product with so called "updates"?! I'd it works, leave it alone! Uninstalled...
Problem in Android Lollipop It used to be my favorite epub reader app. Back when I was still using Android Jelly Bean, it worked perfectly. But it doesn't seem to work in my new phone (with Android Lollipop). When I try to reduce the screen backlight brightness to the lowest level, the text becomes blurr. It was perfectly fine in my Android Jelly Bean though. So I wonder why it won't work in Lollipop? Can I just send this problem through email so i can show you the screenshoot? Please respond me ðŸ˜­
Keeps crashing This keeps closing while I'm reading i have to start over and skip pages to go where i left off its getting annoying. Im looking a different reader to use this is not for phones
WAS Best eReader period Since Marshmallow, doesn't use ext storage. won't even load from it. "trying to load book from non-standard location". my favourite app just bit the dust in a gory bloody mess.
Really like it but there is a rotation bug Works great and been using it for a while. The biggest problem I have had is the screen auto rotates in the app no matter what the global setting is. It's frustrating if you want to lay on your side and read as the screen turns 90 degrees. This is about the only app I have come across that ignores the global setting.
From phone to phone I've rarely had problems using this app. I love it actually. That is until recently. I am using Xiaomi Note 3, Global ROM, Android 6, Miui, 8.2. The app doesn't recognise the external MicroSim. When you have over 1GB of titles it kinds sucks cause it's taking up quite a chunk of space. Hope it gets fixed in the next update.
Excellent reader with many options I have been using this reader for many years, and it has always served me well. As another reviewer has mentioned however, it seems that in Android 6.0, files located on an external SD card cannot be opened by cool reader. I hope this is fixed in an update soon.
Can't see external SD card Love this app, but just got a new phone with Marshmallow and it can't see the SD card. I see reviews reporting this 6 months ago, so not hopeful this will be fixed. I guess it's the end of the road for me. :(
How difficult can be to implement SD card read access? I had this app on all my devices and now I just cannot use it with the book collection I keep on the card. Will come back with different rating once this is fixed.
Amazing! Allowed me to read many books in situations in which I couldn't have. Really practical and easy to use. Cool fact : you can quickly search words you don't understand in the dictionary, so it's perfect for reading in foreign languages!
Books disappears from recent books all the time. Annoying. Try it only if you do not mind to search for a book on storage, then search for a page you stopped reading at least once a day.
Would give it 5 stars, but... It crashes at random on my Galaxy s7 and my Galaxy Tab s2. Other than that of love the app. I've been using it for years now, and it may crash but it hasn't failed me yet.
Cut off sentences, but looked good. Unfortunately sentences, even those climactic ones at the end of chapters, were cut off from the second or third word; using another app showed the whole sentence, meaning that this app is faulty in some way. It's a pity, because I liked the look and feel of this app along with the slide screen brightness.
Great reader, but... On my Galaxy Tab A 6 it keeps on crashing. Very annoying while trying to read, especially having to find the page i was on. Needs an update.
THE ABSOLUTE BEST READING APP This app really rocks! It won't disappoint You, cool reader reads books when all other readers fail! UB reader failed to read something but this read it! It looks a bit bad but it works better than anything. I even somehow managed to download the messages off a social network and read THEM as a book! Beyond compare, you will love it, do rate it 5 stars!
The best ebook reader I've used in a long, long while. My only personal concern is that it tries to open the same ebook each time I start the app, not the one I'm currently reading. When I deleted the book, the startup message is "Cannot open book". Then I have to press Back & then click on the book I'm currently reading, from the list displayed. Apart from this one frustrating thing, I absolutely love it. If a solution can be provided, I'd have no hesitation in giving it 5 stars. Cheers!
Great ebook reader Can't say it's the best, just because after using it for several years on several devices I never wanted to try another app to compare, because this one has everything I need. It's good enough.
Very good reader, but force closes constantly Very good app, used to be my go-to ebook reader, but recently began to constantly force-close and lose track of the page of the book i'm currently reading. hope this would be fixed soon. meantime, i'm using a competing reader... Edit: using Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 and 5.0.2.
Perfect This is a great ebook reader on my old phone. It is very customizable. I use it to read html files offline as well as the more usual formats of epub and mobi with a few prc thrown in.
Until kitkat that was awesome app. Since marshmallow it's nearly useless The problem is with permissions, obviously. It won't even try to access my external SD card. Sad, because this is perfectly doable (some other ebook readers can do it)
Works well but looks disgusting Great app but it looks vile. Everything from the icon to the app background is revolting. I won't have it on my desktop as the icon is so dreadful. If the dev sorts out the aesthetics I'd give it 5 stars.
It has one major flaw. It can not read book files from the external micro SD card. Internal storage is no problem, but it won't even recognize that the SD card exists. Otherwise it is quite good for what it does.
Was one of the best, highly configurable. Perfect for those who don't care to spend a little time preparing it for the best reading experience. Unfortunately, since android 7 it doesn't work anymore, do not recognize SD cards and do not link itself with epub fies. Those faithful to it have no other choice to migrate.
Have been using this app for about 2 years now. Never had a problem till I got a new phone. Every time I exit the app, the font size and the brightness are set to default. Really annoying.
App is lagging while turning the page. My devices are HTC M8, which I changed to M9 and got the same problem. Please, optimize it.
This works well on my Samsung 4. I use it every day. It crashes once in awhile, but I have never lost any info. It's one of the few apps I've paid for - donated in this case.
Great application. But exists one negative feature. For Android 7 + miui 9 had no access to SD card at all. App shows notification that "application is old..."
Use Cool Reader 3 on my PC and have always loved it, but after installing this onto my Galaxy S7, and finding out it cannot read books from my SD card, I am going to have to abandon it and try something else... }:[
Cool Reader, formerly my ONLY, beloved eReader on both my Samsung Galaxy S 10.1 tablet & S7 cellphone, now sadly appears to be ABANDONEDware (the last update, v3.1.2-116, was on July 17, 2015). I'd still be gladly using Cool Reader (or Cool Reader GL) if it (they) had kept up with GOOGLE's DECISION (starting with Android v6/Marshmallow) to impose new security restrictions on non-native apps' [i.e., user installed] access to the external MicroSD card â€” where I have 1Gb+ of epub books). However, GOOGLE ALSO PROVIDED a workaround mechanism for non-native apps to REGAIN external MicroSD card access (via an in-app popup routine that requests the user to explicitly grant it that permission), & developers who cared about their users subsequently updated their apps accordingly. Alas, no such luck here & I've reluctantly moved on to FB Reader. Such a shame really to simply abandon millions of longtime, loyal, appreciative users without even a courtesy explanation &/or request for additional donations. ðŸ˜­ðŸ’”ðŸ˜­ðŸ’”ðŸ˜­
One problem Once you fix the screen rotation problem, it will be 5 stars. I've adjusted all the orientation settings and none of them lock it...
Can't delete files I've been using this reader for a long time and it's perfect for me. But since the last update I can't delete files directly from the app. Fix this, please?
It is absolutely slow and it keeps hanging. The pages don't even turn right. The font is bad. Who asked the app to change the layout of the book?
All time fav It was the second epub app I installed and it's absolutely perfect. It has a simple clean interface and highlights and bookmarks with ease,which are the features I look for.been using it on 3 different devices since past 2.5 yrs.so I've used it a lot and it has rarely failed me(no apps foolproof). Best app for epub files.
I love you! This is the best reader ever! Thank you! Ver Customizable, and that is the strength of this reader, makes me want to read more and more... Blissfully satisfied with this reader :) yup... and the tts is a luxurious option to continue reading even when you do something else but can't stop because the book is too exciting haha amazing, woo-hoo, enjoy books, enjoy life :)

Superb app which does exactly what it says on the tin. No fluff, just a simple tool which gives you your DoF and HFD based on your camera and lens data. I love how the app chooses the circle of confusion automatically based on the camera sensor. I also appreciate the tasteful graphic which depicts the DoF. What would make this app perfect for me: Include the option to work backwards, allowing the user to specify the minimum and maximum points to be in focus, and the app gives you the required subject distance!
Superb app I like to shoot from the hip on the street. My AF lenses get super confused about what subject to focus on. If there are multiple subjects, forget it. I've bought a couple of manual lenses and everything I want is in focus every time thanks to this app. Well laid out and easy to use. I'd happily pay for it if it wasn't free. Indispensable. Thank you :)
Although does not support any of my cams, I admire it for being pro grade and no ads. UI and performance deserves to become Top10. Canon 5D Mark IV , 6D Mark II , 77D & Panasonic GH5 are not yot added, I hope it will get listed soon so I can use it again...
Cool app with minor annoyances Easy to understand. No BS and doesn't overcomplicate the reading of the DOF information. The name of the app could confuse one to think that it only works for photographers that swears to using hyperfocal, which isn't the case it can be used by all photographers interested in using DOF in their photography. What sometimes annoys me is that the focal lengths are listed in increments of as low as 1 mm! That's good and fine for focal lengths below 100 mm. Above that increments of 10 mm should be sufficient.
I liked the app for it's simplicity and quick access to data. But would have preferred to have DoF unit as cm instead of feet or meters. Feet or meters for distance of subject is fine. But calculating DoF in decimal numbers of feet and meter becomes difficult on field.
Great app if you're working in digital work one camera and very few lens changes. If you're working with multiple cameras in different formats, the menus are bulky and counterproductive. Would love to see the addition of a camera and a lens pull down with editable fstop values specific to the shutter. Having 9000 Sonys to choose from does little but get in the way when I'm deciding between my 4x5 and my 6x9. Ideally I'd have a menu under the camera that had an editable short list of my 4 main cameras and a lens menu that allowed me to shift between my primes with one touch.
Great simple app. Easy to use. Works great with M43 sensors & lenses. A must have app for the street photographer who likes to pre set focus. Old school and charts still your thing? It's got those too.
This app seems very useful. My only criticism is that the screen is very difficult to read on a smartphone. It would help if the lines and text were bolder.
Wow! Includes Nikon D500 Stats This is so much more than I was expecting in a free app! As a n00b photographer who chose to jump in with the latest high end DSLR, it has already begun to help demystify the techical aspects involved in setting up and properly capturing a shot in a way that is easy to understand, with every aspect of the individual parameters tailored for my specific camera. Thank you so much for putting in all the necessary time and energy that it must have taken to create this app. May your efforts be properly rewarded!!
If you're new to Landscape Photography and would like to be able to understand and calculate your Hyperfocal Distance, then this app is for you! I'm 100% happy with this app and I recommend it to anyone out there who seeks to take better landscape photo. You can take my word on this üòâ
This is a beautiful app for photographers, it's so well made it becomes a game to play with and try out new configurations! Thanks for this, it couldn't be better. üëç
Great app, very user friendly, fantastic help to know your debt of field for all practical focal lengths and for all different subject distances. Field of view was helpful for me to figure out home studio dimensions. Many thanks for a great app
Very useful while on a field assignment to make sure I've got it right. I use it on my tablet and phone. I like being able to save profiles and emailing the tables.
Easy and useful Was a bit sceptical first, but a very well designed app indeed! Supports practically any camera/lens
Would be great if those small sensor like 1" sensor (g7x mkII etc), and others small sensor 1/1.7" (for g12, g15 etc) put on this list. Just put like the sensor size without needed to put the camera model. Because those cam have manual focus and sure need the help to calculate HFD
Database not up to date, A7R III missing.. Also the dof pic is static which is misdleading to get a feel of the dof as a visual.
Great app, let's see... ...if they react to my mail and will add the Fujifilm X100t. Then it's 6 stars ;). Thank you. Great little helper app. Clean design. Love it.
Like it...is it possible to delete camera profiles from the list? I just want to use this for 8x10, 4x5 and 5x7 cameras, there's a lot of digital cameras listed that I'd like to delete (to make it faster to find what I want)
Awesome Love this app. Handy in the field. Only feature I'd love to see is to enter desired dof and calc necessary fstop based on camera and distance
visually well designed and works great, actually helped me find the best aperture with one of my lenses too. well done to the devs!
Very useful resource What every tog needs, all there in an instant. Huge choice of cameras and focal lengths.
It's a simple and clean looking tool to get the basic number crunching without fuss... Simply select input parameters and it will give hyper focal distance.
I wouldn't be without this app now I have found it. For using the correct aperture for minimum depth of field required at different subject distances without loss of focus but maintaining bokeh.
good nice but when scrolling through the hfd table it would help if the aperture info remained fixed while only the data for the focal length scrolled, as it is the aperture disappears off the side of the screen and you lose all reference
It is useful apps for DOF calculating i used it and found it very helpful i hope to see canon 5 d mark iv in tue program Thanks a lot for you guys
Invaluable little app if you like to shoot any sort of candid street style photography, or shoot from the hip with a flash. f/8 & be there! 5‚≠ê
Clarifies and simplifies This app has helped bring several principles together in a clear and concise way. The tables are a bonus. Excellent job!
This app is like a good photo; its UI is sharp, attractive and well composed. Its subject is clear and informative. I even learned more about photography by using it.
The best tool I have come across on DOF related issue ,the best feature is the graphical representation/display of DOF, HFD, AOV and FOV makes grasping them easily.
Only drawback is that it doesn't contain video cameras (1/2", 2/3", super 35...)
If I was allowed to give more than five stars to just one app on Google play - this app would receive them. Simple, clear, provides complex information with visualisation, no adds. Other developers should learn from them. ----------------------------------- Please don't try to "improve" it with updates like others do, and often ruin the app by doing so. There is nothing to improve here.
The application‚Äãruns and works as advertised. I don't know what else I would have to say at the moment.
I keep it handy I am working on my street photography and this app is a big help since I am trying different camera and lens combinations.
Does everything I need it to really well. It would be helpful to have an option to focus at infinity though. If it had, I'd have given 5 stars
My lens is 600mm. HFPro only goes to 500mm. Scrolling down the list takes forever. The 'table view' only seems to go to 135mm! Where is 600mm?
[Es] precisa seg√∫n la f√≥rmula de la hiperfocal. Muy bien la usabilidad. Muy configurable. [En] accurate, following the hyperfocal formula. UX pretty good. Pretty much configurable
Wow! Nice presentation Exactly what I wanted in such an app. No BS, just great info one needs. Time will tell and if it's still feels like this in a month I will give 5 stars.
The best app for its purpose. Plenty of information presented intelligently and with ample clear explanations. All you need to know about depth of field.
Clean clear information and easy to enter parameters. Wishlist ....change font size. An optional larger one for tablet use would be good
Great Tool With many lenses these days not coming with a dof guide on the lens itself this is a mighty helpful app

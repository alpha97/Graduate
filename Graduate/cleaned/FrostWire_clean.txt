This app is completely useless. Doesn't even download anything at all anymore. Not music, movies, or even TV shows. Not to mention it doesn't even download stuff in the background. I literally need to have my phone screen time on the whole entire time while I download something, especially when it comes to something that's a big size. It's quite annoying and a complete waste of my time
I see there is yet another update. It. doesn't say anything about fixing the running in the background problem that I have reported. Will this issue be addressed or should I just go ahead and uninstall your app? A short reply to let me know if you'll be addressing my issue would be appreciated. Thank you. Posted 5/5: I used to really like this app but now not so much (and that's being generous). I used to be able to find most of what I was looking for but now I either get a limited amount of results or none at all. And if I do find what I'm looking for, it doesn't download. Another issue I have which started a few updates ago is that the app is running in the background. This is a big issue for me (and others I'm sure). It would be greatly appreciated if you could look into these issues and fix them. I would hate to have to uninstall after using this app for the last few years. Thank you in advance for your attention in these matters. Thank you.
Once you go through downloading a dozen versions of whatever movie you're looking, and you find one that's in the right language and will actually play then it's pretty cool, a lot of hassle to get to that point though
Crappy I had to delete every song sead it had an area playing
I love frostwire and the selection that it had mp4 for the best part and sometime mp3 and as long as you don't get the home made movies.
Super easy to use. I love how it works. You can play the songs you have downloaded even offline.
Too many covers and there's a lot of music I can't find.
Great way to download movies easy to use and many options and choices to make
Cant preview a song before downloading so it's a guessing game
A good app to get free songs on your phone.
Its amazing you can listen to music with no WIFI
First music downloader on any new device.. I love it...
Great for music on my phone for work!!
Good apps to look for favorite songs with the real singer... easily to download but to be careful for the unknown artist coz it might not be the original singer... that's the pros but cons is choose the right one coz there a lot of unknown artist who is doing copycat..
Not doing any of its primary functions. Songs you've downloaded disappear from your music player, search results are usually low and limited. you'll find more flac and mp4 files (which won't play on my phone) then mp3 files. I'm pretty sure this will slow down your phone. Also , most irritatingly, THINGS JUST AREN'T DOWNLOADING! This app is pointless now
Would of been a higher rating, but i recently ran into a problem where it doesnt download anything. It pulls the name of what i wanted in the downloads section, but it's just not downloading at all.
For the first few weeks, everything was perfect. I was able to download my songs with little space used. But after the update, it crashes as soon as I open it. What do?
Recently the app has been randomly opening on it's own and I don't know how to stop it. It's doing it all the time now. Wish someone would fix this issue. It even does it when I'm on data and not wifi.
To me, it does everything it says it does and then some it looks beyond allows you to look Beyond just the song it does other suggestion for you to be able to Surf thru or other songs you didn't know that artist had. watch out how much data is being downloaded overall. Far OUT Man!
Love it! A surprisingly thorough music app, & I am a music snob of sorts. Minimal ads, & extensive knowledge of the obscure music unavailable elsewhere. Worth the download.
Everytime I try to download anything it either will not download or when it's almost finished says error moving incomplete have plenty of space on my phone and strong internet tried many different sources to download but most of the time it will not start this app sucks sucks sucks
The only thing I would want added is an advanced search so you can look up by genre. Other than that great app.
Ok, so multiply the five stars by ten, you get 50 stars! I Have this app on all three of my phones! Its so great to use when editing YouTube videos, for example; Speedpaints(which i do alot of) it's so easy! And you can listen offline, as long as you have a song downloaded online
This is the best music app ever! I have been looking everywhere to find an app where I can download and play music offline! Definently recommend! Edit: I recently got a new phone and had to download some songs again but the songs I was looking for were gone! Please add Sabrina Carpenters album EVOLution and I will rate 5 stars.

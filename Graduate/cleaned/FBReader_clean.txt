There's an annoying bug that after switching apps and back, the last read page disappears, and even when turning pages it's skipped, so need to force close the app to fix this. Otherwise good app and will give 5 stars when this is fixed.
There is no rtl support.... I hate tha .... It should read right to left languages like arabic and persian.... Etc..... Otherwise its good reading app.
The most unobtrusive, and therefore the best, Android e-reading app I've yet come across. One small suggestion: tapping on a book in the library ought to open it at the last page read rather than taking you to the info screen, which you probably won't want to see more than once.
Apart from minor ui gripes (and they are due to modern phones lacking proper Back button), excellent. Afbee is nicest reader out there.
I think this is an amazing app, very simple to use. The only issue I find us the dictionary. I couldn't link my other app dictionary data to this. Developers has got this challenge.
Why can't I adjust the brightness like the waaaaaaaaaay older versions.... It's too bright even in night mode...
Has all of the things Kindle Reader lacks. I'm still using FBReader, on an HTC 10. Absolutely no problems at all.
So far the best Epub reader I've tried. It's not perfect, but I've yet to successfully find better, so props. I'm considering buying the pro version in a near future.
I hated this app, because I couldn't find any books I was looking for, such as Jacqueline Wilson and Jeff Kinney. All I could find were adult books. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this app to children.
Very good reader I have been using for years. Bought premium version just to support development, I am pretty happy with free version, though...
This is a truly great, highly customizable reader. Only question I have is why the night/day button disappears and reappears from landscape mode at certain times of the day? Revised: Thanks for fixing the glitch with the night/day button. Now it's visible all the time, regardless of screen orientation and time of day.
Was working okay. Suddenly it crashes frequently if I'm browsing or downloading in background. I use TTS plugin... suddenly it reverts to Bengali everytime it crashes or if I even open a different book. It is getting old!
Great and reliable eBook reader. Also the developers are very responsive and my last comments were addressed within a few days! Just keep the great work!
Bookshelf view is a paid feature
Bakwas chije bana rakhi hai........... Kam dhande kiya kre .....
Needs to fix tts position bug. Something to do with bookmarks or "return to..." causing the tts plugin to snap back to an earlier page. Very annoying when you're much further on in the book. Otherwise a great app.
The current free version won't open books from zip files. Paid version does. No warning about it and I think this is very deceptive and poor practice. I have used the app for years but will probably switch because I don't like authors that try to force you to pay by limiting key functionality
Meizu Pro 5. Not adequate behavior when reading in PDF format. If close and open program didn't start from place where I broke my reading, it starts from help. Have to browse my files, pick up file again and find place, where I broke reading, manually. Please fix because good reading app.
Sufficiently proven but not that generous in format and systems. Could be more advanced to stop keeping the user obliviously knocked into the installation. If the crew of the app could remove supportive adds it could mark detailed words in detective editors.
Fantastic app with all options I need. The only problem is with adding a dictionary. I have great dictionary and cannot use it wit FB, I hope the developers can fix this last missing bit on the way to the top reader ever.
I rarely write app reviews, mostly because I'm lazy and ungrateful. This app is so useful, that not writing a review made me feel so bad about not showing my appreciation that I had to break the loop and do it. Install, you won't be sorry. It really only does what it's supposed to do, and it's doing it very good. Thank you FBReader crew!
For some reason insists on ignoring the system screen brightness and managing its own. Now stuck in a dark unreadable setting and I can't figure out how to get it back to normal. Forget it.
Name checks out: definitely my FavoriteBookReader. This is the e-reader that spoiled my experience with all others. I have even gone to the trouble of sideloading it on my kindle fire tablet, because FBReader is so much better than the native kindle reader.
Don't be misled by the wide range of features it flaunts. It's not the best reader you'd want to download- 1. Doesn't auto detect relevant files downloaded from elsewhere. Either you use its library (which isn't all free) or open books from for manager for the first time. 2. UI is somewhat primitive-you can't see the contents in the handy slide menu. 3. It asks you to buy premium version for even basic features like bookshelf view. 4. Dictionary needs to be downloaded. 5. It's not ad-free!
I love the navigation system, very simple and efficient, I wish the PDF plugin didn't waste space on the already small screen, but for epub files, I don't think I could find any better
Excellent book reader. I've tried most of them, and this one is superior. Only complaint, I can seem to adjust the page margins, with or without CAR turned on.
Still a great app but please add continuous page way to change pages like how webpages are read in a browser. The book metaphor is nice for fiction, but not so much for technical books. Also if you can find a way to identify tables in a document and omit them when using TTS would be useful. Thanks for this great app. Still using after 5 years.
Page flips are not animated as page flips from a book, but as page flips from a presentation; ie: the screen is treated as an entire sheet of paper and not flipped in between the columns of text.
About as close to perfect as an app can get. Fully functional, beautiful, smooth, nothing useless or irritating or thoughtless.
долгое время пользовался на meizu 5pro ,не мог нарадоваться.после обновления прошивки на flyme 6.8.1.16 Android 7.0 перестал работать tts.
Does not like the extra pay to get book shelf view. If I can live without it, the reader is still ok.
Despite everything Google thinks it lacks, I still love this app. Best book reader app out there

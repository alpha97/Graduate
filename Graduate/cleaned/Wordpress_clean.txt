Latest update caused issues with Jetpack and multiple posts duplicated due to app errors. Uninstalled, this app needs less vanity updates and more rigorous testing.
Currently has poor performance (typing lags significantly behind your keypresses, and takes several seconds to show changes from predictive text) as soon as you try to edit a post of any reasonable length. Usable only for the most trivial of work on a blog - stick to the website for real work.
Shittiest application ..doesn't even match up to expectations even with an upgrade ..lags a lot and often restarts uselessly ...less modication tools on a free domain..app developers should honestly learn how to upgrade and make best out of limited resources.
A completely dysfunctional app that lacks direction or help files.
Its A great app to share your views and state your opinions
So easy to type a blog post from wherever you are!
Only useful if you do the most rudimentary tasks. On my first test, I ended up giving up and just logging directly into Wordpress Admin via a web browser. Photo uploads fail 50% of the time, and the message "generic error" is a useless for troubleshooting. Worse, the app is so basic you can't access all of your post settings. Very disappointing.
Good web interface. But the Android adaptation in the app is very bad. It's a great deal of difficulty to format the post. The formatting done in the post edit page is NOT retained when the post is published. Enters and paragraph breaks are ignored and all the content is published as if in one line. Paragraph indent is not consistently implemented. Only way to write a proper post is to use the web interface. That too, we have to write the whole post in the interface. Copying and pasting will again have same formatting errors.
It's a good all to easily update or create idea in post or page. Managing is a bit tricky so I firstly use it as app for the blog. I got a bug when modify the "heading" of sentence, the size become different, even for same heading, base on where you click, what was the size before, .. I need to load the page again to fix size
The app and the website don't work in sync with each other ! I've got posts deleted and modfied cause I saved a draft on the app, then finished the post on the website, and then re opened the app to find the blog rolled back to the draft. It is a huge pain to use the app this way. Would rather prefer a consistent website instead. Thanks, but no thanks !
I should be able to write in the app, not have it lead me to a web browser. Where the app then freezes. Very frustrating.
Overall, WordPress left me with a regret, that my time would have been better wasted had I gone for another CMS provider. The quality of the customer's experience is absolutely deplorable.
The biggest issue I have with this app is that when I try to write a draft on my phone and then press the sync button, it automatically publishes it to my blog and send it out to my subscribers. To me, that is not what the word sync means. Rather, I would have interpreted that to mean syncing my draft updates to match the draft updates that I have saved on line. If I want to publish something, I want to hit a publish button that is very clear about uploading the final product to the site. I don't want to be taken by surprise when a substandard draft is on display for everyone to read.
Previous version was more better after copies and paste very difficult to do some parts are in bold and some parts are in italics, editing problems in new version. Unable to upload files because no option available to upload files.
This app has one very annoying feature. If you start writing a post draft with it, the publish time for the post will be when the draft is first saved, and not when the post is actually posted. Let's say I start a draft today using the WordPress app. Then, a week from now, I finish up the draft, but now I'm writing in Firefox on my self-hosted WordPress instance. The "Publish on" shown on the post will be the date when the draft was first saved using the app, and not "Immediately", like it would have been if I'd created the draft in Firefox instead of the app. Long story short; the "Publish on" value should be "Immediately" unless something else is explicitly configured, regardless of if the draft was created in Firefox or using the app.
The app is great... But is sorely lacking in certain aspects, the most important one being that it has no private chat option. I run a blog with multiple contributers and communications regarding posts and other stuff are a real pain as they need to be organised off WordPress. So at least put in a chat option between site contributers if a built in chat option is too much to ask for.
Overall great experience having this mobile app to manage my content from anywhere. But Blbadly need a function to "SEARCH THE BLOG POSTS" Will re review the app to 5 star after this update. Keep it up the good work team;)
In As Much as i Loved the App for Updating My Blog, The Absence of Audio File Uploads Makes it Worth Nothing To Me. Kindly Work on it And it'll be 5star
Dear Developers, After the last update the app is being excluded from my recent app list. I am running on android 4.4.4 Kitkat. Hope you guys fix the problem soon.
It's all good but the only problem is while I try to select feature image, it doesn't work. I click on a particular image and it uploads a different one almost every time.
What a joke. No WSIWYG editing and the preview is also not showing what the post will actually look like. This app is totally useless.
This app is perfect but please I need to be able to search for posts; scrolling is not all that easy. Thanks
App is not good music bloggers can't use this app because you can not upload audio ...very bad
Doesn't have a "sign out" function. To achieve that, you'll need to uninstall and reinstall. Just an update on 4/28/18: Still requires uninstall and reinstall. Great stuff.
Its I think a good application for first time user to make website.
Keren bgt lah, cukup membantu buat yg suka nulis tp malas buka laptop..

ÂÜÖÂÆπ
Doesn‚Äôt open the app, just shows a black loading screen. I‚Äôve done everything from uninstalling both my phone and watch to rebooting both devices. Still nothing.
Ever since I was forced to update this app, I keep having to sign in every day when I want to use messenger! Please fix this problem!
Add black and white more colors like it‚Äôs so boring.
People are hacking this be careful
Nothing loads, the app doesn‚Äôt work. How can they push buggy code where the messages don‚Äôt even load and when they do the app hangs.
I always have problems to turn on and turn off on speaker
Just another worthless app that takes up space..they used to have it just on the app..a all-in-one..but I guess they think they are as big as apple or something..it‚Äôs going to be awesome when someone comes out with something better then Facebook!..just ask MySpace
Try to get messenger from Facebook.  Every time I try to go to the messenger from Facebook senting it throws me to the internet side. It‚Äôs strange 
Works great on my phone but on my watch it doesn‚Äôt load. I get the notifications on my watch but if I try to open the app I get a spinning wheel that never ends.
I find it very disturbing that I simply cannot figure out how to log out of this app. So every time I use it I have to delete it from my phone and then reinstall if I want. Shame on you again Facebook. Why do you insist on hijacking every aspect of our life and privacy. At least pretend to give us some options and allow us to log out or not give you all the details of all our contacts when we use your products.
I‚Äôve had to resort to looking up solutions on safari as to why my Messenger app on my Apple Watch isn‚Äôt working and I‚Äôve tried all of the workarounds and nothing works! Fix this and I‚Äôll change my review gladly. I use this app every hour of every day. I need it to work on my watch. Seriously. üôÑ What an oversight.
Not very good app it keeps closing on it own. Please fix
I have tried deleting and re-downloading messenger. I simply can‚Äôt get any of my messages on the app.
Crashes constantly for no reason..l
I lost an entire conversation without explanation.  No archive, no backup, nothing. Lost 2months of conversation. Of course app keeps IMs from 2009, but not most recent one from earlier today!
This app is terrible! and sooo federal
Add an option to hide My Days feature
Games on Facebook massage are very annoying please add setting to able to disable it
It is not enough? We already have too many ads on Facebook and now we have to see huge ads on messenger?
Bring back the active toggle...  After researching why I didn‚Äôt have it anymore, I found unlimited people complaining about the lack of the toggle...   Quit taking away the good stuff, before I take you away.
This makes me mad how they basically copied I messages but instead of staying out of your business they look through your personal texts like when I talk about something an advertisement will come up in Facebook later that day.
Where is the archive? ü§¨
When I send a pic or video it sends it smaller than what it should be and it‚Äôs really irritating. Please fix this ASAP
I have the iPhone 5s and it doesn‚Äôt give me the option to use chat heads. It‚Äôs rather inconvenient to have to open in app and exit another.
Facebook‚Äôs messaging system should be usable without the need of downloading a second system. People should be granted the easy access, and freed memory space, of having everything in one place.
Should all be on one app not separate
Please make this work again. I‚Äôve tried everything. It just spins around
Thanks fb.
The app has always had its problems, but it‚Äôs been especially slow and problematic lately. Calls fail to connect, the app crashes during calls, and the phone is slowed down to a halt often. The volume issue is still present as well.
I hate Facebook, the ONLY reason I downloaded this garbage app is because I was forced to DL it to simply read a message from someone important. Doesn‚Äôt even deserve one star
Just plain got sick of it. Spoof messages from Friends that got hacked. Don‚Äôt need it. I think I see it in that cloud over there!
Games are all glitchy, do not save when you close the app, randomly slow, will freeze and make u restart. I get that‚Äôs not priority one, but if you are going to do it, do it right.
So far I have found nothing to like about this. Hopefully it will get better
I‚Äôm so sorry for the bad review. Just loaded back into messenger and the pics showed up.
Even when I had my iPhone 6S Plus it was glitchy. Please fix this issue!
Does not work on my Apple Watch I have everything updated and messenger will not stop loading! Tried everything.
When I first started using Facebook messenger it worked fine but now when I message my Facebook friends they don‚Äôt get my messages because they aren‚Äôt going through even though it says delivered on my end. Just like the other day me and a Facebook friend were messaging each other and BAM all of a sudden they stop receiving my messages because now they aren‚Äôt going through which has happened with several Facebook friends, but sometimes it works perfectly when talking to other Facebook friends but it seems to only send messages to whoever it feels like sending them to. I have even deleted and reinstalled the app multiple times but it‚Äôs still the same so I‚Äôm about ready to just delete Facebook messenger and not worry with it anymore because why use something that doesn‚Äôt work half of the time.
Stop stating under ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs new‚Äù that it is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù!  List the changes, so when you do remove useful features (and you DO!) we can choose to NOT ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù 
Messenger keeps locking up alm night and all day. Powered off phone and closed out the cash but still keeps locking up. Can‚Äôt find anyone to contact
You may need to update the app it's crashing when I was looking through filters messages
This app is awesome for being a free app. Just a quick question. What happened to the media? There used to be a function that allowed users to see all the pictures shared with others by opening the chat and clicking on their name. Is that not working on iPhone anymore or is it just me...?
What's up?  My iOS version updates SEAMLESSLY & is now iOS v. 11.2.6, but I now have 266 apps WAITING with 30.91GB of available capacity on my 128GB Apple iPhone 6s.  What's up? 
Why on earth do you have to modify your garbage app after every two days? It‚Äôs so annoying üòñ In the recent update we can‚Äôt see the time i of a call i just dropped. 
Very disappointing
I don't like being one of those people, but I literally find it impossible that this app has a 4 1/2 star review- based off of almost 200,000 reviews?! What the hell?  This app doesn't even get remotely close to that quality.  Beyond bizarre. 
Fix your app!!! It used to be fine, but now the speaker button is so buggy! It turns off by itself randomly and I have to hang up and re dial someone sometimes more than 3 times to get the speaker to work. The volume isn‚Äôt adjustable half the time, and stays either really loud or really quiet. Fix it!
Connects me with friends and helps remind me of hw by talking with my friends and can be fun to talk here and there.
Once you sign in you can never sign out. The only option is to switch accounts. The deactivate messenger has been completely removed. So what's you're sign on to messenger. You're in forever.
I can understand ads added to facebook app, but on messenger?? Really ?? The sould purpose of messenger is to chat and talk with people , and all i can see now is buch of add within the list of people. If rating below 1 star wqs possibe i woud have give it
It Would Be Highly Appreciated If Someone Could Fix The Problem With The Voice Notes. My Friends Said That Theirs Don‚Äôt Send, And If I Hold The Mic Icon For Too Long, It Will Freeze My Screen And Won‚Äôt Send. Y‚Äôall Gotta Do Something About This üíØ
You guys never fix anything, I can‚Äôt unlock people who are already unblocked
Honestly, this has been a known problem for YEARS!  Why is this still not fixed?  I‚Äôm seriously considering just deleting the app now because it f‚Äôs with my OCD. I get mad every time I open the app. I‚Äôve tried everything suggested in the forums and it still shows up. FIX IT!
This app is awesome, don't change a thingüòÉüíï
All I want is to turn it off so no one even has the option to message me. That‚Äôs not what I use Facebook for and the notifications are just irritating.
It‚Äôs so annoying when i get a new message from someone as soon as i click on the app it immediately opens the message! I don‚Äôt want that bc then the person sees that I‚Äôve seen it and maybe i didn‚Äôt want to open the message right away!
The app is excellent. but I guess it could be better with less size. Even the Facebook app it‚Äôs size a lot I think.
App works great on my phone. But it‚Äôs getting old that it never loads on my watch.
You miss the entire point!  Read all please.  I give messenger a resounding ZERO stars.  Ok every one is complaining about volume controls, this or that and others complaining about the people complaining.   Here is the deal folks I used messenger and the Facebook apps.  I never had issue with the way either operates. Messenger is spyware!  That‚Äôs right when you load messenger you give permission for the app to read not just messenger messages but also your text.  You give permission for messenger to listen to, record your voice and video even when messenger or your phone is turned off!  So perverts at Facebook, messenger, the FBI, CIA can be looking at and video recording your children naked or you having sex with your partner and it‚Äôs completely legal because you agree to it.  Messenger is a blatant violation of privacy that forces you to accept when loading the app.  Most people do not read the fine print of any app they download and the rights you do willingly give away to use it. So if your cool with people spying on you 24/7  by all means use messenger.  Otherwise you can join me, delete messenger and if enough of us do this it will force Facebook / messenger to change the way they do business.   Ignorance is bliss.  The government / corporations will always do what you willingly allow. 
Because you guy are keeping asking me how was the call with one review is fine lol and plus us iPhone people can‚Äôt view Facebook while on video messanger
I use this app constantly - more than iMessage and Snapchat - to communicate with my closest friends. I‚Äôve never been a fan of the Stories that have been introduced and it can get in the way when I‚Äôm trying to go to one section but it takes me to the camera to add a story (why is that button there on the bottom?). Nevertheless, I know Facebook is trying to get a bigger audience so it resolved to trying to be like Snapchat.  My main complaint is trying to see old sent images. I go into my friend‚Äôs chat tab but the images are NEVER loaded. What‚Äôs up with that? I think it has to do with the new update.   New profile pictures are hardly updated either.  I will continue to use this app because it is my main form of communication, but these little things have irritated me to the point where I felt the need to review. 
I abhor getting notices from Game Center‚Äôs. My granddaughter likes playing the games. But in the middle of the night I get FB notifications from Game Center ... do I want to play a gameüò°. NO. I don‚Äôt
I do not want you share my phone and email contacts with facebook. Now that I've installed the app on my iPhone 8 plus it's not letting me use the app unless I agree.  No thanks.
I love the App and love connecting with friends and family but I do think the thing that needs to change is the you are now connected with messages, I think they need to be in a different area and not in with all the other messages. It‚Äôs hard to keep track of new messages when they get pushed down to the bottom cause of the now you are connected with messages.
I‚Äôve used messenger a long time & loved it but your annoying ads & now the fact that they use all my information (& have access to all my data, my camera in my phone etc etc) I‚Äôve had to delete it (shame about all the messages I‚Äôm getting from actual ‚Äúfriends‚Äù will now go u answered...) Shane on you Facebook messenger 
All of my messages older than two weeks have disappeared since the update on the iPhone 6
Don‚Äôt send me an notification asking me to turn on my notifications. I obviously went out of my way to turn those off.
Why the hell am I getting adds after each move when I play word with friends? That‚Äôs annoying, PLEASE fix
Messenger is still a stupid and ridiculous app that is just another scheme for Facebook to make money.
On iPhone 8 Plus it keeps crashing whenever I open it and I got a lot of friends on here that I need to text please fix this thank you!!
I don't want pink on my phone. Change it facebook, or I will leave. The messages being pink is so annoying it is terrible to use the app in public. Hey, look at that guy's pink bubbles on his phone. Change it now or give me an option to change it.
I use messenger for a lot of my communication. I have been mostly unable to use it for the last two days. I have tried deleting it and reinstalling. I have tried updating my iPhone. Sometimes it works for a moment but there‚Äôs no rhyme or reason. I have a constant loading screen totally blank and unresponsive. I wish there was at least a fall back like using it in browser. I tried to use the help desk, but it wasn‚Äôt helpful at all. I can‚Äôt seem to find a place to report my issue, so here it is.   Otherwise I like messenger decently, as it is easy to find and contact people I wouldn‚Äôt have in my phone contacts. Video and voice messaging is useful and the filters are fun... All of this- when it works! 
Why the hell out of nowhere are you saying tenor isn‚Äôt a safe link, and you block it for me. I didn‚Äôt ask you to do that, plus it an extension of your app, which if you don‚Äôt fix I‚Äôll be deleting. Please fix this!
Keep getting an error signing in. Nothing but a blank page after signing in
.
thanks for forcing me to download this spamware trash
Where are all of the photos sent to people in messenger?!?! I have years worth and now they have all disappeared when you click on their name.  Used to be able to scroll through them, not anymore....
Nice feature but I had to delete mine because a hacker hyjacked it.
Not all shared content is good.  Provide the capability and instructions on how to delete shared content in Messenger. 
9 times out of ten when I open the app it says connecting but will never connect. So 99% of the time I can‚Äôt use it! And this has been going on for over a year now. You would think by now they would have fixed this issue especially with how they claim to ‚Äúupdate the app regularly‚Äù currently have a message but can‚Äôt see it or who it‚Äôs from because it won‚Äôt connect. Worst thing they ever did was make the messages a separate app!!!
Messenger app doesnt load in apple watch properly please update and fix the issue and remove the bug. Cant use messenger in my apple watch, I just bought my new watch and I am disappointed.  Please update your app, please fix the issue!!!!! 
Stole my friends info, put another person I never knew or saw before in her place and messaged me! PLEASE do something about this! I only use it because of FB and am seriously thinking about deleting this app and FB permanently.
This Facebook Messenger has problems with Messenger Bots. It needs to be updated.
Please stop asking me every time I log in to import my contacts  I don‚Äôt want people to be able to find me like that and it would be great if I could say no and be done with it instead of trying to hold me hostage til I say yes 
It‚Äôs become a giant emoji teenage fest that you can‚Äôt even write a bloody message without hitting some kind of cutesy thing.  It‚Äôs become Facebook lite. It‚Äôs just supposed to be for messages, but it‚Äôs a bloody scrapbook moment.
yes i like that because it good sound of send emojis games also now for easy to left last sude there is bar of games.interesting who created these games messenjer or somone else but anyway if there will be alis cery funny games like inflation belly inflation about women feeding to be fat training to gym to have muscles ballon inflations to fly around or something.  and other face cameras wgere you can get diferwnt faces i want to be there alsow from facebook if facebook and messenjer are tovether then it would be of corse faces the last newest movies form my little pony justice league clash royal and other 
CANT GO ON MESSENGER W/ OUT OTHER PEOPLE FINDING OUT ABOUT IT!!PEOPLE YOU DIDNT WANT TALK TO CAN SEE U ONLINE AND HOW LONG UVE BEEN ONLINE!!!!GIVE US THE OFFLINE STATUS OPTION SO WE CAN ONLY TALK TO THE PEOPLE THAT WE WANT TO TALK TO!!!!
Attaching files that aren't pictures is a real bother, as is  multiple images at times. Other than that, the app is great! I'd love to be able to use my pencil on it,but that's just an extra feature for me. But then again,so are the mini games üôÉ
Needs a translator built-in  most of the time but I do not hear the notification sound and   Now the app seems unstable open it up and it closes immediately Not working on my I phone or iPad  Very unstable Needs improvement 
There is no way to see you‚Äôre message requests anymore. I know I had some and now they are gone. That‚Äôs annoying. It wasn‚Äôt broken. Stop trying to fix it
I noticed that when I finished an audio call using messenger, I lost the sound on my earphones, so every time I have to restart my device to get the sound working! So I need help with this! And also if someone else had this problem before !
Spam videos being sent via FB messenger using profile pic üò°
Use to love this app so much , but now it keeps crashing and it won‚Äôt let me send pictures at all !!! Than when I‚Äôm on FaceTime with someone it only lets me FaceTime them for like 3 mins and than it shuts off all by itself and than the app won‚Äôt open .
The application needs to be fixed. It will not load on the Apple Watch.  All it does it gets stuck on the loading screen.
Love the app. Hate that it just loads and loads on my Apple Watch. Plz fix this bug! I would like to use the app on my watch
I can send gifs, but when one is sent to me, I can‚Äôt view it. Any ideas?
ü§î
What happened to othello in the games list??
I don‚Äôt like this messenger app.  It a tool that the hackers use and it should not be connected to Facebook.
My keyboard keeps freezing but when i type my other messages it work and now it‚Äôs saying i got two messages but nothing is popping up
I used to rely on being able to go to my conversations, click on one, and then click on the persons name to see the pictures sent between us but now that‚Äôs gone and it‚Äôs ridiculous to think I have go scroll through hundreds of messages just to see ONE picture! This needs to be fixed also the volume of calling on both Apple and Android is just horrible. It‚Äôs never ever loud enough, maybe create some sort of stabilization for that? I don‚Äôt want to uninstall the app because I use it so much but it needs to be fixed IMMEDIATELY!! Others I know have commented that this is a problem but yet it isn‚Äôt being fixed, maybe Apple likes it when people give their apps a bad rating
for this app has worthless SECURITY. I‚Äôve had a notification badge app on in FB messenger for going on a month. It bothers me. And  where are the instructions for this app? Idh it except for the version in FB... where can u find the date of something appearing in your interests column. Important information if you think u clicked on something not right. Click on your app support & it takes me to FB WORTHLESS help. I‚Äôve been hacked inside & out, starting with them. I thought you two got divorced?? Where then is your support??
I was looking for the deactivation options but I see nothing. Which I wanted to deactivate my messenger or if you cannot add that up, please add separate  logout from messenger. Bcoz I do want totally logout if not in use.... Please add logout options that May satisfies all users. Thanks!
Slow cumbersome annoying
PLEASE GET RID OF THE GREEN DOT UPDATE. I love the ease of use of this app and use it often (I prefer it to texting even) but personally do not want it advertised to my stalker when I am online. The green dot being made so much more prominent on the app has actually prevented me from using it at times to avoid him from see that I am online. The green dot has to go. Or at least make it optional to turn on!
It‚Äôs idiotic that I can‚Äôt message on Facebook without the app. It‚Äôs online... why can‚Äôt I just login on safari? Some people don‚Äôt want the apps on their phones.
My games refuse to load and I‚Äôve sent a report and nothing is fixed. Please fix it
Would really like to be able to go back and view all the pictures, recipes, memes and what not I‚Äôve shared with people instead of only being able to go back so far.
stop emojifying my smileys you dorks!
Hola espero y puedan leer mi mensaje quiero saber si pueden mejorar esta app de messenger para que no todo el tiempo est√© abierta y se pueda tener m√°s privacidad y que se puede abrir y cerrar cesi√≥n as√≠ como en Facebook que pones tu contrase√±a y puedes entrar y salir sin problemas esto ayudar√° a tener m√°s privacidad y en caso de que alguien pierda su tel√©fono nadie pueda leer sus conversaciones espero puedan mejorar este punto y sobre todo espero que alguien pueda leer esta sugerencia muchas gracias...
Can‚Äôt use, totally inoperable as it won‚Äôt finish the install.
Before I had to uninstall/reinstall for the first time in a few years since I had this app on my iPhone due to frequent freezing/crashing, I‚Äôve never really had any issues with the permissions and I was able to access all of my photos within the app so I wouldn‚Äôt have to share the photos I want through my albums app. Now the ‚Äúaccess photos‚Äù permissions don‚Äôt even come up into my phone settings since that first uninstall/reinstall process, but the camera, microphone, backup data, cellular data, siri, and anything else that Messenger needs comes up, but not the photos permissions. Please fix this
Stop sending notifications that look like you have a message waiting that say the most ridiculous things like ‚Äúyou are now connected on messenger‚Äù that is obvious since we just connected. It‚Äôs a complete waste of time a total distraction from real messages and the reason I deleted the app from my phone.
Messenger automatically adds people when you ‚Äúfriend‚Äù them. They are still on the list if I friended. You can't block or delete their message or profile. Looks like I‚Äôll delete Messenger just to stop their messages.
I do not like the way to go about deleting old or unwanted messages on Messenger.  It causes you to accidentally open a message even if you don‚Äôt intend to. I wish it was still where you slide to the side to delete or or have an edit tab to highlight those you desire to remove.  What‚Äôs there now is not user friendly at all.  Makes me want to remove app.
Stopped working after the 15 th update. Tried to uninstalled but now will not reinstall. Any suggestions ? After a few days it reinstalled worked for a few now back to one vertical line of random letters with an arrow that does nothing. So frustrating. 
Am√©liorer les appels stp
Now they‚Äôre in messenger too? I hate you guys so much.
App just randomly froze couldn‚Äôt read or reply to anything. Had to delete and re download
This app is rejecting some of my video clips, Needs dire technical fixing of some issues!!
I‚Äôm old, dumb, and have an iPhone. I can‚Äôt find a place to get ‚Äúeasy‚Äù help. I love some of the features and would like to do more with it but can‚Äôt find help. I even checked the website but no luck. You change features so often some of us dummies need info.
Still to this day annoying asf i have to download a whole other app to see my messages it would be wayy quicker for my messages to be used in facebook rather than forcing a whole other app to open one of many reasons I don‚Äôt use facebook anymore
You get banned on Facebook for a BS unfair reason, Messenger bans you too.  So don‚Äôt rely on it.    And now it comes with ads.  Eat a bag of D**** Messenger, Zuck, and the Microsoft CEO.  BTW, where did all the MS Viruses go now that Christian Bill Gates has been muscled our out of HIS company? Curious isn‚Äôt it? 
Where is my teardrop on messenger video chat?
The Apple Watch app works but desperately needs to be optimized. IF it loads, it takes a looooong time to load.   Also, it‚Äôd be nice to have an Apple Watch complication. 
I can not access the settings for this app or log out of this app. This is very inconvenient and it makes me feel as if I can not control what is already mine.
Will not work I‚Äôve tried everything stays stuck on black screen with loading wheel
Bloated and slow this app has a lot of crap I don't use. Messenger is a constant drain on battery and uses far more data thanks it should.
I‚Äôve recently received FB messages from 3 FB friends who were hacked and I don‚Äôt know how to delete these messages so I just keep deleting the app. Please make it intuitive to be able to delete a message without deleting the friend.
I love this app. I work my business on fb so it's great for communication. Love that on the desktop I can click "unread" and it'll only show the messages I haven't read yet. Would be great to have on the app as well! :)
I love the app but please do something with these Hackers!
I like üëç it.
Attempted to do the update few days ago. Update still not complete 
I love using messenger for calls, group video chats and group messages with friends. Audio quality is a lot better than a real phone call. It‚Äôs also the best I‚Äôve found for chatting with >2 people at once.  When I do audio calling though, I frequently have trouble with toggling on the speakerphone option- it‚Äôll turn white like it‚Äôs on, but no noise comes out of my speakers. It‚Äôll also spontaneously go from speaker to ear only without me touching it. If that wrinkle got fixed, I would be super happy! 
I do like the app.   However, I wish conversations and people could be deleted easier!
I tired of Facebook and their intrusiveness. Deleting Messenger now.
This has to be the stupidest marketing ploy I have ever seen. Why do I have to download an additional app on my phone, just to stay connected. This should be done through the normal app... Facebook just wants to have ‚Äúmultiple apps‚Äù and increase its ‚Äúdownloaded‚Äù numbers. Quit trying to be thieves and just combine the two...
Its crashes when I reached to messenger it brings back to home screen. Worth rating will be Zero this time from my side.
Now my chat is mixing business and please. Very difficult chat interface without a sorting. Also always notification that chat photo changed is unnecessary.
Can‚Äôt download
Here‚Äôs a one star review for harassing me with pop ups to update. If you want to force people to update then make it so that old versions don‚Äôt work. Don‚Äôt harass me with pop ups. Also could everyone please abandon this white supremacist social network? I only have to have this garbage because it‚Äôs the only way to contact certain people I know. Seriously let the white nationalist have this trash if Facebook isn‚Äôt going to be proactive in stifling hate speech.
I have downloaded this app I don't know how many times and it still doesn't work. You need to get rid of it all together!!!
Every time my friends change their profile pictures, the messenger app doesn't seem to update it.
It‚Äôs not working to FaceTime on a group
Please fix it!
Why should I have to download an app to see a notification that I am now connected to a new Facebook friend? It is so annoying to have to navigate between apps for Facebook and Messenger. It is also misleading and difficult to ensure that you don‚Äôt receive notifications from this useless application. The app itself works fine I suppose but it is annoying and useless to have to download at all.
The app has too many prompts to turn the notifications on. Every time you go to the app, it prompts to turn them on. So irritating. I just install it when there is a message and then uninstall it. That too because facebook failed to create mobile web site for it.
Bring back the pulsating video icon when on the screen as the user you‚Äôre talking to. Thank you!
But I just started noticing ads have been placed within the app. That‚Äôs an instant uninstall for me. Now the interface is even more cluttered than before. Get rid of the ads and I‚Äôd probably install it again.
This app is amazing to chat with & FaceTime with people üíñüíñüíñ
I have downloaded the app over and over hoping that would solve the issue. But it will not even open. Just stays stuck on the loading circle. There is no way to report the issue that I can find!!!
I swear to god, every single time this app is updated they create new problems just to update two days later and fix them, then rinse and repeat. I absolutely hate it. It‚Äôs one bug after another!! It doesn‚Äôt take a developing genius to test a version before you release it - yet they release updates and then have bugs pop up all over the place when they easily could have tested first.  I got to the point where I bought service for my cell because I couldn‚Äôt stand the constant issues and needed a reliable form of communication.  When it works it‚Äôs a great app, but it‚Äôs currently not refreshing to tell me conversations are unread, crashing, not loading past the first loaded names, and will freeze consistently. 
I am getting an error message from the market place when I use the message keys
The app is great when it works. That‚Äôs not very often lately. Lately I can‚Äôt get it to connect and when I do, it cuts out constantly. I know the problem isn‚Äôt on my end because I even tried it on my iPad Pro. It did it on my iPhone and iPad.
For the love of god, please stop notifying me that I can now message someone who I just became friends with. That became obvious when I became their friend. Also, many times these are people who I would never message in a million years and I don‚Äôt need to be reminded of that!
I‚Äôm getting messages from 2010 can you fix it?
i want to use facebook just from my divice and my id only  someone else using my id  plz remive all developers 
The app works fine, but if you roll w/ notifications off (as I do), they‚Äôll ask you to turn them on every time you open it up.  Take the hint FB!  I don‚Äôt want notifications! 
At one point messenger asked if I wanted to sync my phone contacts with messenger, which I didn‚Äôt. Now it just does it on its own without any permission, adding a bunch of people to my messenger who‚Äôs phone number is in my phone contacts but I DO NOT WANT TO BE CONNECTED TO ON FACEBOOK OR MESSENGER. There is no way to delete them. So I‚Äôm deleting your app.
Why can‚Äôt you just log off messenger?  Was using on someone else‚Äôs device and had to delete app to get off the app on that device. That‚Äôs bs!!!  Needs to be fixed to be able to just log off!!!
Every time I click on the app on the watch it shows the loading symbol. Please fix it !!
I have gotten strange messages from my friends this week.  Very odd messages and I‚Äôm assuming that they have been hacked through messenger.  I aren‚Äôt seen any security features in this app and have had to go back to Facebook to change my password, which I‚Äôve had to do twice.   It that doesn‚Äôt seem to help protect me from getting messages from others that have been hacked.  Facebook touts security but I don‚Äôt see it here.
Garbage forces update of buggy privacy identity stealing app. Can't use old version.
I can view any of my pictures in my conversations it‚Äôs just blank and I really New this to be fixed
Please bring back messenger emojis for iOS!!
Everything is perfect
The app won‚Äôt even open for me, just a loading messages screen then it goes black and closes. Wasn‚Äôt like this till the most recent update. Please fix.
I miss the presence bubble when the other user was on . Please fix that .
Please fix this bug, I cannot see who views my stories. The viewfinder button is gone.
There is nothing wrong with this app. It works great and all ways have.
I swear this app is the worst one out there. I have been in a group call multiple times and I have kept trying and trying but nothing seems to work. No one can hear me. I‚Äôve even updated the app to its most recent update and this is still the worst app ever. You say you come out with updates regularly to fix bugs and improve it yet you still can‚Äôt seem to fix the issue where almost no one in the group call can be heard. Your updates do NOTHING what so ever.
Uninstalled the app on iPad. Former version was better with the log out or sign out option. While multiple users have the option to switch accounts, it‚Äôs not good for security and privacy reasons especially since I need to let others use my device to read work info or presentations on a group setting weekly and the iPad is passed around. Wouldn‚Äôt want them to sneak a read on my social media messages while at it. Plus our boss randomly checks if we‚Äôre online on fb messenger, assuming that if we are online, we are not working. I‚Äôd appreciate it if developers can consider returning the sign out option for the iPad at least.
Please fix the Apple Watch app!
None of the messenger extensions work. I have tried every gif extension and they do not load/search. Please fix ASAP
I don‚Äôt want a second app just to check my inbox
The last update made my messenger janky. It take forever to load new messages in existing conversations, it crashes constantly, and is overall subpar.
I‚Äôve tried literally everything a user can try to get this app to simply LOAD. It won‚Äôt. I wish I could give it zero stars.   I‚Äôve turned off my Watch & powered it back up. Closed the app & re-opened it. Disconnected & reconnected Bluetooth. Uninstalled and re-installed. Reset my entire Watch.  I‚Äôve also done all those steps for my iPhone, as well as doing both steps simultaneously on both devices.  AND I‚Äôve tried the ‚ÄúChange your default replies‚Äù trick.  This app is genuinely, truly, 100% UNUSABLE on the Apple Watch.  If a developer reads this, what I see is ‚ÄúMessenger‚Äù in blue @ top left, the time in white @ top right and an infinitely spinning buffer circle in the center.   Yes, I will get notifications of messages in notifications, but clicking that will take me to the screen mentioned above.   Any and all help is much appreciated. 
Just put the messenger back in the FB app. This app is terrible. Stop cluttering up our phones with garbage apps.
The Messenger app functions, and that‚Äôs about all I can say to support it.  Update notes are useless. They are not descriptive at all, saying only that they are always ‚Äúimproving‚Äù the app without informing end users of anything. The recent ads are annoying. The app tries to force certain things (like going through your contacts to find them on FB/Messenger). The suggested stickers are irritating. There is such a thing as ‚Äútoo much,‚Äù and right now Messenger is trying to do too much. 
I am sick sick sick to death of having messenger and I get hacked ! Update your security ! Then I end up with someone on my friends list I don‚Äôt even know ! Fix it I refuse to use it until you do !
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MESSENGER HAVE A CONTROL BUTTON NOT GO GET TAGGED IN CHAIN LETTERS ETC ITS GETTING ANNOYING PLEASE FIX THAT SO WE CAN See ANY TAGS IN MESSENGER THANK YOU And tired of virus 
I‚Äôve had my Apple Watch for 2 years now, when I first bought it I was Apple to access my messenger app but since September I haven‚Äôt been able to open the app at all. What‚Äôs strange is I‚Äôm able to receive messages on my watch and respond but I cannot open the app to start one. My wife is having the same issue with her New Apple Watch I bought her less than a week ago for her birthday. Hopefully something can be done about this I have co workers with this same issue also.
My account has been hacked several times. Now my ‚ÄúMessenger‚Äù account was hacked - sending my friends bogus stories about getting money if they only respond. Signing my name and picture!!!
Facebook is trash, this extra needed App is trash.
My messenger was hacked and sent out a bunch of spam. Not I am blocked from sending messages. Can somebody please fix this? I don‚Äôt see a place to send a message.
Why can‚Äôt I see last active?
Unable to view my fb messages from app . Can this be fixed
Creo que deber√≠a de arreglas todos ya que hicieron un s√≥lo de sorden
I had just updated, not wanting to in the first place. But as soon as I did it won't even let me sign into the app same being as the actual Facebook app. I find this completely ridiculous and frustrating please fix ASAP!
I prefer the old way of turning off availability.  I also do not like all of these people who are ‚Äúsuggested‚Äù.  Is there a way to go back to the previous version?
I cannot close my phone without hanging up the call that I am currently in. This used to never happen, but apparently now if I press the lock screen button it also hangs up the call. Why? Please try to fix this, it is a really big inconvenience. All it does is drain my batter because the screen is in constant use.
Add mobile site compatibility back into your site.
And every time I download the messenger I have to end up deleting it because it to make the phone run horrible and in itself The messenger it runs horrible
I just want to be able to delete annoying messages that people mass send, without opening them!
Your application makes my iphone restart sometimes and that upests me, its is a seriously bug
I hate I have to use this useless app just to remove the red flag that confirms your friendship with someone. It‚Äôs a waste of space and another thing I have to check off.
Everything is so complicated . It needs to be just messages and basic stuff like video chats . All the extra effect and filters are just junk taking up space
When I call anyone, the call won‚Äôt go to speaker. I have to reset the app several times (2-3 times) and it will finally work. Another issue is if I cut off the screen, the call is ended. So I have to sit and let it waste battery to finally turn off on its own. Yes, I‚Äôm aware I can set the time to be shorter but I prefer not to have to tap my screen every 5 seconds when I‚Äôm using it for schoolwork or reference.
Lol best app in the world I can hang out with my friends on ground chats
Me encanta esta app por aqu√≠ puedo hablar con mis amigos y conocer m√°s gente y Germ√°n garmendia me dijo que lo hiciera
Please just stop asking me to turn on notifications. It's really annoying.
Lately messenger is flooded with spam and virus causing memes. There should be an option to allow you to not only turn messenger off INDEFINITELY. It was literally the worst move to make FB and Messenger two separate applications. USER BEWARE
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòò
My account got hacked. It sent out to all my contacts a video of me that had several thousand views so people would open it but nothing happened there was nothing there. So I deleted my account. Now what? I‚Äôm afraid to start a new one.
Keeps booting me out!
This app keeps crashing my iPhone 6 n causing it to restart wat can be the cause for this I‚Äôm running the lates update for the app
Too many hacks coming in by way of Messenger. So if I delete the app and then get a notification that I‚Äôve gotten a message from someone who has the app, I want the ‚ÄúLeave‚Äù button to ALSO delete the enumerated indicator in my fb app screen. AND give the folks who are using Messenger some kind of return notification that a friend/user is not using Messenger at the time they send it.
Can you please fix the problem with how the app crashes every time I open it and as well as during face time the call stop a lot even if the connection has good signal
En android aparecen las burbuja de chat aqui no las tienen. Esa era una de mis principales atracciones
Can you guys make this app more secure please this app gets hacked to easy
It seems the watch version of messenger just spins and spins and only seems to work when I get a text or call from someone else. Can you please fix this?
Why am I not able to be private in Messenger? When I turn off the Active switch, I am still able to be seen from others people‚Äôs devices as online (I‚Äôve checked) why is there no true privacy or discretion for those who do not choose to be available to others 24/7!?

All of the sudden my past messages are unviewable I‚Äôm tired of it! I can‚Äôt locate anything!
It‚Äôs a good app a little laggy but the worst thing about it is the volume it‚Äôs so low .
App is not wanting to open. It jus freezes. Any idea why?
When I first got my watch messenger had no issues and as time went on I can‚Äôt even get it to load now, just black screen with spinning wheel it‚Äôs annoying
Will not update again unless you state specifically what you are updating. STOP UPDATING FOR NO REASON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Since last upgrade  one on messenger can't sent tenor gif will load but won't send please fix I use to use daily. Thank you. Now since last upgrade will not connect to internet even though all other internet users alright has writing under all gifs to upgrade to newest just did that when last come out always update right away but after now messages won't connect BUT ISN'T EVEN LISTED UNDER SETTINGS ANYMORE PLEASE FIX I HAVE LOT OF LONG DISTANCE MESSAGES I NEED TO GET THROUGH
The Messenger ad for sending Money has locked up all messages in my phone.
Ppl accounts are being hacked into. This problem need to be fixed asap!!! Ppl are deleting their messenger acct.
I am not able to hide my active status on Messenger since I switched to iPhone. This is a deal breaker for me, such that I won't message anyone on Messenger anymore.
Need a way to ‚Äúselect all‚Äù to delete messages!
I downloaded the app and hit the button to continue as me and then it glitches and won't let me go any farther. I need this app as it is the only way I can get in touch with some people. Hopefully this will be fixed in the next update, but for now I can't even use this app on my iPad.
The app spasses out and goes to installing or loading and cannot be used for days at a time
How can Facebook Messenger use up 3x as much data as Whatsapp when I use Whatsapp 100x more intensely than Facebook Messenger???
Facebook is ripping off snapchat
The latest update has resulted in the app just crashing on me while I'm mid-sentence typing to someone, and this is after lagging endlessly as I try to type! The very essence of a messenger app is IT ALLOWS ME TO SEND MESSAGES. COME ON.
This app is hella thirsty for all your messages so it can mine them for data.  When you add a new friend on Facebook it sends you a notification that you can now chat on messenger, which is super dumb and a waste of a little bubble.
I can‚Äôt oppen messenger please help
every time i try to call someone it sometimes says call failed it will ring the person will pick up and then says call failed it gets so annoying because i have to delete messenger re download it sometimes it works and i dont have problems and sometimes it dont and says call failed it wud be awesome if this problem never showed
Please fix video viewing to original. When I click on a video it‚Äôs shows next and comments I want to be able to click up and down to see videos. I don‚Äôt get to see any live videos anymore
I cannot stand Facebook and rarely use it, but when I do I use the mobile website. Why can‚Äôt I just view my messages there instead of using an app to do it?
It won‚Äôt let me sign in it won‚Äôt send the activation code to my phone number it says I‚Äôm someone else and I really won‚Äôt this app
The only recent update added interactive ads in my list of conversations. I use ad blockers on all my PCs and refuse to use any site that says i need to turn it off. Now, i‚Äôll refuse to use this app because of the ads. Wasn‚Äôt a great app to begin with, this is just the tipping point.
I do like the app for the purpose of staying connected to friends. However when the new update happened, I‚Äôm no longer to be able to delete old messages???
There is 1 change FB has made n kept that not only is it not an advance but a hindrance! We could at one time text friends who don‚Äôt use FB or their messenger they had another messenger to use that comes with your phone however for whatever reason FB removed the option. Why? I haven‚Äôt been able to convince 1 person to download FB messenger so if thats what they were hoping for I don‚Äôt know if it worked considering my experience . it has made it more work for me if I want to share something I liked so please consider putting it back. Sharing something great, informative or beautiful just might be the trick u need to convince some to use FB messenger.
The old messenger embedded inside Facebook was easier. Messenger takes up too much memory! Don‚Äôt like it
Just got an Apple Watch I was excited to use the messenger app, however when ever I try to open it, it will stay buffering for a long time and never open the app. Very disappointing. Hope it gets fixed soon.
The app keeps freezing and crashing, stopping suddenly for no reason. Closing the app, refreshing, and even deleting and re-downloading don‚Äôt seem to do anything.
My friends are so dumb and I‚Äôd really like to be able to react with ü§î
Have to dl this to just to read a message.
Enjoying the app.
Can you please fix this. I can not see the times of the calls I am making with in a single message. Didn‚Äôt seem to be a problem before.   Thank you 
I can't open the app when i open it it automatically exits it. It's been happening for the past 1 week.
Love Love Love. Great way to keep in touch with your friends or NIT!!
For some reason messages, videos, links, and photos that are sent by me or from my friend don't show up in the app but it still notifies me that something was sent... I thought it was my wifi but my other apps work perfectly... it's been a bit annoying cause I have to wait to go back home and open my computer to open up the message on Facebook itself... hopefully you'll be able to fix it soon... thank you
Can you fix it so we can delete multiple messages  at one time instead of just one at a time???
Okay, so I just got this app and I am absolutely loving it. It‚Äôs basically now the only way I communicate with people through the messenger app. I also love the text tone when someone texts you. I recommend you tell your friends to get this application. Another cool feature that the Facebook messenger app has is that it lets you call for free. For example, my cousins live in Copenhagen Denmark. And if I want to call them, I just dial there number and it connects me to them and the quality is superb. 5 stars for messenger! Way to go! üòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÇüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòä
Is it really necessary to ask what, 6 times, if I want to turn on my notifications?! And is the Facebook app just not complex enough to have messenger on it? It has to be 2 separate apps? Plus the calling through messenger is a pain. I keep the app deleted just to avoid this.
I have noticed that when I am calling someone through the app the scream always goes black and the call keeps on ending. It‚Äôs annoying when your talking to something and you can‚Äôt see them cuz the scream is back and turns on when it wants to.      **********PLEASE HELP *********** 
When ever I get on a call with a friend my voice is delayed whenever I talk and sometimes my voice isn‚Äôt coming up at all. Even when I scream into my phone but it‚Äôs still not working. Please fix this problem cause I love this app but not when it‚Äôs not letting me do things.
I‚Äôd like the control to log out of my apps, please and thanks.
I keep getting messages from people that I don‚Äôt communicate with regularly. They say is this you ? With and emoji.  I‚Äôm sure they are some kind of virus and haven‚Äôt opened any of them, but I was getting them everyday and I finally deleted the app.
I‚Äôve already deleted the message request everyday for 2 weeks. But it keeps popping up like it‚Äôs still there but when I click on it it takes me to the message requests page and nothing is there to delete. Please fix this it‚Äôs annoying.
My phone is a perfectly working iPhone 6+, 128GB, so no, my phone is not full or none of those things are the reason why this app crashes. I can play big games on my phone perfectly well, the only app that crashes is messenger. It‚Äôs been crashing for over 6 hours now. I haven‚Äôt been able to check any of my messages for the past 6 hours because you guys decided I needed this separate app to chat. So yeah, right now this app feels like the most useless app ever. It‚Äôs like, I press messenger, the app launches, then suddenly screen goes black, and app crashes without letting me even see who messaged me. I have deleted and reinstalled the app to see if it works but nope, it does not. Neither does turning my phone off and on. The app still crashes.  I would have rated 0/5 if it was possible. 
Every single time I use the app it asks me... if I go out and come back in it asks me...  I don‚Äôt want notifications on now or ever. It‚Äôs way over the top how often it asks. 
I cannot find any User Guides or help. App is very confusing and don‚Äôt know how to clean up App
Really, Facebook?? Ads???
Constant freezes and crashes. Not having this problem with my Android app. What a waste of time! Not having a problem until lasted update.   Back to the drawing board boys. 
Messenger App Store
Can‚Äôt get the app to work on my watch
My phone stopped every freaking time when I go to messages.
Can‚Äôt load it all  week :/
This is how I communicate with most of my family around the Country. We all love it. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I just purchased the new Apple Watch 3, and every app works except for the Messenger app. All it does is give a loading circle that never actually loads. Can you please fix this bug? 2 stars because this has been a reported problem since last year.
because you separated the messenger from the facebook app  @fritzfutermann 
So I‚Äôll be playing the the game and I‚Äôll get the points to level up but for a couple of days my avatar or whatever you call it is still on 9th place of blonze 2 and even when I finish a song and get points it doesn‚Äôt move it‚Äôs still 715 of 715 and I‚Äôve tried to shut down my phone delete and redownload it but nothing works ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
How do you delete old messages.  Can not find it any where in the app.  If people are messaging you to hack then I want to be able to delete it.
The discussing comments about VP Pence will now keep millions from watching ABC! Your loss.üëéüèª 
I really love this app! It's so helpful to connect with friends or family who aren't living near you! Thank you Facebook!
Please add a way to delete shared photos in a conversation. Even after I delete entire conversation, photos still remain in shared content.  Also, the volume control during video calls could use a major update. 
Please add call duration when finish a call....
I can‚Äôt send voice to my group chat  But i can send voice to my friend Plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz fixxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 
They fixed the iOS 11 issue and after an uninstall/reinstall it worked again. The app now seems fine. Still wish I didn't need a separate app for messenger but what can I do?
Speaker button is not working  Power button ends calls which is so annoying  The app crashes a lot  The calls connections is so bad I don‚Äôt understand what is happening to the messenger app!!!! 
App is junk. Liberal based app developers need their heads examined.
The only thing i hate is that when im on the call sometimes if i press the power button to put my phone to sleep... it ends the call... this is very stupid as in when im on the phone with my girl i am usually playing the game and when im done i like to put my phone to sleep but i cant because the app decides to turn off.... fix it pleaseüò≠
You Know What Would Be Cool , If The Nicknames Showed Up When People Callü§™‚ô•Ô∏è
Unless you deal with the issues I posted above, I will not upload messenger. Please fix it.
This app says its compatible with all iPads running iOS 8.0 or higher. I have an iPad 3 (yes an old iPad, but again, it states all iPads that run in iOS 8.0 n higher) I am on iOS 9.3.2.
Brand new watch. This app won‚Äôt even load on the Apple Watch. Garbage.
This app doesn‚Äôt work on the Apple Watch which is a bummer! It‚Äôs known that I‚Äôm not the only one with this problem. The messages won‚Äôt load. Please fix!
Still shuts off & can't zoom a pic? MAKE A OPTION TO SHUT OFF SPELL CHECK.IM SO FED UP WITH IT TWISTING MY SPELLINGS,!!!
Having to get a separate app to view messages is stupid!!
Horrible update.  The people tab is a big mess now.  Can‚Äôt turn on and off when it shows online.  Terrible.
This new update is stupid. I can't see all of my previous conversations. Many of them disappear that I need and I can't have that. The only way they will reappear is if you install a previous version of the app. Please fix!
I started a group message to plan an even and half the people aren‚Äôt even seeing the message on their messenger
I want my privacy back - 100% anonymity! I‚Äôm tired of having to give FB permission to use my mic or camera (even when I‚Äôm not using the app) just so I can communicate with family and friends through the app. Until then, you‚Äôre deleted and I will take as many users as I can with me.
Really annoying that this has been an issue for 2 years now with messenger not loading on the Apple Watch. The workaround only fixes it for a few days and doesn‚Äôt even work most of the time.
Don‚Äôt force me to download
Never had an issue before until 2 updates ago.keeps reconnecting and lags
In this version, there's a fault while switching accounts from one to another. It's shown unknown error/ session expired and I can't login again with any other account. Finally uninstalled and reinst
I can‚Äôt tell you how aggravating it is to hear from my contacts every couple of weeks that they think I‚Äôm on FB 24/7.  They think this because of this lousy app.    I‚Äôm not impressed at all with that or the features that aren‚Äôt included.   This is a mess. 
Brand new iPhone 8. Suddenly messenger force closes when I open it making me unable to message anyone.
Hi ! Good as it is too heavy! Better to make it lesser !
They should really fix the option that shows how long has someone been online it‚Äôs never right. It‚Äôs causing a lot of problems with people thinking you‚Äôre not getting back to them. They should just delete it,  horrible feature get it right Facebook.
After suddenly getting an infinite spinning wheel on my Apple Watch when trying to use Messenger, I googled and found many people with the same problem. I did everything on the Apple end to try to reset, update, repair, etc, but they assure me this is an app related issue. The app is useless to me on this device. Please update with a fix!
This is superb.
Apple Watch app not working
I have an iPhone, and I was saddened when it came out that the special Messenger Emojis were canceled on Apple devices. Can't you have a setting to disable them? Because I prefer those emojis over the Apple ones and I use Messenger most so I was very happy about the emojis. But they disappeared completely for Apple products and that really upset me.
The app doesn‚Äôt work on my Iwatch even just updated. Was excited to see the update and still doesn‚Äôt work.
Totally spies on you no joke just creepy as heck
I can‚Äôt see what I‚Äôm typing & have to keep turning my device every which way to confirm what I think I have entered. Think update needs to be retracted or corrected quickly. Worst ever
I just want to message but the phone restars again and again. :((
Loading wheel keeps spinning for hours in Apple Watch . Fix it
I Would like to se What time And how long was las call please as older versions  Thanks 
It‚Äôs a communication app designed for people to communicate. Nobody needs the extra commercial advertisements or another tracking mechanisms built into the spyware. Every updated as a step backwards and privacy, most people don‚Äôt get that.
My conversation w/ people are all automatically deleted and I don't know how it got all deleted. That's some bs
The new update is stupid!!! Cant see the time of calls and its annoying!!! Need to see time on calls n duration please!!!
Every time the app updates, I know... because it stops working. My phone ‚Äúbings‚Äù to tell me I got a message. I can read it, but I can‚Äôt respond until I update the app first. If I‚Äôm somewhere with a bad signal or no wifi, then I can‚Äôt reply.  Stupid. 
Since I've updated this app it keeps crashing and cannot reload or delete from my iPad. It just sits on my screen as a black square. Works fine on my iPhone. Grrrrrrr.
With the latest update, the time stamp for calls disappeared. Please bring it back. Also, I used to be able to skip the ‚Äúplease rate the quality of your call‚Äù screen and now the stars just sit there in the middle of my conversation until I rate the call. I liked having a choice on whether I want to rate the call or not.
One of the reasons why I liked messenger a lot was because I got play games with my friends. Now, I can‚Äôt even play with them not even by myself because there‚Äôs always an error, please fix it
My messenger has been hacked. I closed the login on Facebook and changed passwords twice but people are still receiving messages. I can‚Äôt seem to figure out how to fix it. I have deleted the app as well.
This app will not open at all in my Apple Watch.
Is now the new snapchat.
So annoying doesn‚Äôt work for anyone
Messenger provides a wonderful way to connect to your family friends or business associates. I have have found some great moments of relief from a stressful day here. Thank you. üòä
I have done absolutely everything I can think of and I also looked it up, but this app gives me a notification for only a couple messages I receive the rest are silent and don‚Äôt vibrate or even make a sound when phone is on loud. Also switching between two profiles makes the app go white screen and will not go past that I have to delete the app and then redownload it and start the process all over again and still no notification sound!! Please fix Asap!!
Very useful tool
Why should i see advertising in messenger !!!
Hi, when i opened messenger on my iphone 6 plus its  hanged and restart automatically... only this problen when i opened fb messenger...
Now this is very fantastic and working even not in good mobile connection. I think there should be changing with a small new features to user for more happy experience. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Member Bangladesh Awamei  League
Huge download  Extra app for a core Facebook function Developers who are too incompetent to describe what they changed  When will you stop this failure?  Seriously 
It never installs, then idiots gripe about our issues they do not have and so mind your own business and stay out of mine, your only aggravating a failed app that never works.  So time to remove 5 fake stars for fake app. 
Please update this.
Keep it up but you have to stop this saying add only people you know. That is not good, because you can add any one you like
I‚Äôve updated both the IOS system in my phone and the Messenger app itself, but now every time I click on the app it doesn‚Äôt even load. It just automatically exits out. Can this bug please resolved, because I love the app. I have friends and family that live out of state or travel a lot and I communicate with them through messenger.
I think that messenger is a great app, but Siri compatibility would expand the app's abilities‚Ä¶
ok i‚Äôm the type of person who hates when people crap all over social media and how it‚Äôs addicting/infesting our lives. but lol the fact that you absolutely must download this app to see any facebook messages on my phone is ridiculous. i do not need two apps for this üò≠ also i don‚Äôt like notifications on the facebook app, i never check them anyways, however every time i open the app there‚Äôs 4 notifications all telling me to turn on notifications
You should bring the cry filter back. It was my favorite....... and now.... its gone...... I'm very sad.
Separating messages into their own app was one of the dumbest idea Facebook ever had. Every time I want to read a message I need to download the messenger and switch back and forth between Facebook app and messenger... not sure what benefits this separation has brought the end user.
You can fix my password it does not matter what I put into my phone you never accept let my password go I would like to get into stuff on my phone do not use a password
Well first off let me start by saying that it‚Äôs completely ridiculous that you need a separate app to use messenger...secondly the photo loading take absolutely too long I uploaded a video that was a combo of slow motion and normal speed it literally took a full day to upload a 30sec slow motion/normal motion video. No editing no filters nothing 3rd the filters they have made for this facebook app is it amazing.... when it finally loads up and gets added to your photo or video...lastly the security system that is put in this place I agree stealing music is completely wrong and to claim it is yours is wrong but when you are simply uploading and video of some one playing in a band the security system takes it off the same goes for using apps that allows you to use the already added music on that app and it is watermarked with the apps insignia...these useless updates to make it faster is recommend true but also is the security and video and photo quality and time it takes to upload a simple 30 to a 1min video is absolutely appalling that is also with high speed data and high speed internet..please fix these problems and I assure you ppl WILL. Use Facebook more. But what am I saying I‚Äôm only a simple user of the app and noticed all and every bug since Facebook was launched.
See for yourself. Don‚Äôt turn on notifications.
Interface has options to deal with/Block/Mute/Spam/and deleting conversations, but Messenger is not allowing this to occur, same spam/hack, same remove/delete, same people/hack are back when App is used. I call that a fail, Messenger has been removed! Get a clue or step aside, your pick.  Sincerely,  Formerly a user. :(

Messenger has drifted far afield from being a chat venue.  It is cluttered with extra features that distract from original purpose of being able to talk privately.
The quality of the filters are not that good. I end up saving my Snapchat and sending them on messenger for those of my friends who still don‚Äôt have Snapchat
Now it gives me the option to rate calls, great. But I wanna see what time I made the calls, and you guys took that away.
Updated app and can no longer open it also disappeared from screen.
Chucki villegas
Stop with the ads and anybody shouldn‚Äôt be able to video chat
Wrote this review so it‚Äôd stop asking me to review it
It works good when it dose not lock up
Provide better privacy
No need to download game apps.. messenger app has games built into it!! Love love love it!!!
Wow just a pacesetter, or changer in the apps industry!!!
I can‚Äôt get gifs and forces you to get app to see messages.
I want to work for Facebook!!
Just when you think it can't get any worse, they somehow manage to do it. This awful application is now interferring with my native phone and text messenger in iOS. I removed it, but reinstalled just to write this. Uninstalling permanently after I finish this.
Like ..thx alot
It‚Äôs good and fast so no problems
Beautiful to find all my friend
I love how messenger doesn‚Äôt stop the sharing of nude pictures.
Contacting family and friends here is so easy. I have stayed in contact in written and video format with everyone. Thank you FB Messenger.
I love messenger.
It‚Äôs fun and easy
The microphone button that has to be depressed to record and send audio messages is very difficult to use. I was wondering is there any chance of bringing back the big red button? Oh and maybe a feature so you don‚Äôt have to push down on the button the entire time while recording a audio message would be very cool.
I love how it does not give you the times that the message was sent or read.
Idk what it is exactly but can you guys fix the camera. Sometimes when I‚Äôm on a video with multiple ppl, it‚Äôll get stuck and won‚Äôt rotate, my camera will go out and then i can tap any of the functions on my screen. I have to completely close the application an go back in.
Why I can‚Äôt make myself unavailable from chat and why I can‚Äôt hide my self from my friends when I want. So I deleted the msgr App
Every time I enter the app it asks me if I want to turn on notifications; does FB think everyone is dim and can‚Äôt make decisions about this aspect the first 5 times it asks? Using fb is a novelty that allows the sale of advertising and the mining of personal data... keep it up and: delete...delete...delete
Messenger gets hacked easily.
The Best App Ever ‚ù§Ô∏èüëèüèº
I don‚Äôt know where everything went wrong, but here recently it seems to have a mind if it‚Äôs own. I‚Äôll try to access the FB messenger app and then out of nowhere the app will freeze and then my phone restarts itself. It‚Äôs highly annoying having to do this every single time! It seems to happen randomly too and without warning. Usually it doesn‚Äôt take it long to lock up and boom my phone is restarting itself. I‚Äôve tried uninstalling and reinstalling it and it doesn‚Äôt seem to work... Highly annoyed.
It‚Äôs nice to not really leave Facebook to chat with friends.
Thanks for great service . I love it
SHAMEFUL that there are advertisements selling random stuff I don't need mixed in with my conversations. What happened to zuckerberg being against ads? Not worth my time anymore.
I love it! They keep making improvements that respond to the way I like to communicate with my Facebook friends. If only it were searchable‚Ä¶ ;D
Pound for pound the best social messenger service.
I used messenger when I couldn‚Äôt afford a phone! It really saved me.
Why are you forced to download this even if you access Facebook through a browser???
It‚Äôs FUN!!!!!
Such a useless app. I would like to open my messages on the Facebook website without being forced to go to messenger every time.
Messenger has been phenomenal; video chat, crystal clear calling and more. But the appearances of ads ?  Debating continuation of use. 
Esta muy bueno
The app is fine I‚Äôm just annoyed that Facebook forces you to download it if you want to read your messages from your phone
Unable to access my new message requests without it crashing since newest update. Have tried multiple times to access with no luck! Not even worth the one star due to this, but have to put one for it to send.
Call and see and hear me
It‚Äôs ok don‚Äôt like that I have to use a separate app from fb though
Mostly not useful
This is so well put together!!
I think what I miss is the setting. It seems that I can‚Äôt control my messenger  I would love to have an option to be able to delete my sent messages the way I can delete the received ones  I don‚Äôt like the long list of suggested friends  I don‚Äôt like the layout of people popping up at the top of the chatting window if I want someone I can find him/her 
Since the last update, I can‚Äôt see the last time my friends were active??? It was kind of handy, if I actually knew if they had been up not too long before me, or something, and not gone to bed yet.
I‚Äôm mean it‚Äôs Ight ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èion see no problem
So much fun. Excellent
Great communication app but it frequently tells you that you have unread messages when you‚Äôre looking right at them. If I‚Äôm in the stream, then why do you need to tell me I have a missed message......in the stream I‚Äôm currently viewing?
Great msg and FaceTime with Family and friends  üëå
Very good job  Wonderful Things 
iPhone 5s on newest iOS
Stop sending notifications to connect my contacts, no means no, stop
Ddsdeduiugdryhgt
since the new updates of the newer versions of the ios, the app crashes
Why is this app keep lagging now üëéüèΩ smh
I can‚Äôt see my calls anymore or how long I was on the phone
I‚Äôve used messenger many times over the years but now i can see what I‚Äôm typing. Not sure if there was an update that was done and made a mess of it or if that‚Äôs how they made it. Please please fix it.
I think Messenger is awesome I do vendor events every single weekend so I use messenger every single day I wouldn‚Äôt be able to be doing my business without it so thank you very much
Love the app, but sometimes voice messages don‚Äôt load properly
üòõ
Please come out with a easier way to delete MULTIPLE messages. It take an eternity to delete ppl you haven‚Äôt talked to since college especially if some messages you don‚Äôt want anymore.
Just like the option to change chat colors, but for profile pictures. Chat profile pictures.  It would be nice for us to be able to have profile pictures exclusive to chats, just like how the color of the chat is exclusive to the chat itself.   So that way we could, say, change our profile picture to our favorite sports team in a chat whilst keeping our selfies as our facebook page‚Äôs profile picture. Pretty simple to implement I imagine, and it would really make chatting lots more fun!   Please, if there‚Äôs anything you‚Äôre going to add to Messenger to rejuvenate it, let it be this. 
Excellent!!
I can communicate my family easily, all the times.Thank u fb. And messenger‚Äôs stuff‚ù§Ô∏è
I don‚Äôt understand sometimes my messages don‚Äôt want to go through
NOW THIS APP WATS TO LOAD ALL ADS BEFORE YOUR MESSAGES  PHOTOS TAKEN IN THIS APP ARE VERY DARK AND BLURRY FOR NO REASON!   STARTS RANDOMLY SENDING STICKERS AND OPENING OTHER CRAP BLOAT FEATURES IN THE MIDDLE OF TYPING! SOMETIMES APP WONT EVEN OPEN! VERY VERY LAGGY ON IPHONE 8 PLUS! Messaging is now the LEAST ACCESSIBLE FEATURE, and this app is called MESSENGER!  Starts randomly sending stickers IN THE MIDDLE OF TYPING A MESSAGE!  Want to save a photo? If you do, you have to watch the keyboard pop up and down 5 times FOR EVERY PHOTO YOU SAVE!!!!! what used to take 5 seconds now takes a minute per photo because the keyboard has to pop up and go away 100 times before you can even press save!!!!!!!!!!!!!! STICKERS ARE NOW VERY SLOW TO SEND AND VERY DELAYED AFTER TAPPIG THEM!  Now photos taken with the camera are VERY DARK even in bright light and so dark the screen is black in camera mode so you can't even see if you getting your picture right!!!!!!!  NOW THERES EVEN MORE CRAP BLOCKING ACCESS TO CONVERSATIONS! AND THE SCREENSHOTS OF COURSE ARENT UPDATED TO SHOW THIS CRAP AND ITS NEVER MENTIONED IN THE CHANGE LOG!!!!!!!!!   SCREENSHOTS STILL NOT UPDATED TO SHOW HOW HORRIBLE THE LAYOUT IS!!!!!! CLEARLY THEY ARE HIDING IT UNTIL YOU DOWNLOAD IT AND SEE HOW MUCH OF A CONFUSING MESS IT REALLY IS!  Anyone notice the screenshots for this app are STILL not updated to show the horrible crap new layout? And the change log is NEVER UPDATED! This should NOT BE ALLOWED BY APPLE!  NO MORE EASY QUICK WAY TO SEND PHOTOS WHILE IN A CONVERSATION! now you have to press the camera button on the main screen, then chose who to send the photo to, then go back, then open your conversation to resume talking. NO MORE CAMERA BUTTON WHILE IN CONVERSATION! Adds too many unnecessary steps and interface is very clunky and hard to navigate, and sections you hide will pop back up after 5 minutes, allowing you to have only 2 conversations in the app   Version is now all the way up to 98 and STILL CANT TAKE PHOTOS! Still has the same problem when trying to take photos. Pressing the button to take a photo just makes the "TINK!" Sound but never actually focuses or takes a photo. Also you can only see 2 conversations because they still show lots of extra things in the middle of your conversation list and force you to scroll through 2 pages of junk to see your conversations. "Hide" feature for the useless junk sections only stays for 5 minutes before it all reappears again!  Update for 10/12/2016 update: CANT TAKE PHOTOS! messenger makes the "tink" sound when pressing the button to take a photo but it never ends up taking the photo or even trying to focus. To send a photo you must use the camera app then go back to messenger find the photo and send it. Also you can no longer scroll up and respond to messages farther up in your chat history. Touching the keyboard causes it to scroll all the way back to the bottom again   Anyone else find it quite funny how the screenshots don't show the messed up new layout even after 30 updates?  5 more updates in a week and STILL stuck with the messed up layout that puts conversations at the very bottom of the main screen.   ANOTHER update (11 in the past 5 days) and the layout is STILL all cluttered with the stupid new layout and you can only have 3 conversations within the app, if you have more you have to find them on your computer!  Conversations are now all scrambled with no logical order. Very hard to find conversations now without the "recent" tab. Also the change log hasn't been updated since version 1.0. Why do you not show your sloppy layout in the app photos? The photos still show the neatly arranged "recents" tab which is replaced by the "home tab" that lists the same person 3 times 
My Messenger has been hacked several times!  I‚Äôve changed my Facebook password and am trying to download the Messenger app again, but it‚Äôs not working. I hope you‚Äôll help me know what to do. 
Thank you!
For the past week, a scammer has been messaging my friends begging for money.  I‚Äôve changed my password, set two factor authentication, forced all logins off and notified FB but the messages keep coming up to my friends when they can‚Äôt see any cloned account.  I don‚Äôt see the conversations but my fiends send me screen shots of whoever is begging for money.  I sent these screen shots to FB but nothing has changed.  I installed messenger on my phone to see if the conversations would show up there but they don‚Äôt.  I need this fixed or I‚Äôll have to leave FB!
Between ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äù and ‚ÄúFacebook messenger‚Äù and my iPhone and iPad...I do more Facebook updates than anything else in my life. It‚Äôs really becoming quite annoying. Every other day!
I need for messager to have a speak selected text. That‚Äôs it. Than 5 stars.
It works sometimes but not all the time
I see no reason why I should update the app every 2 weeks or so, and it constantly reminds me to do so, no new features but pointless updates
Thanks
GasBuddy is not working since the last update and I no longer get alerts for rising prices.
Cannot load in apple watch
So this app forces me to update just so they can shove more ads down my throat. Just what I needed
Stop having valid and rule compliant negative reviews removed from the app store.  Once again a ‚Äúnew‚Äù version of the app is out, and once again no actual improvements or requested features in the app. But the ‚Äúnew‚Äù version lets facebook hide bad reviews temporarily.  The calling feature *still* doesn‚Äôt work properly, just like it hasn‚Äôt worked properly from day one of it being introduced, no matter what kind of internet connection each party has. 
You guys need to stop drinking while writing code
Way to much spam. 90% of what I get is spam
Like the privacy
It is absolutely ridiculous that we have to use a separate app to read messages on FB anywhere other than a computer. I used to be able to get them on safari on my phone but now that doesn‚Äôt work either. This is FB sticking their noses where they don‚Äôt need to be stuck.
Great App!
I would like to be informed of exactly what the changes are each time there is an update instead of it always saying ‚ÄúWe update the app regularly to make better for you‚Äù.
Can‚Äôt figure out how to delete unwanted people on messenger
I accidentally hit the phone when I put my cell device in my pocket. If I‚Äôm done but I get distracted, quite a few times I‚Äôve hit the phone and found someone asking me what I want or it asks if I want to try again.   Other than this it‚Äôs fine 
Wonderful way to communicate with family and friends. Thank you for providing this service!! 
I would love it if we had the option to use a different notification tone for when we get a message. It‚Äôs really annoying to think you have a message when someone else‚Äôs phone goes of with your basic ‚Äúting‚Äù sound.
I have not been able to use messenger since the last update! I even went to the AT&T Store and they were unable to help me!!!
Please restore the ‚ÄòDelete Conversations‚Äô function!!!  We used to be able to swipe left (or right.  Hell, it‚Äôs been so long since this feature disappeared that I can‚Äôt remember!) and delete an ENTIRE conversation. Also, give us a description of the updates you release. It‚Äôs always the same old ‚Äúwe update the app regularly...‚Äù garbage. TELL US WHAT THE UPDATES CONTAIN!!  Are you listening????

I've been woken up the last two nights in a row by Facebook messenger notifications chiming through while I have my phone set on do not disturb (happens automatically every night, so it's not a issue on my end). Nothing else seems to be defeating the setting, just messenger, and it seems like a new/recent issue, so I'd assume something from the last update. My only option is to disable sound notifications on the app itself altogether until this bug gets sorted out.
Thumbs up
I have no words, this app is amazing.
On 2/15/18 my iPad showed that I had stuff that needed  To update. Pressed the update all button. Everything update just fine except messenger! The circle is still spinning and my messenger icon on desktop is dark! Any suggestions? 
The screen is too high and you can‚Äôt type done. You have to close the app and completely open it new.
Why I can‚Äôt update my Messenger app? Its now asking for Payment method/billing information. But I can install/updated all of my other apps without Payment Info.
Love the app. Easy to operate.
Duck this app
The video chatting needs to be more like FaceTime on the iPhone. The video chatting has terrible quality and even when the volume is up on both phones I can barely hear the other person.
Worldwide free chat and talking. it‚Äôs the one which has made the world more closer.
It‚Äôs good it jus need a little improvement
It‚Äôs very easy to make video calls and it‚Äôs working really greatüëç.
Hola, con el app no he tenido muchos problemas me funciona bien. S√≥lo quisiera que a√±adieran (como antes cuando esto no exist√≠a)Poder ver en categor√≠as (por llamarle as√≠) los msj. Estoy teniendo problemas tratando de encontrar mis msj archivados. Si pudieran arreglar eso le doy las 5 estrellas.
I can communicate long with friends and family all the world. What a convenient. Its awesome y‚Äôall gotta have download now, I‚Äôm serious.
If only unknown people would be kept from sending chat request
This app has never been anything but an annoyance. It‚Äôs as if it was specifically designed to aggravate people.  Absolute $#1t ! 
I love this app ‚ù§Ô∏è
Shouldn‚Äôt need an extra app just to read messages!

Messenger is convenient and can be a great interface. The invite function can be very annoying.   Please add a way to delete or edit... 
Please remove that feature if possible.
Gud aap
This is my go to app for communication I mean yeah it‚Äôs a bit buggy from time to time but come on its been out longer than some of the people on it have been alive. Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing add more and more to it everything y‚Äôall have done to it so far has only made it better.  Even if it is already great it still needs something more to make it grow bigger more customizable options are very much needed because the style hasn‚Äôt changed in years and now it‚Äôs a little outdated. Y‚Äôall are probably just going to run this off as a hate comment but come on it‚Äôs helpful criticism it‚Äôs needed to improve. I love the app and all out idea thanks for changing the way we talk online. 
It‚Äôs great
I use it more than FB
This app has become impossible to use without having to share all my contacts (none of their business) and since the last update you can no longer just swipe left, or do anything else, to delete a conversation!!  It's a pain as well that every time you start a new message it does not just continue with the persons name where you left off, but creates an entire new stream that is impossible to delete! I finally deleted the app today to get rid of all the redundant posts and to get rid of pictures that will not delete at all, and to my surprise (shock!) I downloaded the app again and they were still there!  I liked it when it was. Attached to Facebook, I do not like it now!! Would give it zero stars if I could and I am getting rid of it!
After sending the below message I reinstalled my messenger and with in five minutes a message with my picture showed up. Help!  Had someone on messenger use my picture to open a messenger acct. told my friends I had won the lottery and I needed 10 grand to get my winnings. Almost impossible to report it. Got off messenger for awhile but trying again. 
I love this app easita just like texting!
Just keeps loading and does not work at all on Apple Watch.
This app is now overloaded with junk.  I do not want Facebook connections added automatically and there is no setting to control this.  Security is poor, accounts are often breached, and virus laden content can be transmitted through this app.Bring back the ‚Äòlite‚Äô version which was excellent.  ‚ÄòLite‚Äô is available to other countries,but not in the US. Give us the option to choose
Ok
I enjoy using it but I was contacted by a stalker and wasn‚Äôt able to report him to Facebook because after he called me a life name he blocked me. Working on contacting the PD for help.
Messenger offers one the ability to communicate with everyone on FB being in your business, I enjoy that about messenger, EVERY THING does not need to be public knowledge.
When sending a photo directly from the "Photos" Album (not the FB Messenger app itself), you can't send 3 or more photos, otherwise the FB Messenger app will freeze and won't work at all.  I can only send 2 photos at a time directly from the Photos Album.  This has been an issue for several months now.  I'm on iPhone with iOS 8.4 
It‚Äôs not working right any more. I can pull up all of my messages in the browser, but the app doesn‚Äôt show any of them.
I miss the inbox being integrated in the native app! Ever since you decided to make it a separate app, Messenger has been T.Rash!

Apple Watch Issues constant issue
I'm running messenger on mini iPad with iOS 9.3.5. The app crashes on welcome screen. Please fix.
I just got me a Apple Watch and I still can‚Äôt login Into my messager on my Apple Watch and both my phone and Apple Watch is up to date and the bug still haven‚Äôt been fix... please fix this bug so I can read my message on my Apple Watch
It‚Äôs not loading .
I like messenger, but I use to be able to write messages in paragraphs. Why they changed this feature... I can‚Äôt imagine. Please fix it so we can do paragraphs again!
After last update the button of active/inactive disappeared and can‚Äôt turn of the chat and be inactive. Today updated again hoping that it will fix the problem but no changes. I don‚Äôt want to be active for 24 hours and can‚Äôt find any solution :/
It's been years. This is still dumb. Recombine the apps.
I‚Äôve changed the automatic replies, cycled the Bluetooth on and off, cycled airplane mode,  uninstalled and reinstalled the app on the iPhone and Apple Watch. I cannot get the Apple Watch Facebook messenger app connect at all anymore. What gives?
Won't install or delete. Breaks messenger completely.   No value. Collects more information on end users. Takes up more space on our devices. Constant updates we don't want. Messaging within the native app worked better.   Be sure to turn off location services or your battery will get blown to hell.  Continued failures by Facebook. Notifications are not needed. Stop alerting on the once I have turned them off.  Updating again. And again. 
Messenger updated today and now I have 2 ‚Äúapp squares‚Äù on my phone. It installed a new one. Why ? And the one that was already on my phone is now like a shadow in the background. I can‚Äôt click on it and I can‚Äôt delete it.
App is great now. Just keep fixing bugs and other little things but not anything big and it‚Äôll be good.
Please add a feature that allows users to select and delete messages. Deleting one by one is painful. Also, I don‚Äôt want to receive messages of friends that I have accepted it‚Äôs clogging up my message board.
The UI is waaaaay too jumbled and confusing at this point for new users. A new fresh simplified UI would do this app wonders at this point.
I just don‚Äôt understand why they didn‚Äôt put a log out button?? Good app regardless 
Why can't I just use Facebook
When I receive Spam/Phishing messages, it is impossible to delete messages without opening them and therefore my FB is infected and I send those messages without my consent. I‚Äôve tried to follow the directions I‚Äôve read online to just swipe right to delete without opening but all it does is switch screens to active users. There needs to be a user friendly way to delete old/read messages. My inbox is clogged with things from years ago. It‚Äôs incredibly annoying that deleting is this difficult. Please update and revise.
It‚Äôs helpful to talk to people but this is so annoying. Like I hate being notified on my phone with these kinds of apps so I always say no but every single time I open this app, it tries to force me into getting notified. I JUST SAID I DONT WANT TK GET NOTIFIED AND YOURE STILL GOING TO ASK ME. I‚Äôm not caving but that is so annoying. Take a hint messenger. No is no.
Recently I have noticed that some of my friends last active status is not showing, when I go into a friend's conversation I don't see when was last active but it show up later on. Some friends still have it some are not.  FYI, all of them have the online status turned on.  I think it's a bug! 
This could be a feature readily available in the already bloated and memory sucking main app, but instead, it‚Äôs a whole new app draining precious memory space. Why do we need a supplementary app for an existing app? It‚Äôs baffling.
I was pretty sure that on an older version of Messenger on your homepage it would show if someone read your message yet so you wouldn‚Äôt have to click into each one to see if they read it yet or not.  Would REALLY appreciate that feature!! Even if it was just a little green check next to the name or something!! 
I have tried several times to set this app up and it never sends me the code to activate it on my phone.
No password protection no log out feature invasion of privacy

I love the blue label messenger wow keep the good work FB you guys got it all working #goodjob
okay so i‚Äôm here to just say that id like to have the chat bubbles on apple like they do on android. i dont know but i thought that was more useful then having to get on the app and not being able to do anything else but only do that but if we have chat bubbles we could be off the app and still on something like just like android!
I really don't have issues with messenger on my phone, but on my series 2 apple watch it's atrocious. If I don't run the app every time I get a message, it bogs down and refuses to load. I have to uninstall and reinstall, then have my phone unlocked with messenger open to load it. And if I don't run the app on my watch, after about 4 messages, it starts all over again. Dropped from a 5 star to 3 because I basically can't use it on one of my devices.
Video calls are fantastic, just loved it every single day
Stop sending invites to my friends list!
90% of the time I click on the Messenger icon in Facebook, I‚Äôm asked if I want to open Messenger in the App Store.  But I have to! - unless I quit FB and open the Messenger app.  But then I am likely redirected to the App Store and forced to update.  No other app does this anywhere nearly as often.
This is not a secure app even with 2 factor authentication. I constantly have numerous unknown devices in different locations logged in. Messages being sent I didn‚Äôt send....in today‚Äôs world...free or not security in our digital age is an utmost concern for parents and our kids.
J have the Apple Watch and keep trying to load the app on it but all I get on my new Apple Watch is a black screen and loading while
Initially i was constantly using this messenger to get in touch with my good friend who is diagnosed with cancer. After using for a few months, it suddenly stopped working without any errors. I thought i sent messages to her but it didn't go through to her at all. After she's dead, I realised not only her but others as well didn't receive my messages. It didn't show any errors at all. I reinstall and updating it for a few times, it keep showing 'Couldn't load conversation'. This app is a total disappointment. It doesn't deserves even a star.
When I first got my watch, the Messenger app worked fine. Within the last two weeks, the app won't even open properly; it tries to open but sits at a spinning wheel as if it's trying to load. I have tried reinstalling the app, resetting my watch, removing the Messenger iPhone app.  Everything! I would use this app all the time if it would just open. Very exasperating.
CRAP!!!
Having a hard time deleting my account been hack twice üò™
I received a pornographic picture today on my messenger thru a dear friend.  I could not delete it, so I took out the whole app.  How can I prevent this from happening again? I am going to reinstate Messenger again.  Will my friends be returned??
People should not be able to call me if my notifications are off and I should be able to turn my active status off and not be ‚Äúlast seen‚Äù through Facebook!!
This app is a wonderful app. Some people think this app is a waste of time but, noooo there wrong. Its great! You can connect to your Facebook account! You can talk to your friends! Go ahead hatters. Say what you want. But this app is the best app!
Besides the spying it keeps freezing on me. If you're going to spy why don't you do it when complete strangers send me nude pictures of themselves?
I refuse to use it. Basically if I get do get a message it sits until I remember to check FB on my computer.
I had to delete Messenger app as I started getting spam messages from "friends" that were very weird! I reported as Spam and deleted app. This app is very unsecured. I thought that "in the old" days I could get Messenger through Facebook without the app? I miss Messenger, but now I'm afraid to use it! Any advice? Any other problems with Spam?
Biggest mistake I made to update! As a business owner it frustrates me that my update kept popping up in messenger to update and I finally did and lost 100‚Äôs of messages from customers, family and friends! Very important messages! I am soooo aggravated! I am most likely going to delete this app and als let others know to not update!
Why am I getting advertisements in my messenger app?! Also we need more face masks on the messenger video chat. Don‚Äôt do anything half way.
This app was great but all of the sudden about 2 days ago, anytime I try and open the app it crashes and closes out. I've tried deleting and redownloading, turning my phone off etc. Please fix this
What happened? When I open my messenger and it stops my phone keeps on rebooting. I use my iphone 6. Why is that? Please fix it and make it stable like the older version.
Actually be able to switch/ log out of accounts
I‚Äôm only able to see recent messages from this month but not my previous messages from when I first joined up onto last month are not showing at all please fix
I‚Äôve just finished reading reviews here and I‚Äôll address a couple of things first. I‚Äôm grateful Facebook is trying to research people before letting them in; although, the Russians who ruined our election are already in, I‚Äôm afraid. I would like a choice of notification tones, but a background picture or whatever? I don‚Äôt spend that much time just looking at the screen. I type my message, go away, come back when I get a response. It does connect with your FB contacts. It easily attaches articles and pictures. It is speedy and reliable. It is free. It is an alternative to the phone call, allowing people to get my thought and respond at their leisure-just like regular phone texts.
Speaker option not working please fix!
I will not use this app, and if Facebook tries to force me to, I will no longer use Facebook.  I am calling on Apple to carefully review the access and privileges this app requires. IMHO, it violates the AppStore terms of service and should be REMOVED from the AppStore. 
Im having so much trouble with this app on my Iwatch. It just stays loading the app will not open!! The only way it will open is if someone sends a message. Please fix!!
Don‚Äôt rely on the developers to help you with anything. I have had an issue with messenger on my Apple Watch series 3 and they won‚Äôt fix the programming or reply on how to solve the issue.
App crashes after I edit (rotate a photo) using messenger and send it to someone.
They just sent my phone number to my e-mail address! What if someone hacked my account?! They‚Äôd have my name number too?  If you care about security, use other apps.  Update: Too much going on. Dulls the senses. 
I only use it for a very short period of time and then DELETE IT...  They with your permission control everything in your computer !!!  VERY BAD APP ........ 
Just Facebook Forces It Down Your Throat To Get The App!
Have downloaded three times after it stopped working on my iPad. No matter what, it will not work, not even from the Facebook app. Can't share anything in private!

I like Messenger but when I try to verify my messages on my watch 1st series it just keeps loading. I‚Äôve tried uninstalling apps on both my watch and iPhone and nothing happens.
I was shocked to see so much whinning and complaints in the feedbacks. Messenger is free, Facebook is free, they both have a great design and come with awesome FREE features. There‚Äôs always room for improvement but overall I‚Äôm super happy with these apps, they honestly make our lives a lot easier.   Btw all these people complaining should go back in time and use the Yahoo Messenger, that was a real struggle and nobody complained back then ;) 
good for communication to all our live one...and business associated too...!!!
I wish I could rate this app 0 stars!  I press to sign in as myself, then the useless messenger app presents me with some kind of dialog box I have to hit accept on (I assume), only 99% of the dialogue box is off screen!  How can you FAIL at something so basic, as oh I dunno, LETTING USERS FREAKING SIGN IN AND USE YOUR APP!  Zero stars to the severely brain injured primates who "programmed" this "app".  Useless, abysmal, a prime example of how NOT to program an app!
The app won‚Äôt work on my Apple Watch. It just has a loading ring and I have the Apple Watch series 3 with cellular on Verizon so I have plenty of signal
It's a space and battery hog. If I do not wish to have notifications turned on that is my choice. Do not ask me to turn on notifications every time the app is opened. No I don‚Äôt want notifications turned on.
Recently when I tapped the message I sent to my friend and I pressed delete, it doesn‚Äôt want to delete it. I‚Äôve tried everything, from deleting the app and re-downloading it and resetting my IPad and also resetting my internet but nothing happened. I think this app needs to be updated.
My account has been hacked and there is nothing I can do about it! I have gone through all the procedures and people are still receiving messages saying they‚Äôre from me. Asking my friends for money saying they will get more money. It‚Äôs a scam! Face book and messenger, even though they are linked, I cannot get help on addressing this problem specifically with messenger. Very discouraged because I will have to disconnect my Facebook page and it has a lot of pictures and things that are valuable to me and my business. Facebook/messenger needs to do more to protect its users.
Inconsistent app. Crashes after you open app. Slow updates.
I can‚Äôt see none of my messages from 2017
ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤
Where‚Äôs the archived messages?
my facebook messenger doesn‚Äôt load and it just keeps crashing so can you please improve this app it doesn‚Äôt work it just gives me the loading sign for a long time till it goes black.
App crashes every time I send more than two photos. Then I have to delete the app and reload it for it to work. Frustrating
App doesn‚Äôt work on Apple Watch always on black screen and loads
Kept getting notifications to ‚ÄúTurn On Notifications‚Äù.  App deleted. 
There is one difficulty in contacting company on Facebook. Company, Chatbot, please put the function of green mark  when online, please. Thank you~ However, it is difficult to confirm whether it is active  Typically replies instantly, 5 minutes response,etc Have a nice day~ 
Just got a brand new iPhone 6 and when opening FB messenger from another app phone completely shuts offüò≠ otherwise would give better rating.
Advertising on instant messages, Facebook has totally crossed the line. Especially when their app isn‚Äôt the best messaging app.
1. While you‚Äôre on call with loud speaker on if you turn the display off = you end the call immediately. So annoying!!! 2. While you‚Äôre on call with loud speaker on and you face the phone down to make display goes off static noise start coming off the speaker for no reason, but when you turn the phone face up left the display on the whole time is ok. Who would need to leave there display on while they are talking???!!!  I‚Äôm switching to Tango, Skype or viber doesn't these issue. 
The videos constantly have issues when you start playing and then turn your phone sideways. Please make it not pause.
As if the Facebook app has enough ads and now they bring them into messenger. This is not cool. Your already annoying as it is. We don‚Äôt need the stupid ads in messenger. I will keep reporting them as spam if you keep this crap up.
Very good
Return call details in the conversation (call time,  call duration) to the previous version
All I get is circles going round and round
It‚Äôs beyond annoying when it asks you to rate your call after EVERY SINGLE CALL. Please change that.
This app is a bad app. I try to call my friends and it will say they are in another call and I know there not. I tried it out with another phone and it dose the same. It is somehow messing my account up. Facebook its funny how you try so hard to be the best only realizing you not even as good as aol. Fix your app it‚Äôs stupid how this is happening.
i just noticed ALLLL my messages (besides group messages) were deleted when i update the app!!!!! how the hell does that happen!!!
Just keeps loading and nothing happens
We need streaks on messenger
It‚Äôs not loading all my messages it‚Äôs showing messages from 2012 it‚Äôs freaking 2018
This app will attempt to coerce you into updating by making more and more intrusive 'reminders.' I don't recommend updating much of anything unless you have an iPhone 7 and up, at least not until Apple stops throttling performance in their iOS.  Even when the app is updated it attempts to corral you into using other apps. For example, YouTube and other ads are embedded directly as messages. 
Clicking on a Facebook link in the Messenger will open an in-app web view with the web version of Facebook (why not FB app??) with NO OPTION to share outside the Facebook platform (as a status or in Messenger).  Not opening the native iOS share menu is a cheap move guys...  at the very least you should let us copy the link! 
‚ù• Messenger enables me to keep in contact with all my family and my friends that I am not able to see on a daily basis due to distance. Plus I do like the fact that there\'s a lot of other cool fun things that messenger features like games and silly little things like that along with this silly little pictures you can send to your friends especially to cheer them up whenever you need to so yeah that\'s about it if it weren\'t for that I wouldn\'t even bother using mess but then again I pretty much have to use Messenger especially when ever I say that I have unread messages that means I have to get the Messenger app because now I can\'t ever check the messages even on Facebook using Safari so I don\'t know why the how that happened but now y\'all have like forced every single one of us to have to now install Facebook along with the Facebook messenger app so not just one app but two apps so you know thanks‚ù•
I don‚Äôt like the fact that people can call you through Facebook. If I wanted someone to call me, I‚Äôd give them my phone number! There should be an option as to where we could allow the calls or not. Absolutely ridiculous.
Add higlights
I don‚Äôt understand why we have to download a completely separate app just to message people on Facebook. It‚Äôs a waste of space when I could just be able to look at my messages on the FB app.
G.a.y af
I can not get this app to open!!! I have tried everything!!!! Please help me
Lately the group chat I‚Äôve been in has been glitching messages vanishing messages moving up and down in the order they were sent it is a mess
Can you guys add more colors to the chat... like black, and more emoji options too? üèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüí®
I can‚Äôt open my messenger app! It‚Äôs been two months since it disappeared off of my iPhone. Facebook app disappeared too. I have iPhone 6. I have been updating it. Is this why it disappeared??
Still not happy having to download two separate apps from the same company to access basic functionality.
I can‚Äôt get on messenger the icon just keeps spinning around and I have messages to look at.
So I‚Äôve been peeved with this app for YEARS now, and after getting an Apple Watch, I find there are more reasons to dislike this app! It doesn‚Äôt even load on the Apple Watch! I don‚Äôt get ANY notifications for chats because the Apple Watch app literally will not load. This is unacceptable. I‚Äôve tried troubleshooting it, and a Google search shows that this is a very widespread issue. Nothing works though, so this is terrible that Facebook of all places cannot make an app that works. My original review from years ago: I hate I'm being forced to download this app just to use messenger. It worked just fine in the native app, so forcing users to download ANOTHER app to chat is ridiculous. I only use messenger occasionally so this is a major hassle. This also takes up extra space on my phone, which is really annoying. 
Does not work on my Apple Watch series 3 LTE and is very frustrating
I have used this app for years, but with the most recent update I have found endless bugs. For one, it won't let me use speaker phone when I call someone. It drives me up a wall. Secondly, there have been times when my messages would just disappear from the conversation. Like chunks of it just disappear and I'm back to a convo from three days ago. If I close and open the app enough it fixes it but it's annoying. Thirdly, I can't pull up pictures from conversations in the info tab anymore. I have saved hundreds of pics by sending them to people to be retrieved later and now I can't. The new update doesn't help this at all.
Watch app is complete and utter garbage. The same bug ever since forever won‚Äôt let it finish opening so you get to stare at a never-ending progress spinner for a decade or as long as you want. Do not want. Fix it.
There is no need for this app. If you log in to fb you should be able to inbox anyone. This app was created and now  inforced if you want to message in Facebook. Keep in mind that they are  recording all your conversations outside the app.
I cannot delete people, even ones I blocked on fb. Can‚Äôt find out from help. The app updates a couple of times a week with no explanation.  I stopped updating it until some explanation is given each time. Who knows what is being uploaded... 
This fast paced ever changing world of technology is almost too much to handle. As a newbie to computer software and web design ( after being on the internet in the 90‚Äôs and studying web design in college in 2016, thinking I know something about computers) I now see how difficult it is to keep up to date on our sites, I can‚Äôt imagine what keeping up a site like Facebook entails. These reviews are hilarious, all I want for messenger is to see my messages. I haven‚Äôt been able to see anything on my phone in weeks, only on the desktop. Unfortunately Facebook has the worst customer service, but again I can‚Äôt imagine what the high volume must be like. You guys are doing great, but why can‚Äôt I see my messages???
Y‚Äôall should add chat heads to messenger for the iPhones...
Constantly freezing. Doesn‚Äôt tell me when there‚Äôs a message. Can‚Äôt scroll down to move messages without freezing. Can‚Äôt do much without freezing. I‚Äôve tried deleting and redownloading. No help. What‚Äôs the point.
This app just never seem to get it right despite the constant update. One good feature was the ‚Äúday‚Äù and suddenly it acts up and I can‚Äôt watch. Audio added suddenly I can‚Äôt hear properly or it just crash or froze. Maybe focus on the problem the long term quality of the updates rather the quantity of the updates.
At least add an option to delete multiple threads at once.
i tried several times to install and uninstall fb messenger on my apple watch but for some reason it would not load the messages i have on messenger. it would not let me use the app
Every time i open the app my phone power off!
I am unable to get on also!
Many people have been struggling to use the app on watches. It just stays on the loading screen and never works.
It doesn‚Äôt move the conversation above the keyboard, the last messages and writing messages sometimes are below the keyboard, FIX IT
this app is literally perfectly fine, i‚Äôve been reading the reviews and they‚Äôre outrageousüòÇ
i deactivated my facebook and it let me post stories on my messenger so it would be easier for me but now i deactivated my facebook and it won‚Äôt let me post any stories and nobody can see it, why is that ???? i need help
Stop sending stupid ‚Äúturn notification on‚Äù warning every time I open this app - I don‚Äôt want notification ON!!  Have respect for people‚Äôs autonomy and stop manipulating humans - this is not ethical. This just show me all the recent talk about respect for users privacy and well being is just empty talk.  Just furious - if I get this turn on notification more - I will probably delete this app and start using WeChat!!!
I don‚Äôt like having to install apps in place of using a website. Facebook is just garbage. Their app might use your information to help governments track citizens. They may use your information to hurt democracy.
It keeps powering off my whole phone when I get on it
You can't delete more than one message at once!?!? This is absurd. How am I supposed to delete 300 messages?
So disappointed. Tried to join Facebook messenger. Can‚Äôt get in.
The pictures aren‚Äôt there when I want to go back and look at them it‚Äôs like if I never sent them
I have a quick question I want everyone to read and thing about. Why does Facebook have a completely separate app for messaging? It is so unnecessary and frustrating. Also all of the unnecessary notifications. This is why only people 35 and up use this app. It‚Äôs garbage
It won‚Äôt send me the code and I‚Äôm so mad üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
I never had a problem with app, I use it for international calls when I‚Äôm overseas, and it‚Äôs the only way people can talk to me privately if they do not know my phone number but are in my contacts in Facebook. I love it!
I can never load my messages it‚Äôs so frustrating because ppl have to write on my Facebook wall telling me to check my messages. I‚Äôve installed and uninstalled it a dozen times but it still gives me issues.
Please add touch id login. Its very important for us. Thanks
Best app
Cuando estoy hablando por llamada o video llamada le quiero subir y cuando pasa eso se te apaga el tel√©fono y se prende varias beses pueden arreglar eso no soy el √∫nico que le pasa esto lla me esta enfadando..!?
After the last update, the duration of call or video does not display any more; I really hate this change because I need call and video durations for documentation purposes; without this feature, I would have to rather use another chat app as main.
Please stop asking if I want to turn notifications on! No, I absolutely don't want to or need to. Every time I open it though I get that pop up. I don't live on Facebook. I appreciate it but I don't need it all immediately. 
I did not ask for ads on messenger they just started showing up. I want them off or I‚Äôm taking messenger off my phone.
Is this a racist response to American technology?  As your elementary school teacher once told you or perhaps more than once, " if you're going to do it, do it right!"  It denies one the ability to delete both read and unread messages. ‚òπÔ∏è 
I had been loaded in to Facebook and it kick me off
Everyone that complaining about there account gets disable are pedophiles
Several friends including myself was hacked.i deleted itbut want to install with new password. How?
One it‚Äôs annoying that you have to go to another app for messages. It‚Äôs annoying for the app to keep trying to turn my notifications on. If I don‚Äôt want them on then I don‚Äôt want them on. Should have to close out the stupid tap every effing 5 mins. Then also it always having who is active pop up and then you gotta wait for it to disappear so I can click to go back to Facebook.
Well... everything works for me except for the messenger app in Apple Watch (it stays on the loading screen and never works ) hope you guys fix it soon and the call quality is a little poor for me..
The app never loads, can‚Äôt see your messages, and get annoying notifications that almost never go away. Facebook ‚Äúnotifies‚Äù you when you make a friend, it asks you to connect on messenger. All around bad app. There are tons of other messenger apps that work better. I get more ‚Äòjunk‚Äô notifications than purposeful notifications so I deleted it.
Hate that I am forced to install this app!
This site needs a lot of help. Downloads but that's it.
Great way of staying in touch with friends, but I don‚Äôt like a few of the updates.  I don‚Äôt really like being told which friends are online while I‚Äôm talking to other friends. It‚Äôs kinda stressful to see a friend I don‚Äôt want to talk to pop up.  M suggestions needs to go away. I don‚Äôt want to be given stickers, Spotify, or suggested responses. It feels like a machine is taking over my communication, by deciding what appropriate responses there are. 
It‚Äôs not loading and has a bug it seems like on my Apple Watch series 3 which is super frustrating
I‚Äôve tried turning them off and then back on again in the Settings app. I‚Äôve tried deleting the app and reinstalling it. Nothing has worked. Notifications are broken on the iPhone X! This is beyond frustrating when trying to sell things on Marketplace!!!
I had pneumonia that‚Äôs why couldn‚Äôt come over and help my son that‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt seen Kylie a couple years that‚Äôs what I was seeing Addison it to July 4 of 2017 I was in the hospital from most two years there‚Äôs no way I can I help I‚Äôm so sorry son Donnie please help me tell her please
I still don‚Äôt understand Facebook having its own messenger app when things were easier and more efficient when we could chat on the actual Facebook app way back when. I wish iPhones had a little chat bubble on the side like Androids do for easier access rather than going into the actual app. Video chatting is quite annoying when I press speaker it glitches out and chooses when it wants to be on speaker on its own. Pictures that are sent in the chat aren‚Äôt all together when you click for more info. It‚Äôs frustrating, really. Facebook apparently updates its apps every two weeks, so how come these minor things have not been fixed yet?
I can not get the app to work on my Apple Watch at all. All I get is the loading screen. I‚Äôve seriously tried EVERYTHING I‚Äôve found online to attempt to resolve the issue. Every website says it‚Äôs Facebook not patching whatever glitch it has. This was going to be one of the main things I use this Watch for and it won‚Äôt even work. I do occasionally get a message alert if someone messages me on Facebook so there appears to be some hope.
Neat
Exellent and make my day full of fun!
Hey Messenger team, we don‚Äôt need a new message window or notification on Messenger as soon as we accept a friend request on Facebook, or add a new friend. Stop it.  Seriously, stop.  You‚Äôre just adding more feces on top of the steaming pile that is the rest of the app.
Change the keyboard back please no liky!
Will not connect with app watch
These ads everywhere are getting so ridiculous and now I'm seeing them in my messenger. This is what I call greedy.
Can‚Äôt use the app at all since the most recent update. Can‚Äôt even do a report because the whole app freezes as soon as it‚Äôs launched. Good job, team.
Deber√≠a existir la opci√≥n de darle responder a los mensajes como en WhatsApp  Y poder reenviar los videos a otras plataformas 
Still? After all this time you can‚Äôt get the Watch app to work? Cmon
Good
I DON'T like you trying to FORCE me to turn on notifications!!! Turn OFF the big red 1 superimposed on my profile pic!!!!
Going to delete you
It‚Äôs ridiculous that you have to download and use this app to use messenger, and that messages are disabled on the mobile site!
I want to know why messenger is trying to charge me for the app after it froze and I deleted it and tried to reinstall it?
It used to work amazing with more than one account, but now I am asked to re-log in every time and add a phone number and a code. For the love of messages, this is not user friendly at all.
please give us the option to save audio messages and videos sent to us through messenger
My keyboard glitches really bad with this app and never has done that before until recently. It gets insanely annoying having to close and reopen the app just to type 2 words. Also I would like to request that you add more chat bubble colors. More color variety would be nice  Feb 9 2018,  REMOVE THE FRICKIN ADS ü§¨ 
For the 100x time, I do not want notifications
Buen mensaje pero hay momentos que las v√≠deo llamadas no funciona a como deber√≠a ser aveses el audio est√° muy bajo y momentos que se escucha bien Otra cosa por qu√© se calienta mi celular cuando estoy platicando por video llamada  Buenas tardes aplicaci√≥n de Messenger no funciona en video llamada y la otra persona no me escucha para nada ni yo a ellos 
Last update keeps crashing iPhone 6+ & powers phone down & restarts!
Whenever someone messages me, it chimes. Even though my iPad is ON MUTE. Does facebook not know what mute means? Boo on you, facebook, boo on you. May minor inconveniences in life happen to the entire messenger development team until they fix this.
It's a great way to communicate w/ fam & friends
I like the privacy that messenger provides, away from commenting on posts in public.  Very convenient 
There is too many copy cats
Easy to use!
Why I have The Emoji Not Real..??
.... I like the app. It‚Äôs cool lol I guess.
Messenger has improved a lot, I request/recommend to improve more on the video chat. Thank you Messenger.
Nic
Great app
GIFs don‚Äôt work and muting a conversation doesn‚Äôt stop notifications anymore. Multi million dollar company and you can‚Äôt get an app right.
Too many chain letters
just hate how it demands me to turn my notifications on every five seconds
Since he latest update 2/7/2018, the Pok√©mon go app seems to freeze/crash when receiving messenger messages while playing .  Using latest I-phone 8+ with all updates applied.  Didn‚Äôt crash previously.
What‚Äôs wrong with a new update !!! Every time i tried to open the app it keeps loading then it close by itself
Doesn‚Äôt work on the Apple Watch at all. It worked about 3 times and now it‚Äôs just stuck on a loading screen. I‚Äôve researched and tried all of the tricks. I‚Äôm not about to try to erase all of my data on my phone and my watch just to get a free app to work on my $300 Watch. You can do without the app.
???? I GIVE UP!!!  I‚Äôve tried more times than I can count & STILL don‚Äôt have a clue!!  Too damned difficult & complicated! 
Messenger is the best app to make audio calls around the world with great clarity. Plus when I‚Äôve videoed with my family in Australia, the picture was clear as was the the audio. I use this app daily and would rate it a 20 if I could.
Please , in your next facebook update or can you create a App to notify you when someone browse thru or on your facebook page,... Even if they don't click like or leave a commit. I would like to know who's checking my page out in they spare time, and just not saying nothing. Thank You, very much. Still Great use everyday
After doing the most recent update my messenger will not load on my Apple Watch. Very disappointing. Have tried every ‚Äúfix‚Äù the internet has to offer. Seems to be a going problem with a lot of folks
Based on strong network messenger is good like other apps. I like it.
Everyone is on Messenger so you can't not have it. But man, ads in line in the message list - that's brazen for a company hell-bent on destroying the fabric of society...
I‚Äôm disappointed with the games on messenger and I have written directly through the games SEVERAL times stating the problems but have NEVER received a message back, nor has the problem been fixed ! Many of the games offer to let you watch a video to earn extra coins, extra lives, etc, but when you choose to watch the video to get your free lives or whatever, it always says ‚Äúerror‚Äù or ‚Äúsorry no video available‚Äù !! Why offer it if you‚Äôre not going to allow us to use it ??!!! Makes no sense !
Messenger is my main form of communication with my boyfriend who lives in another country. With the latest update, it‚Äôs removed my access to our shared media in the app. This is devastating to me because we have sent back and forth all of our pictures from trips and other events and I‚Äôve never downloaded them because I could always get to them from the app. Please give me back access or at least allow me to choose who I want to have shared media with in settings.
Want my business to be more private.
It‚Äôs so nice to be able to send a quick message to someone when you want a little bit more privacy rather than doing it directly in Facebook.
I don‚Äôt love that anyone can contact me but I love that blocked button
Seriously
Free is great cannot bargain with the outcomes and usage!
I'be enjoyed messenger. Not a fan of the ads these days.
I use Messenger to connect with family and friends. It is so easy. I have also called overseas using Messenger and we could hear each other. So wonderful.
No complaints. Still the best messenger service for video/audio call and text.
I think it's a very useful app, for people who don't want to talk on the phone but want to communicate. It works very well.
Thanks
I have no idea how this works. Nothing I have tried works
Every time you update this app, it gets worse to load. Leave well enough alone!
A very reliable means of communication and a legitimate messenger.
Poorly designed UI. Required for chat. Every time you go into app (even if you just swapped to another app for 1 second) it asks you to turn on notifications.  Also now random garbage ads!  Another reason I avoid using Facebook as opposed to any other option available. 
Again
If I want to delete someone from my phone book on Messenger how do I do that?! And how do I report ppl that are scammers?!
Excellent Apps very quick response if you call messenger to messenger , voice messaging its Awesome overall is excellent ..
Sometime I wish there wasn‚Äôt an app need to access it.  Apps take up to much space on my phone.l along with everything else.  Which is irritating!!!
This app is great! It‚Äôs easy to use and does what it was made to do: send messages! I use it all the time.
Great helps me stay in touch with my grown kids
I like messenger it is a good way to keep track of chatter between friends and such...
What is this a dating apps? Why am I getting so many guys looking for love? I am a happy person but this is making my skin crawl.
More privacy and deleting options
I‚Äôm unable to open messenger on the Apple Watch series 3!! Very Frustrating please fix!
First of all, this app has so many features now I just love them being able to make group chats are amazing and I love the filters sometimes I even wonder how this app is so good 5/5 stars for you Facebook and messenger
Messenger has been very useful to me and my family and friends abroad. Thanks!
No life without you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
You understand free will and all but you guys are part to blame . Oedipus!!!!!
This is an amazing app, especially since i can cut off my notifications and ignore others when i desire to....üòÇü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I hate writing these so when asked you get 1 Star
I love communicating with friends and family. Messenger helps me to keep in touch .
Used messenger for years, works great talking to friends and family!!!!!
Our granddaughter was undergoing chemo out of town, this app was an excellent way to have a face to face conversation during this time. Thank you!
I like it when it works but sometimes it bugs out
First off I use messenger to contact ppl mainly ppl who I am very close to, now it doesn‚Äôt show the time stamp on messenger or just says ‚Äúmessenger‚Äù not showing when the person was last active.
Protect with Surveillance.
Messenger and Facebook needs to be one app! They should be able to integrate all of these features into the Facebook app seamlessly.
I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs my cell phone or not, but the majority of the time I am trying to respond, the prompt is gone causing me grief. For God‚Äôs sake!  Text me. I loathe social media, medium in any form. It‚Äôs creepy. Who cares you found your friend from grade school?????  Who puts their personal life into cyberspace?  I was raised differently.  And I‚Äôm very proud
Thing get improved and better than before. The minute pop out is helpful. Thank you for your effort and work so hard !!
Tried restarting my iPhone and Apple Watch ‚åöÔ∏è & deleting & reinstalling the app on both, but messages won‚Äôt load and keep seeing a loading on the Ô£ø Watch üôÉ

I want the ability to turn off active
It is now inaccessible and will not open.

I do not want Facebook messenger. I get on FB very little and I don‚Äôt need ppl contacting me for work related things on my personal FB page. I have deleted messenger but I want to deactivate it. I DO NOT WANT MESSAGES SENT TO ME! I had to change my cover photo to a photo of the ways a client can contact me but it does no good when they can‚Äôt see my cover photo in the messenger app
I love the new upgrade
I enjoy Messenger, but I do not like getting all the spam messages (most likely with a virus attached) and no way to get the notification off my phone w/o clicking on the message. Please put a delete option so these can be deleted w/o reading them. PLEASE!
Awesome app and all, but(!) I‚Äôm missing one huge important thing: a way to categorize conversations. See, I‚Äôm a photographer and sometimes I work on personal projects with many (30+) different people. I‚Äôm missing a way that makes it possible to put some of these conversations into groups such as ‚Äúactive,‚Äù ‚Äúpassive,‚Äù and ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù.
Every time you update there are positives but also you changes things that didn‚Äôt need to change. Before you could click on the person‚Äôs name when in a conversation and see photos between the two of you. Now you can‚Äôt. With every update I feel more annoyed.
Very cool mensenger of this app
Very informative!!!
I love Messenger.  Works great, especially if you‚Äôre the playful type who likes using the cartoons and emojis.
Wish the alert ping could be louder.
They should indifini
Awesome app üòÉüëçüèº
Do not write anything in Messenger that you don‚Äôt want the world to see. Its has been proven by hacker that walked in the police  department with private conversation I had with somebody else. Not that I have anything to worry about or anything criminal but just note to self this is not as private as you might think.
My messenger is slowing down the phone now
ü§´........&Mucho Amor ‚òÑÔ∏è
Why does it constantly tell me to turn on notifications every time I go to use it? If I wanted to turn it on and be woken up all night I would turn it on.
Use it all of the time.
It's fast and easy. Thank youüòÜ!
I tried to load app, put in my phone number and it said it would text me a code. Tried multiple times to have code resent the it blocked me! I have grandson in South Korea and this is only way to keep in touch!

the most buggiest app i‚Äôve ever had. even with all the updates it‚Äôs still continuously buggy and crashes a lot

Someone hacked my account last night. Not good, very embarrassing A fake video message sent to my friends
Please stop asking me to review stuff
Me gusta mucho la recomiendo
Inconsistent with payments system
its  very  amazing  app
All good but needs longer voice messages.
Why is this separate from the Facebook app? So extra
I'm able to accomplish many things in messenger. Fast and prompt way to connect with those I work with in the music industry!!!  -Todd 
This app really helps talk to my friends when I don't have their contacts in my phone and it also allows me to use filters while I'm video chatting with my bros
My experience with messenger is perfect such a good way to make convos
I enjoy using messenger no problemd
Very good.Thank u.
Couldn‚Äôt open on my iPhone. It came up in a blink and disappear. Even I reinstalled the app, but still the same. Anyone has this type of issue? Or know how to fix?
There needs to be an easier way to delete messages. Not this one single message at a time usto be so easy.
Apple Watch app doesn‚Äôt load at all.
Why let others know I‚Äôm on Facebook or messenger
I do not use book face much anymore since they spawned Messenger.  I only get on it maybe once a week.    Do not care to post what I had for my last meal, take selfies or share crap from someone I really do not know.   I sure has heck am smart and intelligent not to use book face as the delivery mechanism to get the real and truthful news.    So all the snowflakes and minds full of mush need not post other reviews because they r upset because their safe space of fake news has been insulted.
Such a waste of time and to all the people saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt download it ‚Äú FB gives you no choice because you can‚Äôt see your messages otherwise and they‚Äôre usually just announcements that someone joined messenger. Have no idea what benefits there are except to waste time and cause aggravation. I‚Äôve lost business over this crap. And I‚Äôm only giving it one star because it won‚Äôt let me post otherwise. Hate using Facebook now because I hate being manipulated.
FB Messager does not load on Apple Watch Series 3 watchOS 4.2.2. Just shows spinning dots on screen.
This morning I saw there was a dot next to the app icon which I thought was indicating I had a new message, but when I opened the app, there was nothing new there. I then received an on screen message asking if I wanted to log back in. I immediately deleted the app and reinstalled. This happened to me on Facebook yesterday and that app said there was "suspicious" activity on my account and I was locked out which then forced me to change my password. What is going on??
The messenger app work good on the iPhone but has A killer bug on the Apple Watch where it just keeps loading I‚Äôve tried deleting it and restarting both my phone and watch and nothing this needs to be fix
Why would you make it so that the person whose message I deleted is still at the top of messenger with the latest time they sent me a message and everything. I don‚Äôt want them there. You guys make this app worse and worse with every update. It‚Äôs already bad enough that ads pop up in the middle of videos I‚Äôm watching and now this?
Verry good
Messenger is good for chatting and connecting with others. It was all good and with no problems until these recent days. It states to become slower, get suspended sometimes and from time to time when writing, letters come out after finish typing. Hope my review is useful for you guys to take into consideration‚ù§Ô∏è.
Its so sorry that can‚Äôt see the seen mark before open the conversation :)
This is the crappiest app on my phone ! Get it together Facebook!
Add more options so that we can change this rather than being default.
I downloaded the app years ago. The app then deleted itself. Now I can't see Facebook messages on my phone because I don't have Messenger. Mind you, Messenger won't redownload onto my phone. üôÑüòí
Wish I could delete or move the banners with who is online. It‚Äôs just not easy to use.
I've tried installing this app on my iPad twice now and both times it won't go past the setup part before it just freezes and does nothing. Maybe my device is just too old, but I call this a fail. So, I can't check my FB messages from my iPad. Frustrating.
Love using this so quick and easy. I‚Äôm able to send short quick notes. Love it.
I like how you can change the thumbs up it‚Äôs awesome but I hate there‚Äôs like only 2 animals and the rest are just animal faces add more all kinds please thanks have a nice day
Said not enough funds for update???
Why the messenger always updating 1 -3 times a week it‚Äôs frustrating fix please
I love  messager. Thanks for adding this to Facebook
you always say you bring regular updates to fix things and make it better, but you never say what your fixing, and the workers in my company wonder why i had ALL facebook and related ip addresses server and router blocked.
Lo e usado desde el 2011 y estamos en el 2018 y lo sigo usando sin ning√∫n problema üî•
Nice app however there are no privacy settings. password or touch I'd there is nothing. Nothing to keep snooping boyfriends and girlfriends away.
I don‚Äôt like the update because I‚Äôm trying to video chat and it cuts me off this is really pissing me off
I think it is ridiculous that we have to hold down conversations one by one to delete them all. No reason why you can‚Äôt give us the ability to do a edit, check boxes then delete for messages in messenger. I truly believe you are trying to be mosey and keep our messages. I scrolled all the way down and found messages since I joined in 2009. In almost 10 years you can‚Äôt figure out how to add it, or you want to nose into our business. You make all these changes but can‚Äôt do this one.   Once I have them all removed which sadly will take me days, I will delete this app. 
When I tag someone by typing their name in comment section on a post, it automatically gets sent via messenger. How do I stop that from happening? This only started happening about a month ago. Normally their name just stays in the comment section and the see it in their FB notifications.
Love being able to send private messages to family and friends!
üëçüëçüëçüëç
I love this app. Never have any problems. I can connect with so many friends. Clear calls and all
horrible your app is garbage
When will new notification sounds be added? Is sad that after all these years the same silly "ding" sound is the only sound available, meanwhile the Android app is enjoying a much better treatment.
Ever since I got the update I haven‚Äôt been able to call anyone on messanger video chat or just regular calling even when both me and the person I‚Äôm calling are in great service or wifi the call just keeps hanging up as soon as I pick up And both parties have great service. Please please fix this I miss talking to my family back in the states. 
It's annoying.
It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt download???...
Problem is call failed
I‚Äôve been having trouble with this app for a while now it‚Äôs getting very annoying! I reinstalled it and it keeps popping up really old conversations and it‚Äôs not showing my new ones please fix !! ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Amazing üëåüèª
It is impossible to have the Facebook app and not have this stupid Facebook messenger without having that little red message icon up in the top right. Frustrating.
I agree with Adam32k I am an older person and I have really been upset trying to get back my account! It said it had been disabled and I can‚Äôt find out why! I know of no reason it should have been to begin with! Lately I can understand because I keep trying to make a new account and like Adams it keeps coming up disabled! You need to create a number for ppl to call when these things happen! We have aright to know why it was deleted!
Our company decided to rebrand. And instead of keeping our followers. They have decided we can‚Äôt. Even after appealing! It is ridiculous. Now we have to start all over again.  ONE STAR FOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT!!
Update 2/7/18:  now ads in messenger. Why why why why why why why. Eff you Facebook  Every time this app is updated, they bulk it up with more features.  The stickers are useless (the emoji keyboard provides enough faces). There needs to be a way to get rid of that smiley face in the text box. It takes up valuable room on a mobile device and the space above it is unavailable for wrapping text.  Also wish they fixed the friend availability time accuracy. 
gh
So over all this App is great. BUT NEEDS something I think everyone would love. Messenger needs a ‚ÄúDelete All Message‚Äù button or something. I know I am not the only one that hates having to delete one message at a time!!! If Facebook were to add this feature I would give it 5 stars. But other then that it is still a great app.
Omg the latest updates have been a royal headache, with so many unwanted strangers requests
I can‚Äôt see if a message was sent, read or delivered when viewing my contact list. It‚Äôs incredibly inconvenient since I have to individually select each contact to see if a message was even sent. Another problem is a persistent bug which shows a call is on speaker when it isn‚Äôt every time I make or receive a call (audio or video). When this happens, I have to turn speaker off then back on, which is an unnecessary and annoying extra step. I would like to see these issues fixed soon as they get in the way of my (previously satisfied) experience with Messenger.
I like messenger no bad experience yet & I hope I don‚Äôt
Ujiie
Well now not only can‚Äôt I use FB app but, after an update yesterday I can‚Äôt use messenger either. Y‚Äôall really need to fix these issues!!!!  Sent above a few days ago. Just had another messenger update and I still can‚Äôt open messenger or FB and both icons are not on my phone. Y‚Äôall REALLY need to fix this issue!!!! 
Tooooooooooo many updates  ! Really annoying!!!!!! 
Please remove the badge notification that tells me to turn on notifications. I really don't want to turn on notifications, please.
I hate that we have to download an app just to see our messages from Facebook.
I can‚Äôt hear my friend but she can hear me I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the problem
Can Facebook release a "messenger" app that is just for messaging? Tired of all the junk added every week without the option to disable.
Add delete option for multiple conversations
Always ALWAYS asking if I want to turn on notifications. How many times do I have to say NO!!!!! ü§¨
ŸÜÿ™ŸÖŸÜŸâ ÿπŸÑŸäŸÉŸÖ ÿ≤ŸäÿßÿØÿ© ŸàŸÇÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÅÿØŸäŸà ÿ•ŸÑŸâ Ÿ°Ÿ¢Ÿ† ÿ´ÿßŸÜŸäÿ© .. ŸÖÿπ ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÇÿØŸäÿ±
We need to be able to turn off and on, messenger status. It‚Äôs not always that we want to be seen online even if we are online. We Should be able to receive messages with our friends seeing us offline with no last seen. Fix that.
Give me back the little bubble that shows when the message is delivered then changes to their profile picture when read. I hate having to click back into the message to see. It‚Äôs annoying.
I was trying to be good and updated my apps. So frustrated about how they changed the main screen. I don‚Äôt have the bubbles on the right anymore showing if my friend saw my message yet. Just annoying to have to take the second step and click on their name and then back to main screen. Makes me just want to text.
I had to leave Messenger because I received a completely unsolicited pornographic picture. I could find no way to delete it or the person I feel certain was hacked.
They put an Ad right in the middle of the Inbox. It‚Äôs 1/3 the size of my iPhone6+ screen, ridiculous.
I can‚Äôt see my photo from the past glitch every time when I go to Facebook messenger. During my convo with friends still exist picture and photo old school can‚Äôt see on my history chat fix it!!!!!!!!!
More hackers are making themselves available in messenger lately by posting videos under people‚Äôs names & accounts. Twice in the last few weeks has my account fell victim to them. It is very disappointing & disturbing for this to be a constant issue. Privacy isn‚Äôt private anymore as you find many ‚Äúfollowers‚Äù who can obtain your information and a lot of them are people you have never heard of or even know. When you attempt to block these people you find their accounts are bogus!! FB needs to be aware of this and retaliate with actions as some of these videos made are vulgar and not appropriate making the victims feel as their accounts & lives have been ‚Äúraped‚Äù. Not a good positive vibe!
Please fix this ASAP. Whenever I clicked on one of my friend's names in messenger, I would scroll down to see every image we've sent each other. Currently, that is not showing up, instead just showing the menu that pops up after clicking their name with no option to scroll farther down the page. I am begging you to fix this as quickly as possible, thank you.
What the hell it slow down my phone......I can‚Äôt understand what going on
You cannot hide yourself being active anymore? Or am I looking in all of the wrong places. Delete
So lag while using it. Slow and hard to do anything.
It was fine before. Why do we need 3 useless tabs?
My acct. was hacked through messenger. So upset about this!
I‚Äôm not really sure what‚Äôs happening. It‚Äôs stuck on reconnecting and it‚Äôs been stuck on reconnecting for days. Please, fix this!!
Not very happy that my messenger WILL not work on my Apple Watch. I‚Äôve deleted/redownloaded the app and tried different tricks but it does not work. Smh
When i video chat someone i can hear them but they cant hear me ..
I'm really happy with the app. It helps me know where my friends and family are going. I don't know what you guys are talking about, 1 STAR?!?!
This app is invasive, it has its fingers in everything that you hold close in your private life. We could easily have a messenger alternative that doesn‚Äôt monotone your personal info.   Let‚Äôs make the move people. 
Sometimes the keyboard covers the search bar and I can‚Äôt see what am I typing.  Fix it as soon as possible! This is an iPhone X user, and such a bug is a catastrophe for us. 
I downloaded this and have NEVER been able to find and read a message that was sent to me.  First I get a email notification that a message was sent, then I can‚Äôt find it anywhere. I can‚Äôt find it on the messenger app or face book. Don‚Äôt waste the space on your computer. It just a thing to clutter up things. I am not sure what, if any advantages it was suppose to have. Worthless time waster.  Sorry to be so negative but my time is valuable
I know this is an old complaint but i still dont like the fact i have to have an app just to view PM and when i install the app it constantly bugs me to turn on notifications. Let me turn off notifications and not get constantly bugged about it and if you are going to break messenger off to its own app then let me turn off the notifications in the facebook app or the ability to have people send me messages in facebook. I dont use Facebook messenger because it junk compared to all other messenger services and i need a hole through my head more than i need another messaging app.
I don't like this new update, because the photo feature doesn't have very many options to edit or change photos
Im starting to see fraudulent groups created in my name an have no easy way to report them. Messenger is under Facebook but getting any support is impossible
Apple watch app is just simply not working. Nice job!!
I am enjoying the new Messenger! Thanks!
You show I have a message, but it‚Äôs not a message. It‚Äôs an alert from the program urging me to ‚Äúwave‚Äù to a friend. There is no way to stop this, delete these ‚Äúmessages‚Äù or ignore them.
I use this app to contact ppl more than i use my regular text or call on my phone its a pretty good app. Keep up the good work üëç
There is never any information on what was actually updated when there is a new release. I want to know what was updated and why should I download it. Now you get pop ups every few seconds saying to install the new messenger without being given any other information what the change is. Also, a few weeks ago there are now promotional ads in messenger so now you are being bombarded with ads in messenger too.
Idk what you did but only about 1/4 of my messages are delivered. I use messager to text my boys about their father who is in the hospital and 90% of the time, they don‚Äôt get delivered!! It gets very annoying and frustrated. Fix it!!!
I keep getting banned from FB which locks me out of messenger. If you‚Äôre going to separate the apps, separate the ban. App deleted.
Stop trying to do everything. Stick to the basics of messages emojis and gifs.
For some reason...I can only use fb messenger With WiFi. I have no problems with any of my other apps. Please fix this 
It‚Äôs started today but my iPad Pro and other Android phone that has FB Messenger also is notifying me of a new message, I‚Äôve rest my phone, WiFi and restarted my phone and also closed out messenger 2-3 times and won‚Äôt let me receive the new messages. The app is up to date and so is my iOS and I have a iPhone 7plus. So it‚Äôs nothing on my end as to why my messages aren‚Äôt updated and receiving new messages and the rest of my devices are. It seems to need a update because somethings wrong with my messenger receiving new messages and I‚Äôm pretty intelligent with electronics and how to do the simple fixes. What‚Äôs up Apple? I‚Äôm about done with Apple and all the aggravation with phone issues, probably am leaning back towards getting a new Galaxy and sell this one. I don‚Äôt enjoy having issues with something with the phones or apps. Fix the issue please or I‚Äôm headed back to Microsoft
It won‚Äôt let me confirm my number , it always has an error so I can‚Äôt see any off my messages !!!!
I have the 151.0 version and I am disappointed. You can‚Äôt go to the active and see messages and active and turn off the active like before. Would love for this to be fix I don‚Äôt know why the issue is there.
How hard is to to get it together it worked all fine a few weeks ago now on my tablet messages to my personal page and business page wont load i just get an error message but funny enough it works on my phone yet they are both on the same operating system and both completely updates i even tryed that stupid delete an reinstall crao that never works
NEVER update messenger until the one after the new update comes out, new updates are always buggy. I wish everyone would read the Facebook Terms of Service, people wonder how Facebook nails the ads, read there TOS, and then you will know how your info is exploited. Facebook has a license to legally take way more info than you need to open a bank account. Please read there TOS, it shouldn't be legal but nobody reads it and your agreeing to some crazy stuff. So much more invasive and dangerous than any other website or app on the internet. #FBBoycott. 
Add a few more options to like a comment in messenger such as more emojis with different emotions.  Something that lets the person know it‚Äôs cool without using a stupid thumbs up
ŸÑÿØŸä ŸÖÿ¥ŸÉŸÑŸá ŸÅŸä ÿπÿØŸÖ ÿ∂ŸáŸàÿ± ÿµŸàÿ± ÿßÿµÿØŸÇÿßÿ¶Ÿä ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿØÿ±ÿØÿ¥Ÿá ÿµŸàÿ± ÿßŸÑÿµŸÅÿ≠Ÿá ÿßŸÑÿ¥ÿÆÿµŸäŸá
Stupidest notification on my phone. Please make it possible to turn this garbage off. I can‚Äôt hardly find real messages for sifting between this crap and the spam/ads.. please let me pay a dollar or two to turn those off. Ruins the whole app experience!
I mean I am enjoying messenger it was a lot of fun because I get to Connect with Friends and family here's my contact info.I am enjoying messenger. It is a folder on. It is a folder on your feet is it here Vitas get here Vitas did. Vitas VSS
Very good program. Fantastic
With the new update, when I video call on fb messenger, the receivers phone does not ring even when they‚Äôre in the app. Will change rating when fixed.
Can we please get a chat heads option like android!!!!
It would be a good social media app, talking to all your friends. But, but, but, but the fact that you can‚Äôt just message on Facebook is terrible the fact that most of the time messages don‚Äôt send is terrible and most of the features are useless. Thanks for making this mediocre messaging app for no reason!
Loading bar spins forever
It‚Äôs good tbh but it won‚Äôt let me go back to pictures and my friends have sent some VERY good memes
I‚Äôm playing pool with different ppl & the game must have a glitch or a virus. It doesn‚Äôt let me or the ppl I play play our turn. It kicks us out. 1 of my games is stuck.  I actually really like this game but am not able to play it at all now bc of the problems... 
It‚Äôs fun to edit pictures in the app, but zooming disappeared. Bring it back!
Why are you making this app worst with every update? If you adding new features and can't keep the app stable then just remove them and keep this app usable!!
When uploading multiple high mb photos and/or videos it crashes every single time. The worst part? They know about it and fail to fix it.
To the developers of this App, please fix this one issue that literally drives me nuts. Make it possible so that the name of the person sending the message can be seen and not the name and preview. Current option right now is to turn of the ‚Äòmessage preview‚Äô feature but it also turns off the notification of the name of the sender. So when a message comes through, it only says ‚ÄòNotification‚Äô but does not show the name unless you actually open the app. It‚Äôs annoying coz sometimes you just want to know who‚Äôs sending the message without having to open the app to find out. Please fix this issue. I‚Äôm using the iPhone 8 Plus, iOS 11.2.5
Hey Facebook this app is too loaded and too much is going on! If you want an app for just messaging than let it be ! But forcing people into downloading it it‚Äôs not cool
Latest update causes false notifications on iPhone.
I have had messenger for a long time. It has recently stopped working. I have tried many times to delete and reinstall but still does not work
The last couple days it has been freezing up and I have to uninstall it and then reinstall it. It will do the same thing again.
This app is functional, but it is cumbersome and frustrating to use. In particular the process of choosing a recipient is annoying because I can‚Äôt figure out how to choose recipients before writing the message.  And the app‚Äôs unwavering insistence that I enable notifications is insulting and infuriating. And the app also continues to disrespectfully suggest things I don‚Äôt want like sharing my contacts.
The Application is so pushy. As in it tries to bully you into turning everything on, allowing notifications. I feel like the App is trying to Automate my life. I personally do not appreciate it.
Easy,no hassle and free
ads, promoted features nobody needs, crapy implementation
The app works well on my iPhone 6S, but I just wish it would work as well and as dedicatedly on my watch so I can truly just communicate through my Apple Watch gen 2.
My messenger emojis disappeared awhile ago and I‚Äôve been stuck using the iPhone emojis since. There was no reason to remove them so bring them back. What‚Äôs the point of making emojis for everyone to see the same thing but you take them away for half of the users?
Very annoying.
Pink_grapefruit
Steals and sell all you information I never had spam before I stated using this
Still don‚Äôt have the option to mass delete messages
Stop with the continuous demand to have my contacts..
Can‚Äôt even open the app at all
Like I said I USED TO love messenger. I used it everyday all day. But lately it hasn‚Äôt been working. I open it and I MIGHT be able to read a message someone sent me if it‚Äôs short enough then it ends up turning black and kicking me out of the app to my home screen on my phone. I‚Äôm really tired of this and I can‚Äôt even report the issue because it won‚Äôt let me keep the app open long enough to report it. Fix this issue or I‚Äôm deleting my Facebook for good. ‚úåüèºüíØüò°
Getting assaulted by hundreds of people when all I want to talk to is One! Not OK!
People can see on your home page if your live or not and it‚Äôs time stamped. Turning off the chat doesn‚Äôt work etc. FB go back to how it was!
Every 30 seconds on the app I get a pop up to turn on notifications. I do not want them on. It‚Äôs driving me crazy. It has been like this for over a year now. Is there not an option to not see that pop up again?
Ever since the new update now my Apple Watch series 3 doesn‚Äôt work with the messenger app thanks a lot ‚òπÔ∏è
Owner is certainly scaring off any patron that does not agree with his agenda.... young fool will be out of business soon.  Just like his predecessors!...
Generally, I love this app and use it daily, but since the last mobile update it is not functional. None of my messages are viewable and I cannot contact anyone. Please fix this bug ASAP, and I‚Äôll happily raise my star rating.
FFS THERE IS NO OPTION TO SILENCE THE OBNOXIOUS SOUND FX FOR THE MESSENGER APP. We can turn off the sounds for FB proper but for iOS we have no option to turn off the stupid af noises?
I tried connecting my Apple Watch and it just loads and loads and loads..
Constantly whenever im in a call if i try to do anything my phone screen goes black then back on constantly it stops me from doing anything for the love of god please fix it. Im on iphone 6s and my friend who has a samsung doesnt seem to have this issue.
Useless crapy app!!!! There million of cases on the apple watch are you guys so dumb enough not to fix this issue geez
It‚Äôs a cool app
I cant use my messenger app and have other apps run at the same time. At first, it was just one other app that couldn‚Äôt run with Messenger open. Now, it doesn't matter what app it is; none will work as long as I try to use both. Messenger runs fine, but what is the point of it if I cant socialize with it?
Good job thanks great job also
Why can‚Äôt I send iPhone voice memos in messenger? It shows connection lost when I try to send it, even though connection is all okay.üò≠üò≠
I received an update for Messenger two days and when it try to download it, nothing happens. I‚Äôve had the same problem with Facebook too. Any suggestions?? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Can‚Äôt turn off the chat with the new update
I‚Äôve used messenger for years now, never had a problem until this recent update. When I receive videos that friends/family have recorded and sent to me it has no sound at all. I‚Äôve uninstalled and reinstalled messenger, checked my settings to see if it‚Äôs on the allow list. Everything is good on my end and my senders end. Just messenger seems to not want to allow audio for me.
this app uses too much resources downloading pictures and videos even if it is in background or even if it is not open. release the lite version for IOS!
ŸÖŸàÿ≠ÿ≠ÿ≠
Inactive Button turned off and people still see you why? 
Every time I try to open my messenger it crashes and I try to reopen it crashes again and third time I have to wait like two minutes for it to start working again! I have iPhone SE, has been like this a couple of weeks. It‚Äôs very frustrating.
Worst thing that happened to Facebook  why is it that you can not have this app installed or use it ever and it still allows people to send you messages without informing your Facebook friends that you won‚Äôt receive the message?
Hii, i dont know how to switch to offline on this version
This app causes viruses and I want it removed from my cloud how can I do that I will never use this ever
I‚Äôve had at least 6 messages from the Messenger app today, telling me to ‚ÄúUpload your contacts to connect with your friends on Messenger‚Äù. I don‚Äôt want to sync ALL of my phone contacts with Messenger! What part of NO is your problem? I‚Äôm going to delete the app altogether if the harassment doesn‚Äôt stop.
I run a business and would really like to be able to delete a bunch of messages at once!
I love this app however I‚Äôm constantly missing calls. I checked my setting and everything is on how it‚Äôs supposed to be. I get messages but I‚Äôm just missing calls.
it‚Äôs really pointless they PUSH you turning on your notifications. everytime I open the app. so annoying.
It didn‚Äôt show available person easily and also we can‚Äôt turn off online status  Which was better in previous version 
This is the only app that doesn‚Äôt work on my generation 3 Apple Watch, and i know it‚Äôs the app‚Äôs problem because I just spent an hour with Apple customer support trying to fix it. It doesn‚Äôt load at all.
I use messenger all the time and I love it, but I have some news for you Facebook. The default ding notification sound is awful. Can we get some other option up in here? It would be appreciated.
The two newest updates are lousy. Go back to being able to see who‚Äôs active without showing all of a persons groups.
They should really do something about the viruses I got hacked and can't get into my account
I hate that i cant log in and out of messenger... I hate that messenger notifies everyone immediately when i log into Facebook. I want to be able to control this feature. 
This app doesn't work with the series 3 watch. üñï
I have tried to send a PDF file that I have on my email directly to Messenger but it just wouldn‚Äôt work! Such a pain!!! It‚Äôs always prompting me to check my connection, I have a strong WiFi at home, what the hell is going on with this crappy app? üôÑüôÑüôÑ 
Updates so often u can‚Äôt just view a message.   You need to upgrade it before you can see message.   A message app should not need this many updates.  It is completely stupid
If the icon is activated outside of the application, it is possible to surf Facebook and talk on Messenger together and at the same time as Samsung devices
Facebook Messenger should not be connected with Facebook. It‚Äôs a terribly clunky messenger platform. The only reason I have it on my iPhone is to get rid of the pesky lightning bolt notification that pops up on Facebook. PLEASE disconnect this from FB and make it a separate app so I can finally be rid of it! ANNOYING!!
I like penis
It‚Äôs ok, I would prefer if I could log out on the app, so it‚Äôs not always available for my kids to get into or if I don‚Äôt want alerts. I know I can turn alerts off, but I would prefer to just log out.
Which is best? Email? Text? Or Messenger?  Many ways to recieve community. Makes no difference. They all work for me ......
On my iPhone only I can‚Äôt seem to see a list of active people. I can in my iPad version and very happy about that. New iPad version brought the same horrible update. Really don‚Äôt like it now! 
It‚Äôs hopeless to try and keep a fb safe and secure my husband hacks my fb, messenger and what ever else because the info about the creation of the website are public information the ‚Äúcodes‚Äù as he put it now I just don‚Äôt care anymore I can‚Äôt keep anyone out that wants in they don‚Äôt need much to get in it‚Äôs sad but gotta roll with the punches I have learned so ya... good luck all & don‚Äôt add people that u don‚Äôt trust fully....
Messenger makes it easier and quicker to connect with friends and families because they are members of messenger.
I delete the photos in the conversation but it appears on shared photo section why I can‚Äôt delete that photos on photos shared I want to delete it
The last few days since I did a FB Messenger update it has been problematic.  It freezes and doesn‚Äôt update conversations.  It doesn‚Äôt give me notifications.
ME ENCANTA ESTE MEDIO DE COMUNICACI√ìN !
Where is the privacy on messenger???
Why I can't offline messenger please add offline
Please bring back the little bubbles next to their names that show whether a message has been sent, delivered, or they‚Äôve viewed it. I HATE having to open a conversation to see it.
If I post a video, I don‚Äôt know if other people can hear it because audio on or not, no sound comes out.
I wish I can delete the app, it‚Äôs annoying and unnecessary
Great app to communicate with others!
Can‚Äôt call out to certain people
Really works great sending pics is so easy and like it as well or better then text. Easy way to contact people selling and buying items.
Forced to use messenger, for a messaging app it takes up a huge amount of space uses a tremendous amount of data and active memory. It runs on and off disrupting other applications it opens by itself. it heats up my device when it runs it‚Äôs transferring lots of data. I can‚Äôt imagine why- I cannot see what it reason it would be transmitting data copious amounts of data. This means when I have to use the app, I install it and use it, and when I am done, I have to uninstall it every time.
Messenger provides a great opportunity to keep in touch with family and friends especially over the seas. I know that are other apps and so forth, but I like this one the best, due to good connection and clarity most of the time, and other positive reasons.
More often then not, FACEBOOK MESSENGER ( when I‚Äôm typing a message,) my keypad is lost and won‚Äôt come back unless I log out of FACEBOOK MESSENGER and log back in. And my messenger is up to date. AND TO BOOT! ... It only happens with my FACEBOOK MESSENGER, I‚Äôve also been having issues with FACEBOOK itself and my FACEBOOK IS up to date. And so are my devices up to date...  ...Now I ask you: What‚Äôs up with that? :/ 
Fix it. Hacked account, annoying chain messages. Y‚Äôall gotta go better.
My phone network went down. And a friend run up on me and I shared with her how I have missed all my business calls and conferences. So she tells me through WiFi I can use messenger as a I phone and not only that I can have a conference with multiple of people over video at one time.
I really enjoyed using messenger until I realized that some of my pictures delete when I delete a thread and others don‚Äôt.   It seems to be very random as to which ones won‚Äôt delete.
There‚Äôs not a button to turn chat on/off anymore
All the sudden my phone will ring and it will be some guy I‚Äôve never met trying to video call me because he‚Äôs seen my photo somewhere in Africa. I like that we have the call option but I should have the option of turning off calls from strangers who are not on my friend list
It bothers me whenever there‚Äôs already a service like text messaging that works fine and another company tries to force you to download and use their products..   I use FB Messenger only when I have to but for nothing I want totally private.. 
Facebook has made an even easier way to stay connected to your friends.
It is not only  helpful but also powerful! I am really enjoying and love it!  Joshua Hlawnmual Indianapolis,IN

New update is crashing when I open a feed
All of this new technology amazes me,  i can not believe that I can sit in my living  room in the US and chat with my friends in Africa.  One of my sons lives in Australia  and while I was sitting in the "cell" lot at the airport in Tampa I received a Facetime call from my son in Australia.  Our world is so much smaller because of all these wonderful, entertaining apps you talented people have created for all of us to share.  FREE,   Thank you a million times over.  They have made life so much happier and broadened our world.   F R E E ,
Your error is too long time today! It‚Äôs a social media application So,you should not take careless this error too long time :) 
Love it. Great app. Makes the most out of my time.
There was a video on here that someone posted of a little girl about 7 years old giving Flachio to a grown my and it just made me sick to my stomach
More chat color options would be nice. Maybe a color spectrum so we can make our own color.
Like being able to keep in contact with all my friends and relatves who are near or far away on Facebook Messenger.
except the adds, please remove comerciales. thank u
The app is GREAT AND unbeatable!!!
They are no longer there now i have to open each message to see if its been read or not.
Wish this didn't have to be separate from the actual Facebook app. I have to download and delete this off and on because of how much storage the Facebook apps take up on my phone. It probably won't ever change, but it's really disappointing anyways.
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a bug or by design but for whatever reason when I am trying to upload pictures to Facebook messenger the menu does not allow me to choose anything except my camera roll and some predefined albums.  why!???

Full of annoying ads just like facebook now. üò†
If you cannot turn off the read/seen function, I will never open the app again. Ever.
It‚Äôs OK. It‚Äôs kind of annoying that in order to get your messages you have to have a great signal or be connected to Wi-Fi before you can connect to the Internet and get your messages.
There‚Äôs been so many problems seems October it‚Äôs bull crap
I don‚Äôt like the ads at all
Use messenger all the time but hate it showing that I'm active and I turn it off for it to turn on by itself . Really wish there was a way to mute conversations with a person . Like a do not disturb me button where they can message all they want but you don't have to see it or get notified and you can even check it without it saying you read it.
Does what it says it's supposed to do. Works as advertised. I like the stickers and gif features. I also like the video chat, with the filters kind of like snapchat in a way. I have FaceTime on my iPhone and Skype, yet I always use the Facebook messenger video chat feature instead. The app quality is great as well. Another cool feature is being able to send money. Overall it's a great messenger app. I use it more than any other messenger app I have, including the default texting app. Keep up the good work Mark Zuckerberg! 5 stars!
I love it
Can you please give us a logout option and bring back the messenger deactivation feature? Thanks
Enjoy it most of the time üòÄ
Why is it so hard to delete Contacts off messenger that you inadvertently synced to the app? It makes no sense that I can‚Äôt go in and either delete or reverse my mistake. And again NOT THE CONVERSATION THE ‚ÄúCONTACT‚Äù
All audio recording apps must be blocked from sharing recorded clips.  I have used multiple apps and when I click the share button and choose Messenger, there is no image of the file I send like before, when I choose my recipients and click send, it tells me to check my connection.  Need this fixed please.
Working the dream takes a lot of grinding
End of story. Tried reinstalling and no luck. Googled several websites for suggestions... most suggest editing Apple Watch settings in the app, but there are none! Facebook must have removed them. A total dud.
The interface for this app is so focused on lists it fails to grasp my focus.
üòÄüëçüèΩ
Is good.
It works smooth on my IPhone SE.
Fix audio for phone calls.
This app keep asking me to turn on my notifications. How many times do I need to say no? This is aggravating and  I remember why I uninstalled itü§¨
Amazing
It‚Äôs a very nice app, but I think it has some issues that should be fixed to make it better, like when I upload a video to my day it has a lot less of quality.
I do not like the change and can‚Äôt turn off when I don‚Äôt want to be available
Quick way to keep in touch.
Pretty efficient!LOVE the GIFS‚Äô
I minimize my use of messenger because I don‚Äôt like obnoxious ads clogging my messages. Bad call FB.
I do not want adds  my messenger. Now that Facebook put adds on messenger, I don‚Äôt want this garbage service.
What‚Äôs with the ads!? Ads in my message stream .. forget it! Time to switch.
Tiene 4 d√≠as que al ver a la otra persona todo sale al rev√©s y no se ven bien a los lados tiene un problema muy grave üò§
Although, sometimes attachments and shared content from Facebook do not get pushed through to the recipient (even when the app says it does).  Other than sharing content straight from Facebook, I use it more than my native text messaging app due to the fact that read receipts are basically always on and I believe that promotes better communication. 
Cool
...to respond to memes, etc. Or maybe just operator error! üòÜ
I want to be able to erase messages ease. And he backspace

Is annoying
I don't like being forced to use You were messenger approve the app or program it's annoying I don't like having another having to have another out to you so it should be a better back into Facebook I am not happy at all and most likely looking for options to move away from Facebook.
One star due to useless update summary and massive bloat.
I never know how to ask a question about the Messenger system and you don‚Äôt make it easy
I love messenger but wish there was more cooler things to do with it. Colors, make the bubble chats different with shape or something different messaging tones would be nice.
I talk to my family overseas all the time using messenger app. It‚Äôs the best ever clear voice and video. Thank u for creating such app.
Great app
Kinda annoying to delete each conversation one by one. Pls, create wherein u can delete the whole without going in each line! Maybe make it easier to delete like right and left click only! Just a suggestion.
Make it
On Apple Watch Series 2: It‚Äôs either asking me to sign in on the iPhone or just loading endlessly. Sometimes when something shows up it shows messages from days ago.
It‚Äôs often nice to make a quietly private connection w a friend, family, or a group!
This is very good way to keep in touch with your loved ones and close friends.
Worst app that ever existed.  Does nothing but annoy you until you‚Äôre forced to use the web portal. 
I also like the ability to go between online and offline and that feature has seemed to disappear today....
El VM M
This app has literally saved my life and continues to benefit me in more ways than anyone can imagine. Thank you to all the powers that be to make this safe and user friendly everyday I trust to use it!
Messenger Beats Chat by A Mile! Send Pics, See Your Friends, But, Can Be Spied On, Just Keep It Cool üòé!
Messenger is easily hacked and you never know until someone says hey I think you‚Äôve been hacked. You should be able to log out and change your password instead of switching accounts.
I keep uninstalling Messenger because of the inordinate amount of spoofs and scams
I can't believe I'm getting ads in my messages now. Going to look for an alternative to this app. Really bad design.
Gracias a la aplicaci√≥n de messenger es m√°s f√°cil hablar con amigos y familiares no importa la distancia
Says I have a notification when no one new has messaged me.
I love it!
After new update it‚Äôs not letting me go into my requested messages. Won‚Äôt load. Annoyed.
You can‚Äôt delete a message from the app???? Why is that??? I have to be on my desktop just to delete messages
Love my Messenger!
I hate the new version in order to go offline I need to click on my profile Nd click to be offline. Everything is so different.
Excellent Service
Para responder un mensaje con el iPhone bloqueado, basta con mantener pulsado el mensaje y darle a "responder" una vez echo esto pulso el bot√≥n de enviar y me pide que ingrese el Touch ID para poder enviarlo, todo bien en eso, el problema es que inconscientemente el dispositivo se desbloquea  y as√≠ si no me doy cuenta y lo dejo por ah√≠ cualquiera puede volver a pulsar e ingresar al sistema... Podr√≠a barajarse otra manera de enviar el mensaje sin que el dispositivo se desbloquee por enviarlo.
Great
Have always been pleased with this.
Way too much extra junk. Ads, bots, feeds - all distract from the actual purpose of the messenger.
This app is useless on the Apple Watch.
Great
Deleted this app today because the constant pop up ‚ÄúPlease Turn on Notifications.‚Äù I purposely went into my settings and turned off notifications and the app won‚Äôt stop the constant begging. Using Instagram DM instead
No complaints or criticisms. However, when possible I use my regular text feature on my phone.  Overall I don‚Äôt care for it. 
Facebook messenger is fine, but I can‚Äôt export voice memos. Every time I try, I get a message that says ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt send. Check your connection and try again.‚Äù I‚Äôve contacted Apple support and they think there‚Äôs an issue with the app itself. I‚Äôm starting to think so, too.
My account keeps getting locked out for ‚Äúsuspicious activity‚Äù. I end up having to send facebook a picture to prove I am who I say I am. When I get my account back after a few days it never tells me what the suspicious activity was.  This happens around once a month.  Now I‚Äôm locked out due to ‚Äúsuspicious activity‚Äù once again. But everytime I try to send the image the page refreshes and says that my network isn‚Äôt stable and to connect to a better network. And it also gets rid of the file I selected. I‚Äôve tried changing the file type of the picture. From JPG to PNG I‚Äôve tried uploading different pictures all of me. And of different file types all with no luck. Im not making another Facebook account. I‚Äôve already had to do that once due to losing my phone. It‚Äôs way to much work to re-add all of my friends and family. Plus I‚Äôll probably still have to deal with getting locked out all the time. So I guess I‚Äôm done using Facebook. 
I enjoy messenger. You should too!!

Why am I forced to download and install a bloody App to access a feature I could use perfectly fine before by simply visiting Facebook in Safari?
Great
I honestly love messenger I use it more than I do texting, but all of my friends seem to have those little chat head things and they look really awesome to use. Why don‚Äôt I have those? I‚Äôve searched high and low and just can‚Äôt figure it out. The only possible thing I can think of is because I have an iPhone. However, just because I have an iPhone doesn‚Äôt mean I should not be allowed the little chat head guys.
Don't like the fact that I don't get notifications of messages from people not on my list. But appreciate that I can chat when texting is off line.
New update is horrible. So confusing and annoying. Go back to the old one!
Hi  I really like this app its my favorite app for chatting and calling i dont really use other apps for ( chatting and calling) but i wish if the contacts were more arranged  Because it's really annoying to see a bunch of contacts with a white background and black messages  I hope you agree with me.  With all love Mujtaba. 
not having good video calls
Great
Awesome way to communicate with unlimited number of people at the same time. Great for marketing as well.
This app is complete garbage and unnecessary; users should be able to check their messages in the Facebook app itself. If I want notifications on, I‚Äôll turn them on. This useless app continuously tells me I have a message, but it is just a notification telling me to turn on notifications. NEGATIVE STARS!
We update the app regularly: So you open it, and increase the number of active daily users üòÇ  It‚Äôs a good app overall, but I really hate Facebook‚Äôs desperation to get the number of ‚Äúactive daily users‚Äù up.  I only use messenger because I need to be in touch with those in my life. I don‚Äôt use Facebook. It‚Äôs a joke. Period.   Ps. Enough with the emails about people I don‚Äôt even know!!! 
The messenger so bad is stop working few days and always frizz. Please i need fix
Great app love it for texting video chat lag other than that it's awesome
So, my friend calls me on messenger a good bit and lately I‚Äôve noticed a big problem. If my friend calls me while phone is unlocked the audio almost disappears as if phone volume is low, but I tested it a few times and turned up volume up to max while in the test calls with my friend and it‚Äôs still basically impossible to hear them. Now here‚Äôs the weird part...when the phone is locked the audio works perfectly? Idk if this issue happens to anyone else, but it happens to me. This is on an Iphone 5s if this helps any at all.
I am tired of Facebook and Messenger trying to sync contacts in my phone. This drives me absolutely insane. I made the mistake of accidentally allowing it, it took me 4 hours to go through and delete contacts that I didn‚Äôt need nor want. This might be ideal for some people but I, as well as everyone I talk to about it, despise this ‚Äúfeature‚Äù that is more like a pain in my butt.
I really don‚Äôt like that I need to go to two diff places to check for comments or messages. I hate this app and wish that instead of it notifying me that I have messages usually they are insignificant msgs that it just sent the entire message to me verses sending notifications. I don‚Äôt particularly care to communicate this way bc it is hit and miss with messages. I know ppl use it that don‚Äôt have cellular networks but frankly the messages are always read much later than sent and again don‚Äôt amount to anything significant!
Can we develop a way that we can choose to allow no one to direct message on FB?
It's a pain to have to leave Facebook to write something u don't want on the wall Updated 10 times why? Easier the way it was to message on the FB app What's the reason again? Everyone has unlimited texting so you're saving nobody any money 
Whoever is doing this job on messenger... You guys ROOOOCK!!!
I have many friends living in other countries and this app make it very convenient to contact them. Great app!!  On the other hand, the Apple Watch version of this application falls off the cliff. There is a complete disconnect with the iPhone application and Apple Watch‚Äôs application. The issue happens to be a prolonged loading-gate wheel that will last for days-on-end without the data populating from the phone to the watch. I removed the app from my Apple Watch due to this plaguing inconvenience. Please fix this issue swiftly! Many of your users forum here and on other sites have this similar problem! Consensus suggests that you keep sweeping this issue under the rug. As an app developer, you should repair this service to solidify unit between all devices that uses your app. 
When i want to share a photo from fb to a person on messenger it takes me to the app page... asks me if i want to open the app and i do but I can‚Äôt share he pics
It‚Äôs saying unable to connect to messenger & why is that message ?
Fix the "waiting for connection" bug.

I had someone stalk me and I had to keep blocking them as they kept making new Facebook profiles. This time when I got the messenger request and after profile and message blocking, the request isn‚Äôt going away. They used to work for Verizon and got fired for tampering and stalking other customers. Facebook will not get back to me AT ALL and I need some freaking help with this. It‚Äôs unnerving and there‚Äôs no reason for me not to have been given some assistance. Just being honest here.
I have been trying to play 8-ball Pool through this app as as of 3 days ago I have 4(yes 4!) games I can‚Äôt even access. I just uninstalled and reinstalled messenger and latest update prior to uninstalling and reinstalling did ABSOLUTELY nothing to fix the games issue.
Ever since Facebook updated the messenger app, it removed the option to put your online status offline. Now instead it shows ‚Äúsuggested people‚Äù in the people section and the feature is gone.
Excellent
I was hacked via messenger & caused a lot of trouble. Not interested in using it anymore.
I hate the fact that one can‚Äôt be on Facebook and it shows that you‚Äôre active on messenger!! Like there should be an option whether you want people to know if you‚Äôre active or not..
I downloaded messenger but it will not open.I had it on my last  Apple iPhone 6 but on my new one ( last one  the speaker broke) like I said it won‚Äôt open !üòívery frustrating !
I have going to this shop for o Dr 10 Years! The manager and staff are amazing and I get really excited every time my girls buy my gifts for bday, Mother‚Äôs Day, and Christmas-  I even love to shop there not just for myself but my friends my daughters friends and even teacher gifts!! Great place must shop there for ever occasion you need a gift for the special person in your life:)
Muy buena app! Solo una cosa, ahora con las √∫ltimas actualizaciones ha desaparecido la flechita que dice que si el mensaje se envi√≥, llego y fue le√≠do. No s√© si fue por un cambio voluntario o por error, pero si volviera ser√≠a muy √∫til!
Another update! Tells you that it‚Äôs going to take up lots and lots of space! How can you update this goddamn thing every freaking week and still need another update
Terrible
I have a concern I want to delete someone from messenger and I am not friends on Facebook with them they got in some how...!please tell me how to delete them...
This is an awesome app and works really well. HOWEVER, THERE IS A HACKER SENDING OUT FAKE VIDEOS AND WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT OPEN IT BC THEN YOUR ACCOUNT WILL BE HACKED AND YOUR ACCOUNT WILL FORCEFULLY SEND OUT VIDEOS TO YOUR FRIENDS AND ITLL HACK THEIR ACCOUNT. BE ADVISED!!!
February 2018 update Still awful. It‚Äôs going to be awful until it‚Äôs gone, I think, but it‚Äôs funny that Facebook hasn‚Äôt caught on.  ‚Äî- oh, but maybe they have and they don‚Äôt care‚Äî‚Äî  I just skimmed through a long rant, not review, horrified we have the temerity to complain about the quality of a free app. What that little child or reactionary conservative doesn‚Äôt understand is the damage that attitude has caused too many Americans throughout history... and people are ramping up to do even more.  Nellie Bly investigated the conditions of an ‚Äúinsane asylum‚Äù in the late 1800‚Äôs and a regular retort to the women (and probably the public) about the freezing temperatures, unplayable pianos, inedible food, abusive nurses, housing of perfectly sane women and no compassion for women who were actually ill was ‚Äúwhat do you expect for charity?‚Äù or ‚Äúdo you think you‚Äôre too good for charity?‚Äù. Facebook is no charity though. We‚Äôre the commodity- the product that is sold as the product. If the product isn‚Äôt able to expect ‚Äúworkable conditions‚Äù they have an obligation to stop being the product. It‚Äôs not free though- remember that.    When I began to hear Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs views on privacy, when I learned most people were getting their news through a Facebook filter, that my likes contributed to an algorithim about people like me, when bots and idiotic advertising entered the insane realm of Facebook I was glad I‚Äôd taken a big step back. Sadly though, there‚Äôs a cost to that and something needs to fill it. Early days mailing lists felt a lot safer than this monstrosity.  (Even if an app is free, it should work.)   January 25 (2017) update  I despise this so much that I haven't used Facebook in weeks. I considered it since I wanted to contact some friends but I found other ways even though it took me a long time to figure it out.   Dreadful.  ...... I'm disgusted in principle and by the way it fails to function. Don't force it on people. If you have to, you must think it's as awful as we do or you have some ulterior motive. I used to be fairly casual about privacy concerns but this would set off a lot of alarm bells for almost anyone, especially making it mandatory. That's really juvenile somehow but I can't explain how.  I haven't seen anything as cumbersome and difficult to use as this since the early 1990s. Did somebody reach back into something they designed for class, something that was amazingly cutting-edge for the time and just pop it in here as an app in order to torture us or thinking it was still impressive? This is awful. It's ugly.  It seems to let some kind of random spam/friend requests/garbage come through but I have to request that my friends do this thing instead of just clicking on a little button to say "hey, call me to arrange what time we are meeting". I rarely, if ever rate anything with one star but this is a piece of garbage. Throw it away, make it be just an empty thing so you don't have to deal with Apple and start again. We all have free ways of contacting each other. We don't need this and were happy with what we had. Just go away.

I do not want messages from pages. Get rid of the notifications for it
It‚Äôs bad enough to have to see the stupidest ads on Facebook but messenger too that‚Äôs bull
Facebook has asked me for new passwords every time I try to log in.  How many times do I have to change my password? I am sick of this happening time and time again. I guess I‚Äôll just have to get help another way, however I‚Äôm extremely  disappointed with this site. This has caused me a lot of time and inconvenience and I‚Äôm thinking maybe I should just forget about Facebook and their incompetence. Thanks, Marilyn Kraft 
Why keep ruining a functional app?? Please bring back the ‚Äúread‚Äù indicator on the conversations list page.  It is frustratingly inconvenient without it! 
That's obnoxious.
It cannot make a call in China it notified ‚Äúyour country is not support it‚Äù
I‚Äôve been waiting for so long now. When will we get that feature? And The design is kinda old now especially on iPad. Please make changes!
I like the app and I use it everyday but it would be great if the chat heads were available to use on Apple devices as well. It would be soo much easier and the access to messaging faster would be great while doing other things as well because it is really kinda irritating having to switch out of messenger jst to get to another app and it would be easier to have it right on the same screen. Please bring a chat head to our iPhone screens! Thanks it will be very appreciated!!!
I would too have the chat bubble option for iPhone.
I love this app, but it blinds me at night. Can you please add a dark mode by switching all the blacks to whites, and whites to blacks? But keep the rest the same. Love the shiny color options for the different conversations. Thanks.
I don't want people to be able to contact me AT ALL through messenger. Want to rid completely, disable, and also remove any ability to contact me through it, and tell them that I'm not available through it so there aren't messages going unread thinking I'm ignoring them. Please provide an option for people that cannot stand this and do not want it. Thanks.
Now I cant log in because I have to ‚Äúconfirm identity‚Äù and when I press either button, nothing happens. It tells me to open safari and I do, fb is up, I retry logging in with same endless cycle.  Thank you fb for making reading fb messages a disdainful process.    I use to be able to just use facebook to message people, but now I am required to download this app, which is relentless on me setting up push notifications. Unless I do, I will always be notified to set it up every time I go in, and have a push notification within the app to set it up, which wont go away unless I do.   Its axiomatic that no one likes this app. Its pretty much my least favorite app on my phone. I actually delete it every time I am don't looking at my messages. Then reinstall it later only because I am required to have it to read them. 
I don‚Äôt have a Facebook account so I tried to log in with my phone number i wrote it 100% correctly then it didn‚Äôt send me the code so i kept going out and in then after some tries it blocked me then after about more than 10 mins it send me all the codes then i tried again it was after more than 30 mins from what happened it still told me you are blocked
Why don‚Äôt have khmer language ?
Please update the app so when people update their Facebook profile it also updates in the messenger app as well
*** please add the favorites back to the top of the page. I like seeing who‚Äôs online.  Change it back!!! I liked seeing favorites and active people on the message screen. I don't like it when I have to switch to see who's online. And I don‚Äôt like having to click the message to see if it‚Äôs been seen. Add the icons back to the main page.
Messenger is consistently freezing for minutes at a time when using the app and then switching between other apps. I upgraded to an iPhone 8 +.  Not sure what the deal is. But it‚Äôs super frustrating.
I hope will fix the issue of the volume... sooo dissapointed üíîüíîüíî
Edit: hey you fixed it, nice. Typing on iPad is pain still layout wise but it works.  Messenger usually works well on my iPhone no issues what so ever, in this case for an odd reason it doesn‚Äôt want to type I‚Äôll begin typing ‚ÄúHey I‚Äôm‚Äù and it doesn‚Äôt let me type afterwards. I have no idea why this occurring but I hope I‚Äôm not alone, I use this app to talk to friends and talk about homework and junk‚Äî this is a real pain and honestly a bad move on the team‚Äôs part for not checking before sending this update out. This could‚Äôve honestly been fixed or avoided if they checked this before releasing it, I trust on the team a lot and will always update on day one. You‚Äôre making me regret this honestly, y‚Äôall just giving me trust issues 
Top annoyances: -Editing long messages in the middle: it is hard to select where to start adding text, then it bounces back and forth from location to the bottom.  -Ads are huge.  -Can‚Äôt copy a link that is in a previous message easily  -Sending a message from FB makes it so you have to write the message first, then select the person. Hard to convert to a group. 
Hate the ads within the games. Other than that, great for it‚Äôs actual purpose!! üòé 
I never had a problem with the app till now... I can‚Äôt see any pictures that have been sent on a chat. They just don‚Äôt show up :/
Sorry, 1 star since I can‚Äôt use it! WhatsApp and Viber let us use just a phone number
Before the update I could read messages without unlocking the phone now it just says ‚ÄúJoe sent you a message‚Äù do not appreciate, would like to go back.
I love this app and I use it as my texting app for most people, but can you guys PLEASE make a way for it not to prompt me to add all my contacts and my phone number EVERY TIME I open the app!! I didn‚Äôt just install it, I have had it for YEARS. Please put a ‚Äúno I don‚Äôt want to do this‚Äù option instead of ‚Äúnot now‚Äù. It makes me not want to use it anymore. I do not want my contacts from my phon synced with my Facebook AT ALL.
Pls fix the lagging / screen freeze issues
Messenger app is fine, but I don't want to waste storage on an app that should be part of the main facebook app. It's lazy and  another way to waste time trying to figure out facebook. What a dumb decision.
I hate the fact that I‚Äôm being forced to turn on the notifications. I don‚Äôt want to turn on the notifications, but sending me an alert every few seconds asking me if I want to turn on the notifications is just ridiculous. If I want to turn on the notifications, I will do it myself when and if I want it.
There is literally no point in having a messaging app that does not deliver your messages at the time of sending. This piece of crap will not update conversations in real-time even with a valid WiFi connection and the application open. When the conversations are updated the app reflects when the messages were intended to be received but at that point it is useless to be advised of this. FIX THIS GARBAGE APP! I am literally being forced to enter a 1 star rating, DO NOT INSTALL!
Haven't been able to read messages for 4 months. Your app is crap at best.
I Left A review on Facebook app itself, Messenger is very glitchy. and now there is a Stupid Update that doesnt allow easy video chatting with groups. Why? They removed the video call button. and the phone button. Ugh. Fix Your Crap. until they fix it, this review is staying at 2 stars, 2 stars being that it allows communication.
Messenger is obviously an incredibly useful tool for an infinite number of things, obviously maintaining the back end for messenger is an incredible expense on Facebook and they are looking to monetize. As a shareholder I have no problems with this, however it would have been kind to let us know which version installed the ads.. that way we could choose whether or not to upgrade.
I don‚Äôt like having to use 2 different apps that connect to one app. do not like facebook messenger!!
The owner, Doug Sandor, and his team of painters have just finished their 4th project at r home in North Royalton. They painted 3 bathrooms and a bedroom And all ceilings.  What a difference freshly painted walls and ceilings make in your home. It feels like a new home.  They are meticulous painters at a reasonable price. They have A+ ratings in BBB, Angie's list and Home Advisor. I have used them the last 5 years and my husband and I are always 100% satisfied
I don't want messenger to show notifications on my phone. It's frustrating be nagged, every time the app is opened, about allowing them. Facebook, you are a guest on my phone. Show some respect for the my preferences.
I have been getting used to all the changes but I just noticed that when looking at my overall messages, it doesn't show the bubble with someone's profile saying they read it...UNTIL you go into the message and then it shows which doesn't make sense! Please fix this
Each update it just keeps getting worse, and this latest is the worst. I can barely type a sentence without hitting one of the newer keys right above the typing bar. Last time Facebook messenger was good was before we had to get this stupid app!
I recently attempted to use the payments feature of messenger to send a friend $17, after having sent many successful payments through it before. I then found out Facebook decided to cancel this payment, holding the funds but refusing to send them, and accusing me of fraud. Confused, I obliged with their request to see screenshots of my ID, credit cards and bank statement showing the exact transaction. After all this they STILL said I was somehow a fraud and would need an actual bank statement with the transaction. I told them this was ridiculous, and I got a bitchy message back saying my account was not shut, and the support ticket closed.  After I had sent them all of this information. I‚Äôm not sure what kind of operation fb messenger is running, but please avoid ever using this feature unless you want to lose your money and be told to jump through hoops for no reason.  App deleted for good. 
The app closes itself out after a few seconds and is really worthless.
There are so many bugs right now - from online status to the glitch where I have to click on the chat to see if they read it. It‚Äôs extremely frustrating.
Decent app that was ruined with advertising. Just get signal or anything else instead of this app from the greedy trash company that is Facebook (mark, kys)
i‚Äôve been using Facebook and my messenger app on my iPhone now for quite a while. Unfortunately either the Facebook messenger update or the new Apple update as of January 31, 2018 screwed up the connection between Facebook in the messenger app. I can‚Äôt open messenger in my app, it wants to open in the App Store. How ridiculous! Can‚Äôt people tests this before they put out updates? Some days I think about going back to an android. And some days I think about just getting off Facebook entirely.Today is one of those days.

It won‚Äôt syncs with my Apple Watch writer FB messenger no response.
Ads in messenger!? What you doing!?
This app is worst ..there is no logout option in iOS ..I deleted the app n install again.my fb I'd login  in itself....worst app
I don't what FB is trying to do here.  We are already signed up and tied up in your little system.  Please do not complicate it even more by adding these "my day" features to what should be a very simple and straightforward message app. Seeing people's day's shouldn't be on messenger imho.  Please create an option to disable it. That'd be nice 
Why do I have to consistently update it‚Äôs annoying
Messenger emoji is not available.
Fix the calling it keeps crashing when I try to talk to my friend and plus I can't hear
Won‚Äôt let me open attachments. My phone is updated and my app is updated. What a joke.
i can‚Äôt see if someone read my message on messenger. does anyone have the same problem ü§î
Anything Facebook touches greets filled with advertisements. I'm done with it. I don't need you. You ruined Instagram and messenger. Good riddance.
*Want to turn off the activity indicator so people don't know every single time you get on messenger? It's a new feature that they don't show you or tell you about in the update. Open the app -> tap "people" at bottom -> tap "active" on top, then tap on the green indicator button by your name to turn off.   Bloated as usual. I use only 10% of all the functions of the app. Huge ginormous file size and growing.... And now 4K resolution picture shares with NO WAY TO TURN THAT OFF/reduce file size (FYI- all that data usage is not included in your unlimited talk/text data plan folks. Watch it eat up your data fast! I used to have the app enabled on cellular but now since there's no way to state a preference to how you receive images, I enable the app only on wifi- entirely defeating the purpose.   Facebook, can you please remove all that excess garbage in the app no one needs? Make a separate slimmed down messenger maybe??? 
No ‚Äòpreferences‚Äô or settings to silence notifications or to not display a ‚Äònew waiting‚Äô number on the icon anytime somebody I know is simply logged on. This is the worst of ‚Äòdevices‚Äô taking over our lives and monopolizing our time.  Uninstalling.
Desde la antigua actualizaci√≥n no puedo ver quien ve la secci√≥n ‚ÄúMi D√≠a‚Äù y he instalado y desinstalado la app varias veces.
You can‚Äôt even tag people in group messaging anymore with the last update. Which is a horrible thing. Get it together. ‚úäüèº
I just opened messenger and there was an ad. We're seeing enough ads in Facebook itself. The app already takes up a lot of space which is bothersome, now it's cramming more ads at us.
I just like the games and on the iPhone I feel they are behind . Just let me play my games !
App is great but not so great when the logout option has been taken out on iOS , put it back developers!!
I really wish the calendar would stay available!! Please add it back to messenger, it helps with planning all types of events
Stop adding garbage to the function of this app. I do not appreciate having new features added that I can't remove. I also really hate the pull-up camera mode. It was way better when pulling up caused a refresh of the app. Please stop making this app terrible or I'll stop using it like I stopped using the Facebook app. This isn't worth my time. Now there are ads mixed into my conversations? No way, I'm out. Stop trying to be Snapchat and stop forcing me to see ads based on my "interests."
Every time I try to connect it says there is no internet connection
How many times is this app going to ask me to turn on the notifications?! 5-6 different ways when I first download it then every time I open the app. Not to mention, the app is needed to read any Facebook messages. Facebook get your $&@$ together.
Why are there ads now? Please remove them.
Why keep ruining a functional app?? Please bring back the ‚Äúread‚Äù indicator on the conversations list page.  It is frustratingly inconvenient without it! Come on, now!!! 
I would just like to say.............I loved the app when it had the cute emojis. Now they‚Äôre gone and I‚Äôm stuck with the iOS emojis. It‚Äôs quite sad, really.   I thought it was just an issue with my phone, but I did a little search online and found that that‚Äôs not the case.  Other than that, nice app. But seriously. The emojis were one of the best features. )-: 
Seriously this app is unnecessarily insistent that we turn on notifications. EVERY TIME you open the app. And when you first install it!! No, I don‚Äôt want notifications. No, I don‚Äôt want to connect my phone number. Yes, really. Yes, really. YES. REALLY. I keep deleting the app because that warning is so insistent, but it‚Äôs the only way to get messages on your phone.
When I switched to the iPhone I had thought I would love messenger just the same.  I don‚Äôt. I am super disappointed about the lack of chat heads but most of a all that when I receive a call it doesn‚Äôt pop w the option of answering it just appears like a notification on my bar or screen such and such is calling you and by the time it takes me to the app the call is over and I missed it. I just don‚Äôt find it easy or convenient.
I much preferred when messaging was just integrated within the Facebook app, rather than needing to have an entire second app occupying space on my devices.  For that reason alone I give 1 Star. Should be 0.
Made mistake of upgrading.  New iPad version shows text conversations, but they're missing my side of conversation.  Other participants' messages are there, but my replies are gone.  Who tested this?
Anyone else getting issues where the app doesn‚Äôt ring, it just shows a message saying that you missed a call from someone? It‚Äôs been happening to me for the past 2 and a half months now. I‚Äôve even signed off and back on. It worked for about a day then back to just missing calls. Please look into and fix the issue. I know I‚Äôm not the only one with the issue. I‚Äôve heard of my friends having the same issue.
I don‚Äôt like the feature that tells you when someone was on messenger and it shows up on their fb page. Or it‚Äôs all green when you are on messenger. No privacy.
Oh the ways I hate it.  1) Notifications each time I add a friend, notifications for any possible excuse, endless, pointless distractions  2) Far less useful than other messaging apps, u can‚Äôt even copy and paste text from conversations, f.e. an address  3) I access Facebook from chrome, it always sends my iphone on a loop to the AppStore and crashes chrome when I hit the messages button from my Facebook homepage  4) Group chats are clumsy, editing, creating or simply finding out who‚Äôs who‚Äôs on group chats  5) Too many stupid prompts to do things like wave, or let me know somebody happens to be online. 
It‚Äôs a great app and I really love how it‚Äôs set up but the last time you guys updated it, it just started freezing if I would scroll not even half way down my list of people to text. And I would try again and again and it just wouldn‚Äôt work. Now  I don‚Äôt know if this is just what mine did when it updated or not ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I have been hacked several times through Messenger. I have deleted it & will never download it again until more safeguards for privacy are provided.
Adds which take up the whole screen now plow through your messenger window. As if FaceBook weren‚Äôt bed enough about them. Sadly we don‚Äôt have a choice to move off this source for fear of losing contact with others. For now. If I could convince everyone else I know to move to another app I would, and I suggest you do the same.
This is the worst app ever, typical from Apple apps nowadays..
As an artist I set up a Facebook page to promote my music and create a Fanbase every account I have had has been destroyed I even got up to 500 likes it one point on homemade video it‚Äôs all gone. If this account does the same, I‚Äôm done with Facebook! 
Messenger recently deleted ALL of my old messages and I don‚Äôt know how to get them back! I only have like 10 messages overall in there!
The new update is not better. They removed a lot of features. I got a new phone and forgot to turn off auto update and am regretting it.
I can‚Äôt erase any messages what‚Äôs up with that????
Please fix it
ÿ¨ŸäÿØÿØÿØ
It's pointless to update if they cannot fix the messenger app loading on Apple watch series 1... They didn't care older device still using it. That's sad. The app keep loading and stuck on Apple watch ... Can't use it ...Need fix ASAP  Updated 2: still have the same problem... Hope you guys can fix it soon ... Thanks please  Updated 3 still have problems loading messenger on my Apple watch ...I'm tired updated it every week now.  Updated 4 can you tell me that Apple watch app still working? Because it's always stuck at loading messenger 
I know of too many people who are getting their phones damage to/hacked by playing videos and clicking links mass forwarded in messenger. But mass forwarded messages are annoying and considered spam. I think the mass forwarding ability should be turned off by default. Also A person should have to choose turn on the telephone call capability it should not be on by default. It‚Äôs very annoying to have total strangers calling you through Facebook messenger without your permission.
It keeps freezing my phone every time I use it. The bug was obviously not fixed.
They are adding ads to Facebook messenger ! Garbage !
You fixed things that didn‚Äôt need to be fixed, like moving the speaker button, all while not fixing any of the actual bugs! The games don‚Äôt work. The app is bad now. Fix it, please.
I recently acquired an iPhone X and downloaded the messenger. How come the switch menu is not added to the uploaded messenger? Why upload an old version of the messenger?
I can‚Äôt hit the suspend button my iPhone without it ending the call and it is very annoying to get constant updates and none of them useful. I want my phone screen off at night when I call people sometimes and that can‚Äôt happen because the phone call ends whenever I suspend the screen.
Please keep showing who is online. And how long ago they were active.
My boyfriend recently got a message from someone who seemed to be a normal girl in our area. When he opened the message, they made small talk then asked him to video chat through Facebook. He declined. Shortly after, two people start posting on his wall threatening to post videos of him. Once he blocks them and deletes their comments/ messages, they came to me. They posted screenshots of him at that moment threatening to send them to other people if we didn‚Äôt give them what they wanted. They then posted fake screenshots of conversations claiming they were from them. Long story short: someone hacked my boyfriends camera through a message on this app. Facebook & messenger do absolutely nothing to help. In fact, if you block them, you cannot report them unless you unblock you. The only way to unblock someone is to unlock them for a full 48 hours. I will not ever download this app again. In fact I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP TO ANYONE!!
I have tried and tried to get in my original Facebook account. I cannot get in so I set up a new account they google and now when I go to messenger it all comes out in Spanish. I do not know why and I cannot talk to anyone to what is going on.  Very very very disappointed in these systems.
hello why apple user can't send voice memos anymore.? üñïüèΩüñïüèΩüñïüèΩüñïüèΩüñïüèΩüñïüèΩ
I use messenger more than any other text app. I‚Äôve always been a fan but today it updated and got rid of the ‚Äúwho‚Äôs online‚Äù and how long they‚Äôve been offline. Minor details to some but I find these handy. I hope they‚Äôll be back.
Nevermind. I couldn‚Äôt find it at first. Went back and kept searching until I did.
I keep getting hacked on messenger. People use my acct to send my friends advertising and or asking for money. What can I do to prevent this again. It‚Äôs happened 6 times n I keep changing password on FB.
I can‚Äôt send voice messages anymore! It records, then just sits there with the voice bubble open, refusing to send. All I can do is close it.
If you don't have notifications on then there is a full screen pop-up every time you open the app. Now has advertisements in-app, because I don't see enough sponsored content in the Facebook app or the website.
Do not like the fact that the new messenger update doesn‚Äôt tell you whether someone has read your message or not. Are you gonna fix it as it was before? Why you guys are going backwards with useless updates?
This app was legit and cool but now it‚Äôs crashing and keeps saying reconnected connected and is not working ... fix the app people it needs a big update
I don‚Äôt see why I‚Äôm force to download this stupid app. Ok if that‚Äôs the case then I will not text anyone on Facebook.
Despite upgrading to a brand new iPhone X, this app persists to claim I cannot login to messenger because of an internet connection. The only time it connects is when I am connect to WiFi. The app will not connect to the internet when I‚Äôm off WiFi, using my data...which is unlimited btw. So????? How ya gonna fix this, Facebook?
I SAID I WANT A PEP PIZZA HE SAID YES OMG IM LIKE BOOOOOOOM 
I have tried multiple times to uninstall and reinstall Messenger and the Facebook app...and this does not help to load any of my messages. I can see I have a message pending to be opened on the Facebook app...but it won‚Äôt allow for me to see who it‚Äôs from or see any of my previous messages from other people. They simply don‚Äôt load. Very disappointed.
Photo editing used to have a ton of capabilities, now when I ‚Äúremix‚Äù it only lets me draw and add a handful of emojies. Plus it glitches when you zoom in to draw and won‚Äôt let you zoom back out to send, have to crash the app. Using an iPhone 7 with latest software update. Maybe I‚Äôm missing something - any ideas Facebook?
Realllly not a fan of this version with the ads in the conversation list. Terrible.
Messenger doesn't open
Stop notifying me on messenger when I make a new Facebook friend
App is a piece of crap.  Without even updating it changed on its own.  Can't see who is online anymore just if they have the messenger app.  Fb messenger needs to stop changing n fix the old problems not make the app retarded. Now you can't see who is online on Facebook app or messenger app unless you're on a darn computer.. 
It‚Äôs annoying. I had to select ‚Äòno‚Äô multiple times and also every time I open the app.
My message request will not load at all! This needs to be fixed!
How can you display ads even in the middle of my messages?! I hope this is just a short experiment and everyone will hate it. I'm deleting the app in a week if not...
Whenever i post a good quality video on my story when it‚Äôs posted quality becomes literally trash and you can barely see what i posted, fix that please
Facebook now has ads on Messenger as well as Facebook.They use this app to spy on your conversations in order to market to you.Terrible option
Why is it when I‚Äôm in a group chat and I‚Äôm recording a message it will freeze if someone‚Äôs bubble drops. It‚Äôs super frustrating!  Fix it forever! Thank you so much!
Not a huge deal, but I can‚Äôt change the name of a group chat. I click on ‚ÄúChange Name‚Äù and nothing happens. Y‚Äôall update the app three times every minute and you still have dumb bugs like that? Cmon Son.
I loved messenger then it updated and now I can't find my messenger games.
Feel insecure, as though this messenger app is mimipulated to the point I am not appreciating changes made so rapidly. Like being in a room with out doors or windows and anyone can call without a number or theycan all easily get to be involved without knowing. So actually ithis messenger app is more than I need. Maybe as people use it more I may be attempted to try again. I do not know enough to give a review.
The app won‚Äôt let me delete messages
Lagging with typing and strange delays occurring while typing.
My messenger was updated automatically recently and now it constantly freezes. Very disappointing. Please fix it ASAP!!
Had a conversation with someone I thought was legitimately catching up. It quickly tuned toward strange when they started telling me of a government program that doesn‚Äôt fit my situation. I quickly ended the conversation, and I tried to view their profile, but that option doesn‚Äôt even appear in messenger for this person. I‚Äôve tried reporting it to Facebook, but it has me going in circles to where I can‚Äôt even report this in a different category because it requires you to be on the profile in question.  Logged out. Changed password. Deleted Facebook and Messenger from phone. 
Do I have to have Facebook to sign up BC I dont want to
I was hacked through messenger and have never been so disappointed.  It was a mess and had to contact fb to get every thing re done.  Please get better or you will be history.
Having trouble accessing some games on messenger
Needs a delete button
Every time I try to log in it tells me I don‚Äôt have internet access for the messenger app. The Facebook app works fine. There needs to be a way to click and it automatically logs you in. Not sure why it claims to not have internet. Everything else works.
Awesome üëçüèª
Can you bring back the green online icons on the main page to show who is online? I don‚Äôt care who has the app. Let me see who is online. Big dislike. üëéüèª
They‚Äôve integrated ads as your scroll through contacts... Annoying. One star!
Why did the blue mark not appear now after I got out of the conversation with someone ... and I had to enter the conversation again to know how to read it or not?
I really like this app because it allows me to get in touch with all of my Facebook friends even if I don‚Äôt have their phone number. Now I see you can send money though this app. That is pretty cool too I haven‚Äôt tried it. Someone advised me not to use it because of security issues. I think I will just wait and see what others think before trying it myself.
Do I have to have Facebook to use this app?
So I hate hot Facebook forces you to download another app just to view your messages. Also, I don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm the world these two apps take up soooo much space on my phone no matter what I do.i want Facebook to go back to one stop shop so to speak and have access for everything in one app that doesn‚Äôt take up as much space on my phone storage.
Got people just that I play a game with,can't seems to remove or delete,hit name game will not open,update your app to clear all if I want to
Should not need
This is a fantastic way to keep up with old and new friends
I am unable to delete old messages like I was able to do before.
What an awesome easy way to communicate. It‚Äôs a tool that has brought me great success in my business
üòç
It‚Äôs good
There needs to be better Security
There‚Äôs a switch user glitch u have to log in multiple times ‚Äúan error‚Äù. Always occurs it will log me out for no reason and put me in a recent loggers Facebook that‚Äôs not okay.
I love how easy it is to use. Only thing I don‚Äôt like which is in the new update is you can‚Äôt see if read or not from the main screen.
Solo que no me gusta que no puedes desactivar la opci√≥n de no permitir llamadas ni videollamada eso a fuerza quiere tu lo permitas
to keep in touch with my children who are my clients.
Que sigan mejorando m√°s
Good Day Sir, I just want complain about your new messenger Update, Because the update now is not good for us, we dont want to remove the "My Day" we want it back, so hoping that you will get it back.   Thank you! 
Really like the group chat option. It allows you to add more people than a group text.
Excellent
Good to be able to personalize messages to FB friends.  Easy to use and reliable.
I have to keep removing Messenger because of all the chain letters I receive. Is there a way to block chain letters without blocking friends?
It drives me nuts that I can‚Äôt delete messages easier. Have to press & hold each one then press delete conversation.
Nice app
I don‚Äôt like the new update.
But off a different computer I have all my apps except Facebook messenger it wants to revert to a different Itune's account
I still dislike that messenger has separated from facebook and it‚Äôs so annoying that every time I go to messenger it prompts me to add notifications. The only reason I keep this app is to see what my friend have sent me.
Ever since I updated to the latest version of fb messenger it keeps telling me that I do not have notifications alert turned on and prompting me too. I DONT want to turn on notifications so stop asking! Whoever made this decision messed up and causes me the urge to uninstall this app every time the pop up appears.
Speaker volume is very low
When the connection is good it‚Äôs great, but it can be spotty. Sometimes hard to get through.
My phone decides to completely restart 1/4 times I open this app. Just use a different app, this isn't worth it. The call quality isn't that good either. Only thing I like is you can tell when someone is typing a message to you, but other apps do this just as well.
Me gusta es algil me gustar√≠a que sea m√°s limpia ya que se l ve muy sucia en si mucha cosa mas minimalista
Excelente
Great APP. Performance is excellent!
Better than instant messenger?
Great way to send a private message
There are several loose areas that I don‚Äôt appreciate. 1 if you choose not to use it, FB FORCES THE APP ON YOU. Also people get in and solicit you when you have high security on the FB ACCOUNT, and in the app, there‚Äôs no place to delete past conversations. If we don‚Äôt want it, FB SHOULDNT FORCE IT BY LEAVING THE red Dot up, or by soliciting anyone‚Äôs contacts. Not a great, secure App at all. 
You truly get a 0 rating as for well over 9 months now, you Stopped allowing your users to delete finished conversation from messenger itself.  Please change it back!!! 
Awesome
It‚Äôs absolute cancer that you cannot turn off game notifications in the app
I love it that you can privately keep in close contact with family and friends anytime! It‚Äôs great!
When you get a new ‚Äúfriend‚Äù it automatically puts in a conversation on Messenger. Then to delete it, it is a two step process. Most apps today have easy slide method to delete
I haven‚Äôt been able to load this app on my iPad for almost two months now.
I love Messenger as a great alternative to sharing information only with your friends , family or contacts. 
My account is totally lagging, I cannot do anything, it keeps loading for hours and I cannot transfer from home to people when I touch people on the screen. Please fix this asap. Thank you. 
Love messenger, good way for people I don‚Äôt talk to often to stay in touch.
I don‚Äôt want notifications, I don‚Äôt want to text, I don‚Äôt to send video messages, I just want to see my Facebook messages. It connects and then disconnects. I wish it would go back to the old messaging and you didn‚Äôt to have the app on your phone to see your Facebook messages
ü§™ü§™
Very good App and it is very well made.
Great way to connect with family and friends
Please simplify the app it's taking up too much storage and remove the "Day" feature stop trying to be like Snapchat or instagram
In order for the public to feel value by FB or this it should provide a human interactive by phone to address concerns. Without that I do not see this being in existence much longer. You can call me for opinion 404-538-1249. Thank you
Great way to communicate by texting and verbally and with different languages, it also provides other features that I‚Äôm still learning to use
Typing while others are texting you messes up your text and some words like One are always capitalized automatically.
You guys are like the best people ever sense day 1 I got out of my brain surgery and then I had another one come back to my mind and now I‚Äôm kicking major butt and I am thankful for that and what I have been through. So thank you guys for everything you have done for me.
I have to re-download this app and delete it and re-download it again and again and again, etc......... SO ANNOYING!!
Messenger has been constantly crashing and glitching in Iphone X. Atleast 4 times a day it stops working, nothing on the app works and then just crashes. This is getting really really annoying. Please fix this.
It‚Äôs okay but sometimes when I want to make a call and they answer the call drops or the other way around and it still drops at first u thought it was my connection but I had full bars and it still didn‚Äôt work and I like that they have games that u can play and u can message people no problem
I updated messenger and they removed games
Updates are slooooooow!!!!!!!!!!
How do you remove messenger notifications from the Facebook app without downloading the messenger app. I don't want to receive messenger messages. Only want the Facebook app.
Today was the day I made a life changing decision. That day I will never forget it started out as a normal day up early fixing coffee sitting on the porch watching over the farm while the sun rises. Nice beautiful day one cup of coffee down sun has risen two cups of coffee down. I go in watch the weather to see how the next weeks weather is going to look like so I can plan ahead. All looks good off to the barn on the tractor and away with the bush hog in tow listening to my favorite station on Pandora as I was mowing along watching the fence line I was distracted by Facebook messenger I heard a noise looked up and it was two late I had mowed through the fence and ran over tow beef master calf‚Äôs spraying them over a half acre I turned out of the field and got back on course moral of the story I should of had three cups of COFFEE I will never make that mistake again LOL
Handy to have when you don‚Äôt have your friends phone number. The only downside is the calling feature doesn‚Äôt work very well, it keeps cutting out & doesn‚Äôt go through when you try to talk on it. Good only for texting. Need to improve on voice calling feature.
Great to stay in touch with family and friends that you don‚Äôt see anymore. I think Facebook  is a treasure . I love it!!!
Every time I try to view my messages on messenger it gets stuck loading and all I see is the icon spinning not allowing me to view anything, very disappointing.
Messanger is the best application , it makes communication easy üíï
Love the app message my family. Friends and no friends. Lol. Calls are so clear.  Thanks for let us use it 
Please bring back the old group call . It‚Äôs so difficult now . Fix it please
When will this come it‚Äôs more easier for us to get a message and to  send one
Pas terrible peut mieux faire
I hate that I have to have it on my Facebook period. I don‚Äôt like messenger and all the stupid chain mail spam where people get hacked all the time. Can Facebook divorce messenger and give us the option to not have it? I had to give it a star and I feel it was one star to many just to write this review
Auto deleted chats
Facebook is so ignorant, perhaps your social medium should give competency tests and encourage truth and fact, instead of opinion and preference.
Never have I had to uninstall and reinstall an app more than I have with this one. I hate using it,but some people only use this app as their primary means of communication.
I don‚Äôt want notifications
The stupidest crap I‚Äôve ever seen.
Best way to gossip in private
My messenger usually works, but after updating yesterday it keeps shutting down every time I try to open a message someone sends me. I would really appreciate it if this was fixed. Once this is fixed I would give the app 5 out of 5 stars.
Perfecto
Hurts my eyes at night when I use it.
Great God Bless
Rated ages 4+! Keep supporting pedophiles scumbags!
The app worked fine before the update. Now it won't even load. It keeps say "trying to connect" the switches to "connected" then back. Very frustrating
this is definitely the most annoying app I had on my phone, constantly pressuring to turn on notifications with an in-app notification. Desperate attempt at trying to encroach on users more than facebook already has.  Do not download.
I just updated my messenger app after about 1.5 years of not updating it and now it won‚Äôt even let me send a message and keeps telling me not connected. Although my WiFi is top notch and works for EVERYTHING else
Too much fake news and senseless forced  advertisement!!
It is good appüëç
Thank you for allowing me to keep in touch with my family and a lot of other folks, easier than ever!
Messenger is easy and user friendly. It has my closest friends and I can contact those that I haven‚Äôt talked to in a while because we are connected via Facebook. Smart!! And it‚Äôs fun too - with the new faces üòÇ
The frames that constantly appear when the camera is used are so annoying...make it stop!! And make it alert properly...grrrr 
Messenger is the most annoying AP out there. I would delete it, except I use it for personal communication. Hate the chain letters and people asking me to make things go viral!
It was good and so far no complaints.
Can talk evryon at one Yay 
Does not work that well because it doesn‚Äôt give you enough options. Not to mention that FB probably spurs on your messages and page and you have no privacy.
Mssgr was integrated into FB at one point in time. Once log off Facebook, mssgr closes as well. No hassle, no breach of privacy, and life was all good. But not for long!!! Because soon after, some moron thought it would be a great idea to split the two!! Gone is the one-click Log Off that closes both FB and mssgr!! The hassle of navigating your way around your FB account setting and close any open session within mssgr to close or log off on the app is a pain in the rear!! Logging out on FB does not close mssgr like it used to!! I have fallen victim to this terrible idea many times, where friends and loved ones borrowed my phone, open the app and read all my privies!! I keep making the mistake of thinking logging off FB closes mssgr as well. Remember Windows Vista? The worst OS ever that became a nightmare for Microsoft??!! Well, Vista is to Operating Systems as FB Mssgr is to social media!! If it\'s not broken, don\'t fix it!!
Easy way to stay in touch
All my friends from far away can be in touch with me
Very good app. To talk video and chat with people from all over the world!
Kept reminding you to turn on notifications. Fuc that.
Too many chain messages
I‚Äôm no longer getting notifications about messages not even the red number telling me I have a message. I‚Äôve even had some lines of messages disappear from the other person...
Do not like Messenger and tried to remove it from my Facebook account. Although it is inactive it still shows the number of people who have left me messages. Frustrating!!! 
As soon as you use it to message someone, they will forever be able to tell when you are on Facebook. Complete loss of privacy. Even if you delete messenger, your name will still be in their messenger account and they can see the last time you logged on.
This app has a stupid, it requires notifications be on. Otherwise it always shows that you have a notification. No, you friggin idiots. I don‚Äôt want notifications when I‚Äôm in the middle of a presentation from my phone.   Well you can temporarily disable it. Well shut up. I don‚Äôt want to have to remember to turn it off. 
The update is not any good
Hate we are forced to use it Wish I could cut if off. Wish I could turn off calls and video calls. This app is irritating AF. 
It seems like the latest update had some bugs. Now I‚Äôm not able to send or receive message or even load voice messages. Please add way / tool to contact support team for any issue. 
Better than a postcard
pretty much.
Why does the app keeps on changing when I didn‚Äôt even updated it. What‚Äôs the point of updating when y‚Äôall are just gonna change it whenever you want. I liked the way it was before but you keep changing it and the app just keeps on crashing. Smh. So disappointed.
üòª
To many spammers üòñ
I like it
It saying I have a message when I really don‚Äôt. I will click the message clearly nothings there. if I‚Äôm in the message that supposedly bolded, it says that I have a new message elsewhere. Please fix this. This is the first time this happened.
This app is worse than the Holocaust.   If I had a gun and was in an elevator with Hitler and the zodiac killer, I would kill myself so I don't have to see this app ever again.   I would rather the Patriots win the next ten Superbowls than see another notification about someone joining messenger.   The only thing worse than this app might be stepping on a Lego.  No wait... This app is still worse.   I have relatives in prison that I'M JEALOUS of because they don't have to deal with this app.  I hate this app so much that I hope cancer isn't cured just so the developers get the chance to suffer for what they've done.   0 out of 10, WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND. 
I can‚Äôt delete like three market place conversations. For the past month and a half. I HATE SEEING those old messages in there. FIX THIS!!! Ughhhh
Helpful
I just want to sent a message.  I don‚Äôt want their blood type or spiritual anything.  I hate this stupid intruding app and now recall why I deleted it two years ago.  Seriously, why should I have to search for a way to send a message to a new person?   It‚Äôs called ‚Äúmessenger‚Äù!   This is just utter garbage.    This is stupid. 
I love this app holy moly! No what would be really cool? Time delay text messages. For instance, it‚Äôs currently 1:14am and I‚Äôd like to send my best friend an idea I have that I‚Äôm excited about....hence can‚Äôt sleep....however, I don‚Äôt want to disturb her at that hour if she doesn‚Äôt quiet her phone, I would be able to write the text and have it delivered in 8 hours üëçüèºüòç
I like the original before they made this crappy app!!!
I never had an issue with this app this app is great no lag and if you have WiFi there should be no problem with calls or FaceTimes best sending app ever
Constant disconnect and reconnect bug for iPhone 5s.   Was working well before update.  Now deplorable.
For some reason I can‚Äôt see the little bubble in the bottom right of chat? Idk if you get what I‚Äôm saying. I cant see if people open my message
If you download this app, they will be watching you.
DO NOT FORCE ME TO UPDATE. I DO NOT CARE ABOUT NEW FEATURES WHICH ONLY MAKE THE APP BLOATWARE AND DRAINS THE BATTERY. IT IS A CHATTING APP AND DOES NOT NEED MANY FEATURES. App developers don‚Äôt care or read these reviews.
Just maybe? Amazingly creepy and intrusive behavior
I use this application constantly especially the video chat and the problem that I have is the hang up button on the video chat sometimes just doesn‚Äôt show up please fix this problem I‚Äôd really appreciate it.
On iPhone X when you open the emoji keyboard it blocks the text box so you can‚Äôt press send or see what you‚Äôre typing.
I have been having problems sharing photos sent to me via text on my phone and then sending them to messenger. I keep getting the following message ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Send Message Check Your Connection and Try Again.‚Äù I am connected to WiFi at home and I have used my cellular data and I keep getting the same message. I used to be able to send them Please Fix This Problem A.S.A.P.
Let's see during a western Union transaction I was given a fake hundred dollar bill at the Lihue Hawaii store. I noticed it almost immediately but when I called them to report it and ask what could be done they told me that I was screwed. and they will not exchange it.  I said this hundred dollar bill has Red Congee lettering on it. And if you review the cameras it will be obvious that The girl at the register handed me this bill. They said that they cannot view the footage and that security in Oahu had to. Almost a week and a half has went bye. I hadn't heard for them like They said they were gonna call me. The manager then tells me that even if she viewed the footage. And saw that the hundred was fake its still policy not to exchange it.  I'm broke my folks you sent me the money are broke.  What do you guys think my next move should be. Mike B
Somewhere along the update history they removed the ability to switch to the active tab and turn off ‚Äòlast active‚Äô so that you cannot hide when you were last on. It still works on the android version but the iOS version is not showing the ability to toggle off your last active. This is a major issue with me because I don‚Äôt want certain individuals to always see me online and disturb me at certain times.
Why are we getting ads in the app?
Excelente aplicaci√≥n
Should be part of Facebook.
Sometimes my Messages refuse to send, and I can be holding a conversation and then the next thing ik my messages wont deliver I will Rate 5‚≠êÔ∏ès if this gets fixed
Unless the watch version can actually be opened on an Apple Watch (Series 3 wOS 4.1) this is going to stay at a one. It‚Äôs been a month and it never opens.
I don‚Äôt want to get notified of messages  Do I have to answer 10 Times  No  And keep getting forced and bugged to do it . Also when  chatting on video  I want to be able to control audio  Or mute it  And you can‚Äôt so that   Just frustrating 
.
Constantly opening this app because a badge is displayed, only to find out that it is spam - ‚Äúconnect to Instagram‚Äù or some such nonsense.
I love messenger better than Facebook... To much drama and arguing... Messenger is private... Conversations are private... Love it
Love it
App has stopped running
It works fine, but it constantly tries to force you to turn on updates and will send you false notifications on Facebook to try to remind you to turn on notifications. So the creators of this app basically have no respect for the fact that you may have notifications off for a reason. The app also stopped working for me at one point because I didn‚Äôt agree to turn on notifications.
Why would you guys remove when someone sees your message? Now you have to open the conversation to see if the person saw your message. Before you could see it without opening it.
There‚Äôs so many bugs and glitches it‚Äôs impossible to use sometimes.  -The text box doesn‚Äôt always open when you click on it. And at times when it does open nothing will type.  -The scroll bar of who is active now at the top is extremely annoying. There‚Äôs a spot where you can see who is active so it‚Äôs unnecessary   -You can no longer appear offline when you are using the app  -The constant annoying notifications to sync with your address book or Instagram  -The flashing video button all the time  -When you try to switch between two accounts, I constantly get a notification saying my session expired and it makes me log back in to the one I was trying to switch off of.   -You can no longer see when someone reads a message unless you open the conversation.  For a start. 
when trying to send voice memo through messenger it always says, ‚Äúcheck connection and try again,‚Äù when my connection is fine. Fix this
And now cannot get into messenger at all. Please fix the glitch!
This new update is okay but the fact that I have to go into a message to see if it has been read or not is annoying.
When I send photos I am not allowed to see the pictures. When I click on the persons name and scroll down to the shared photos I can‚Äôt see them. I have to send a photo to actually see the photos I sent in the past. Not only that, when I use an older device for messenger, I can see the photos without having to send one. When I use my newer phone I can‚Äôt see them, I have to send one for I don‚Äôt know reasons. This is likely a simple fix, but it is hard to see this actually happening. When nothing in this app has been fixed, but only progressively getting worse.
Please go back to where we could just msg on the Facebook App!
If I don't choose to enable notifications for this app, then the app should not pester me with a red exclamation point that notifications are not enabled every time I open it. OR, if I simply enable badges for notifications, that is not good enough for Facebook, NO. It must be badges, sounds, lock screen, everything across the board, or I am continually pestered by messenger to enable notifications. FAIL! üëéüëéüèªüëéüèºüëéüèΩüëéüèæüëéüèøüëé
I try to login and it‚Äôs say to enter my number so I did and I never got a text message confirming the account set up..I tried on different phones and still doesn‚Äôt work
I‚Äôve been using messenger for a while because my boyfriend and I call each other almost every day using the app. Recently I haven‚Äôt been able to put the calls on speaker AT ALL and it‚Äôs bugging me so much. I‚Äôve contacted support many times and I‚Äôve heard nothing from them, I usually don‚Äôt review an app but I‚Äôm getting so sick of this problem. Get better customer service Facebook....
I really regret posting something for sale on fb, my messenger app got over 100 interested person and all of a suden I need to scroll over 100 rows to get to the messages with the people that I know. This is just plain stupid design. Stop trying to be everything and stop copying other companies, fb is not about people I know and connect with anymore. 
wth, Facebook? After the last update, suddenly I get ‚ÄúSession expired‚Äù and must reconfirm my name, phone number and the #%‚Ç¨¬£ing request to ‚Äòsync my contacts‚Äô before seeing messages? Every. Single. Time.? This better be a bug and not a ‚Äúfeature‚Äù.
Its like your average messaging app. What I found to be pretty cool was that if you have a group chat going you can video call all of them at the same time. Tbh that blew my mind and i loved it.
The app randomly updated and now you can no longer see when your message is delivered or read unless you open the conversation which I think is obnoxious. And sent videos are showing up squished when played for some reason.
Glitches with the voice messages not posting, with conversation history being lost, with recorded messages not playing...ugh.
Remove from my purchased list.
I dont know if its the app but every time i try and long in another account or just click on a conversation it would freeze and restart my phone. When i have music playing it would make a weird noise and stop completely when im on messenger it has been happening since this morning and it frustrating to use because of how many times is happens. My phone hasnt restarted with any other app but this one
THIS IS THE WORST APP EVER BECAUSE ITS NOT WORKING AT ALL FOR MY APPLE WATCH SO FIX IT PLEASE
Before installing this app, üó£I suggest you do your research first thing FIRSTüò≥
Works fine on my phone - Apple Watch won‚Äôt load.  Followed the helps in line - not working - un-installing.
I have join fFacebook for many years! Have enjoy it,however I add the messager app! And the last two weeks!! It has not worked for me! I CAN NOT SEE people I don‚Äôt know!! For an example I have place some things in the marketplace! A lot of people have wanted to buys my things! I have not been able to see these people on the messager app! Over the summer I sold some stuff on the marketplace and I was able to see these people on the messenger app!! PLEASE PLEASE HELP ME TO FIX THIS!! Thanks
üòòü§ô
I came to read the reviews because a friend told me about them. And he was completely correct! All you people leaving 1 Star and complaining about this app are üíØstupid and ridiculous. THIS IS A FREE APP JUST LIKE FACEBOOK IS FREE!! And you still come here to write a stupid review. Smh ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Entitlement much?! Stop complaining! I think Facebook should start charging to use its apps including messenger! Erase Facebook and this one if you guys hate it so much. Both my Facebook and my messenger work excellent. And if they didn‚Äôt, too bad! You ever hear the saying, you get what you pay for? Well your not paying anything for either of these apps and look ignorant coming here to write reviews that are bitchy. You are choosing to download these FREE APPS! Let me say that again so I know you heard me. YOU CHOOSE TO DOWNLOAD THESE FREE APPS! So enjoy them. Facebook deserves more respect and gratitude than they receive. I think your doing a excellent job Facebook, connecting me to my friends and family from all over. I appreciate your hard work and you deserve more credit than you actually receive. I wish I could give a million stars instead of just the five.     Dori Baker
This version of messenger doesn‚Äôt show me the message read notifications..and doesn‚Äôt show me the old conversations.. please fix it soon ..
Bring back messenger lite.
Don't say it's my phone because it only happens when getting notification from messenger and also during multitasking from other app to messenger.
I have 2 facebook accounts, 1 personal and 1 business. It has been happening oftenly when I try to switch between accounts, it logs me out and keep asking me to go back to the account I am using. If I want to switch to the other account, I have to type in email and password all over again. PLEASE FIX!! Also, once I switch between accounts, I lose all the stickers I downloaded. I have to download them all over again when I switch!!!
You‚Äôre doing amazing Facebook. Make it really easy and fun to talk to all my family around the world. I really miss the style of the emojis you had üòï I felt they expressed my emotions much more than regular iPhone emojis, please take this into account I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one that misses them üòÖ at least I hope.  Keep being great. 
I want my speaker phone option back, and move the party call somewhere else.
There‚Äôs a bug where if you switch account it resets and has you sign in to your Facebook all over again and that‚Äôs very annoying
This application should include do not disturb feature. One should be able to set it up to be in silent mode during a specific period of time.
The guy above me must be from another planet if he just downloaded Facebook.
Facebook is stupid and the messenger is stupid. I don't like being forced to take it! We should have a choice to use it or not!  I don't trust this app.  I prefer to not use it and stick with the old ways.  I also don't like the fact that in order for us to chat with someone on Facebook we have to have the messenger and that is wrong. What is one to speak to somebody on the line with us through video or audio it's very poor. I am looking other instant messengers so I can get rid of this garbage. 
I would rather cut my balls off, char them, and eat them slowly rather than to use this app again.
PLEASE COMBINE FACEBOOK APP AND FACEBOOK MESSENGER! I DON‚ÄôT LIKE HOW I WAS FORCED TO DOWNLOAD FACEBOOK MESSENGER!

Unhappy that I cannot delete a message without reading it first. I get too many unwanted emails, and I just want to delete while it‚Äôs unread, just like I can do on Facebook on my desktop computer. 
A few days now, I haven‚Äôt been able to preview if my message is read; when I‚Äôm in messages. I can see when I click on the individual message, but it‚Äôs awkward. Needs to be fixed
Every time I try to switch my Facebook accounts it signs me out even tho I have in password not required
Why no pop up chat heads?
I can no longer do video calls, send gifs, or a voice call
The app won‚Äôt let me sign in and it says wrong password a lot and y‚Äôall need to fix that and when I was signed in it wouldn‚Äôt let me send photos
I can't even log in to my fb messenger . Please fixed the problem
They should definitely add messenger back to the actual FB app. A separate app was completely unnecessary and it's annoying switching back and forth between the two apps.
With the funding Facebook has, a lighter, less buggy, non-forcefully phone crashing messaging app can be made. Developers on a much smaller scale have done it. Please find out why this app is a monster and improve it.
Now there‚Äôs ads in messenger. Get messenger lite, no ads. Zuckerberg once again ruining everything with ads.
Tengo varios d√≠as con problemas al tratar de usar Messenger se queda detenida no hace nada y solo en estos iPhones
In messanger,voice recording is very kibosh.i wanna good recording system.
I think the old system was better than using separate/different Messenger App.
Its canceld every 28 second ..
I would like to have messenger to permanently delete when I delete!!! My messenger has frozen again!!!!!!!!!!! 
This app is extremely useful for not only meeting people but for networking!!!! It‚Äôs absolutely amazing, since I‚Äôve started using this app my company has tripled in profits!!!!!!!! I would recommend this app to everyone! Even my dog!!! It‚Äôs just that awesome!!! Thank you for helping me build teamgetmoney.net !!!!
I can no longer safely browse in the public. As soon as I open the app I am greeted with advertisements containing nudity. Well done.
I‚Äôm on an special interest chat group and can‚Äôt send members of eBay listings on certain items for sale
It isnt as accutate as Facebook. Can't log out. I'd be happier if the pictures in messenger match the actual pictures on FB. Video needs more stability, could use more entertainment. Maybe be able to play and send games with each other like game pigeon?
The previous version was good. Because there I could see the seen status from the home page in the messenger. I need not to open the chat. But in this new version, I can‚Äôt see. So it is not user friendly at all.
Most annoying app. 1) Notifies a message every Facebook friend connect - don‚Äôt need that. Wants you to invite everyone on earth. 2) Notifies Page Managers of every tiny action and gives numerous ‚Äútips‚Äù on increasing Facebook‚Äôs revenue. (I manage multiple pages, know what I‚Äôm doing for clients, and don‚Äôt need my time wasted by a barrage of notices. 3) Makes you ‚Äúread‚Äù every message in order to get it to grey-out and remove from red flag on both messenger and facebook. Wasted time.   IT NEEDS AN EASY ‚ÄúMARK ALL AS READ‚Äù button. That means all those unneeded tips too. My pages have that, why not Messenger.    Comment, this is like someone at Facebook telling us ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll read my messages or else‚Äù 
Now I can no longer switch between accounts and it‚Äôs stuck on one I don‚Äôt need at the moment so I just deleted it to hopefully sign in to the one I need. . . Just started it again and it‚Äôs back to normal now, I don‚Äôt know wth that was aboutüôÑü§®üò°
This thing has made my iPhone restart 4 Times in the last week.
Same issues. Deleted.  Goodbye!
Messaging is great. I prefer the gifs in this app compared to others. The issue I have is with the calling portion. The majority of the bugs have been worked out and I thought was no longer a problem until tonight my mom who lives in another country tried doing a group call with my brother and I for her birthday. I could hear my mom and my brother. My mom could hear my brother and i. But my brother could only hear my mom. The camera and video chat didn‚Äôt work for anyone, which wasn‚Äôt that big of deal just would have been nice as an option since we don‚Äôt see our mom often.
The app doesn‚Äôt work properly. It crashes all the times. Please fix it ASAP!!!!
I don't feel a second app was required to pm folks from fb.  The number one problem I have with this app. As a matter of fact I can accept the others.  The only issue and problem is the constant glitch that never removes the notifications. I shouldn't have to remove and download every week because your app glitches. I download it and then it reveals the messages I apparently missed. Messages I know I've checked. 
I came from an Android over to Apple to give Apple another go but compared to your Android app, You gotta bring back the chat heads/chat bubbles option and multiple notification sounds to the iOS. Cause those two is what brought to me and probably some others of Messenger, being full of expression than being the same as every one else in Apple with the same exact boring Bing sound thinking it's ours but it's actually another person's. Come on Apple! Let us express ourselves!
So very recently I started having problems where on the home screen the gray bubble where it shows that the person has not or read the messages keeps disappearing. I have deleted the app gotten the app back and it done it now for the second time. I don‚Äôt know what to... anyone else having this problem??
Your apps are garbage and run better in the browser. Stop forcing people to use your apps.
I am unable to sign in and see my messages. It says I am unable to connect to the internet but I have internet very frustrating
Messenger keeps crashing since new iOS update. Yes messenger is up to date also
Why can‚Äôt I see when my messages are delivered or read on the messenger screen anymore? I have to go into the actual messages
Needs to be updated. It wont let me log out of my account to get into another one without having to do it multiple times.
It‚Äôs happened to me 137 times and I have  like 10 fbs and it happens more and more‚Äô , our society has been hacked ppl the struggle is real and the government lies they are monitoring us every where thru everything now if u don‚Äôt think this is true ur an idiot!!!! Nothing is secure online anymore unless u pay for it and not always even then!!!!!:( so sad from ..... Iowa:)
Hi!  When switching between accounts, I have to relogin and it with give me a couple of error messages that I have to close out each time.  It is also constantly asking for me to link my phone number. Can we just say no once. Thanks! 
they really need to step up their game to be competitive in the messenger business...
You‚Äôre starting to put ads in messenger now? It might be time to uninstall soon.
Every time you do an update it deletes my stickers. And this time I had to sign in again and I‚Äôm asked annoying questions like do I want notifications, which I DON‚ÄôT! You need to make this app more user considerate! üò°
Why split it off? And why can‚Äôt I decide I DON‚ÄôT WANT NOTIFICATIONS ON without you telling me I should?
I hate this app & wish people would stop using it to send messages to me!  It‚Äôs stupid and redundant to get text messages in two different apps.  I don‚Äôt want to have to look it.  I keep removing it from my phone, but then Facebook gets all naggy about messages waiting for me messenger... and I think ‚Äúwhat if one of them is actually important?‚Äù  So I load it back on & am typically disappointed‚Äî especially if it‚Äôs some company like Little Black Pant group with whom I want nothing to do, ever!   This awful app tend to annoy me further by always have a flag as if there‚Äôs something I‚Äôve missed.... but really, it‚Äôs just that the app is clumsy and nags me night & day.  Ick! WORST OF ALL, Facebook LIES to try to get me to reinstall Messenger.   Just this morning, Facebook told me to reinstall Messenger so I could read 9+ messages waiting for me there.  Against my better judgment, I installed & check ed it.  As the app started up, it said that I had 10 messages waiting.  But it lied!   There were no messages waiting from friends.... but there were about 10 attempts during the reloading to get me to release my entire address book &/or to enable notifications.  At some points it seems as if there‚Äôs no way to reject these bossy attempts.    This app is bad news!  My actual friends know my mobile number and can text me directly (attaching photos & videos if desired).  Some of my friends use Snapchat to send videos &/or photos and messages, and that‚Äôs also fine, but, after posting this review, I will delete Messenger one last time ‚Äî and I will never reload it! 
Unconscionable pursuit of the contacts on my phone, which are mostly business clients who I have no social interaction with. Every time I access the app it asks me to add my phone number then allow access to my contacts. There‚Äôs no other way to describe it except harassment. Don‚Äôt give them the data they want, suffer the consequences.
I really love the messenger app, but when I go to switch accounts it resets & I have to log into the account again. Please fix this. Also I would like to see when my messages are read again without having to click on the persons name. Thank you.
You can log in but none of the convos are loadingüòïüòïüòï
Great app... Love it. Experiencing a bug tho. I've been chatting with a few of my friends and when I change conversation (after few times) the app lags and sends me to apple screen and my phone restarts... This is 3rd time I'm experiencing it. Could be because of my keyboard (I'm using ReBound) and I'm playing music in the background  Edit: I deleted my keyboard but the problem still persists  Edit 2: Even without the music, the issue isn't resolved... As I mentioned earlier, It happens after every few times I change conversations or try to delete some.            I didn't count how many times it happened but if I take a guess, I'd say around 8-10 times  I'm using an iPhone 6+ running on iOS 10.3.2 
QUIT ASKING ME TO SYNC MY PHONE LIST CONTACTS!!! I‚Äôve said no once that should be enough!!! I constantly will have a notification that again I say NO to. Obviously I don‚Äôt want to SYNC MY PHONE CONTACTS. ASKING ONCE SHOULD BE ENOUGH!!! Not a bazillion!!!  Horrible update. Every time I switch between accounts now it tells me my session is expired and I have to log in umpteen million times a day. Never did that before. 
For some reason the new version shows the time a message is delivered instead of showing when the person has read it. It looks awkward and I absolutely hate it.
I Don‚Äôt like ads. Now my messenger app has ads in it. Very disappointed. Is this a ploy to get us to buy into an ad-free Messenger upgrade?
This face book is not monitored as Yelp does a better job and ridiculous how many situations seen are seriously crazy
I‚Äôve been using the messenger for years but what is it instead of improving, it‚Äôs getting frustrating to use messenger. There‚Äôs no way to look back the media if you‚Äôre sharing some pictures/videos with friends over messenger. It used to be in messenger‚Äôs menu but not it‚Äôs disappeared even if I wanted to look back at pictures if the person is active or not but still can not? Please fix it and I‚Äôll change the ratings!
My app now loads upside down and takes a couple seconds to revert to normal. My screen is constantly locked: so it doesn't rotate by its self. (I like to watch videos in bed so i don't like how it moves on it own so its always locked.) And when i go to close out of my apps running in the background my messenger is upside down.  Everything else seems fine. 
I prefer to see names of those in groups, not Jane Doe plus 2 more. People change profile pictures all the time. When sending something in messenger I want to know going to right group. I do not like update of January 18th in this area!
I haven‚Äôt seen yet a stupidest app like messenger..sometimes it get stuck while I am using it.messges take a lot time to delivered ..a lot of problem I am facing ..easily get disconnected if I call someone..I can‚Äôt done telling how many problems I faced on messenger..hopefully those problem they will fix
I don‚Äôt know if every update makes it better or worse. But this update is definitely a step down. I can no longer see when a message of mine has been read from just opening up the app and looking at the different messages I have with my friends. I have to physically open up the message thread to see if my friends have seen the message. üëâüèªüëâüèªüëâüèª Downgrade!!   Please make messages able to be seen when read again by just opening up the app and looking at the bank of messages one has. 
Ever since I updated my phone, messenger failed to keep up with technology. IF messenger loads, it literally talks 2 and 3 minutes to populate. When I attempt to communicate with my groups, the page locks up. Sometimes it thinks for a few seconds and then shuts down, returning to my home page. SO FRUSTRATING!!! I send an email to Facebook, who never answered.
Messenger has no way to report a hacked account b
It‚Äôs just really and honestly a meh app it‚Äôs amazing way to connect but it will always glitch and other thing so just yeah, meh.
Every single time I delete and download again, it tells me the generic thing, to set me account up and stuff, and I hit the button and it makes me screen go black for a second or so and it sends me to the home screen.
I love messenger so much but everytime I try to log into the other account it says session expired and it always make me re log in it didn‚Äôt not do this until last update please fix it if I didn‚Äôt have this problem it would be 5 star rating I also see other people are having same Problem 
Messengers said I sent to many messages !!! What dose that mean that is what it is for !!! Will never understand why people are the way they are in this world today !!!
I can‚Äôt type more than 5 words in chat before my phone freezes and restarts by itself. It opens happens with this app :(
this app was ok but i would suggest that you should be able to text people at limitless amounts and not have to keep receiving messages saying that you have reached the limit of messages sent. i just got a message like that i was very upset that i have to wait until i can text again
Freezes every time I or someone else sends a gif.
My messenger on my IPhone isn‚Äôt working or loading at all, I tried restarting my phone and I tried deleting the app and redownloading it but it just keeps doing the same thing and I‚Äôve had messenger since the time it came out and I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong.
To much update
Your app no longer has the option for me turn choose whether to show being active or not. I need to turn this off. HELP!!
Nothing will load for the past several days!
With the new update you can longer see if your message has been opened without having to physically click on the chat it‚Äôs self..... that was my main reasoning for using messenger
Makes my phone shut down then back on and it only keeps happening when i use this app.
My love of Messenger is fading. Just getting way too many features. It was better as a way to message friends. No need for the My Day or so many photo options.  Please step it back a bit. It‚Äôs been my preferred way to communicate since it came out. However, friends are not wanting to use it because of the changes. I don‚Äôt blame them.  It‚Äôs not SnapChat. Stop acting like it is.  Oh and please stop changing the sounds and notifications within the app every time there‚Äôs an update or just logging in and out. I don‚Äôt need the disrupting sounds. I opt to turn them off. Do not override my choice by turning them on again. Thanks for your time if anyone actually reads the reviews with suggestions for improvements. 
Trying to install messenger. The page has an ‚Äúinstall‚Äù bar but on touching it nothing happens. Frustrating!!
I go to get on messenger and it keeps telling me session expired plz fix asap its annoying me
My messenger is messed up can you please fix it
Why is there people I don‚Äôt know on Messenger it‚Äôs I accept them I don‚Äôt even know they are . How can I delete them from messenger this just piss me off guess I‚Äôm going to Unstall Messenger I don‚Äôt want people I don‚Äôt know on my messenger
It seems there always  someone on FB posting or someone send you something/video/link through FB messenger. Bye FBA Messenger, you will not be missed. üí©üí©üí©
Why did y‚Äôall take away the mood filters
Since the last iOS update, I can't do messenger on my phone. Major issue for me. I use messenger to interact with work colleagues for work's. Grrr
In my messenger inbox I can only see the time now. I can‚Äôt see that little circle with the check mark or the persons profile pic anymore. What happened??
It would get 3 ‚òÖ, maybe more, for being functional and solid, but the constant prompts for features I DO NOT WANT and personal information piss me off. When I make the mistake of enabling notifications, I get more than just the messages from friends I would want to know about; when I disable notifications, I get constantly hassled to turn notifications back on. I hate an app that won‚Äôt take NO for an answer. This is all clearly baked in to the app ‚Äî annoying, frustrating and insulting, all by design.
Facebook apps are so cluttered and messy. Hate both apps
Switching accounts says session expired and acts like the app just got installed EVERYTIME from today ...so please fix this!!!
When someone is online - seeing that on the top of the screen is just plain annoying. Also don't care for when people were last active, which I feel perpetuates the norm that one must be "connected" at all times.
Me too (previous review)! The person(s) coding (‚Äúnew‚Äùfb) forgot to link identity to active/access and time. I‚Äôve had to create 3 different login ID‚Äôs. I‚Äôm OUT. 
Having to resign in every few hours and being  asked repetitively to give access to my contacts is getting this app deleted
It was bad enough that Facebook littered their site with garbage ads that can't be turned off... then you destroyed Instagram with ads and preferential algorithms. Now I have your ads popping up in my message feed! So sick of the constant advertisements!!
What‚Äôs going on? When I try to get on the app my iPad crashes , and I have to use a hard restart to reboot.
Iphone 8.   Ios 11.       I have your most recent update.  However when i try to send voice clips or make a voice call the other people cant hear me.   I checked my end of the equation by trying my native messenger and making voice calls etc.    my mic works fine on all other apps.   Just not yours.
so frustrating app, hate that face uses this, marketplace is all spam :/ nothing is friendly , keeps telling me turn on notifications!!!!!! leave me alone messanger virus , it should be simple dm chat , less is more !!!!
Really downgraded with this update, really complicated to use
Facebook messenger automatically updated one day then all of a sudden I notice that there‚Äôs no list for the people who are currently online anymore. I usually use messenger while I‚Äôm up late bored so I like to see other people who are online so I can message them and know that they‚Äôll reply quickly. Why take the List away????
who the idiot on drugs that thought it would be ok for game notifications to come through messenger, it‚Äôs gone from bad to horrendous.  now i can‚Äôt even chat with friends.  (words with friends 2 is the culprit, so far) .. as if chain mail wasn‚Äôt bad enough
Messenger isn‚Äôt working so good. It deleted my messages and I can‚Äôt even get them back. Fix this problem ASAP. !!!
Not sure what‚Äôs going on but I‚Äôm unable to connect on messenger via smartphone at this time. Also video chat never rings through just get a missed chat message. I use this app to talk to my navy kids in Japan and am saddened by the poor quality of the app. Please fix this once fantastic app as of now it stinks
I‚Äôm so sick and tired of being logged out every 2 freaking minutes. ‚ÄúLogin session has expired‚Äù what? Do they last only 2 minutes? I‚Äôve just woke up and I‚Äôve already got logged out 6 freaking time. This is terrible. This app is becoming trash. Each time it updates i get logged out more and more often.
Why do we have to download this bs just for fb messages? I‚Äôm literally almost out of storeage.
Each time I want to send a voice memo audio via messenger an error appears.  Ps. Not talking about recording an voice audio through messenger, I‚Äôm talking about my voice memos audios that I have saved in my iPhone on voice memos app. 
This app is excellent but I would love a way to make it so that I don‚Äôt see who‚Äôs active? Or if I can hide certain people? Like I super don‚Äôt want my ex‚Äôs face popping up every time I open the app, you feel?
Update Failed The Messenger has stopped completely
When you are trying to switch account, the Session will automatically expire and then it load the previous account for about 10 mins!!!! This started after this update!
This worked much better and used much less memory on my iPhone when it was part of Facebook. I re-download it occasionally to check and answer messages then delete it again to save space. MAKE THIS PART OF FACEBOOK AGAIN! Also it is not at all user friendly anymore. When I get into Messenger it takes forever going through all the adds for upgrades and extras to get to all I want - reading or sending messages -which is the whole purpose!
You can‚Äôt see if the person got the message unless you open the message.
Please change this back. It‚Äôs annoying and non-substantive. Thanks!
Installed app and carefully selected option to not allow access to contacts. Next day app had a list of people from my contact that I may want to connect to in Facebook. Did not give my phone number and used new empty email account. Cannot believe Facebook is allowed to do this and Apple is okay with this app breaking privacy settings.
Long story short, my friends and I were talking about male pattern baldness.  When i unlocked my phone shortly after and opened facebook, ads for male pattern baldness cures were on my feed.  Quickly deleted messenger and no creepy stuff has happened since:..  They‚Äôre listening 
aesthetically, the app is terrible. no updates for the new iphone X, night shift mode?, what happened to the old emojis?
Basically what the title says. Quick and easy to message people with no bugs or issues.
This app is the worst
Don‚Äôt know what happened but both my husband and I, on separate phones, cannot access our messages or it takes forever to show them. It‚Äôs not our data!!
Every time we turn around you guys want me to put a password in and you want me to start all over then you won‚Äôt do this and do that and it times are you want to start all over I John with it deleted
Be nice to turn off messenger calling if you want too
Can‚Äôt change people nicknames
Mirabal
Great app just miss the chat heads,I wish you would allow them on iOS devices also
Add more chat colors and bit emoji and I am sure you will gain more users. Also allow iPhones to set messenger as their primary messaging app.
I am eternally trapped in group messages. It shows your icon as soon as soon as you open the message. Now my friends think I hate them. So. I never open the thread.
Hate that with the new update I can‚Äôt see if someone read my messages without actually clicking the conversation and opening it.
Just stop with these annoying updates, they don‚Äôt work!!
I don‚Äôt like how the new update doesn‚Äôt let you see what time the message was viewed.
This app needs to be fixed because I don‚Äôt like appearing online and there is no option to appear offline  Actually there is but it doesn‚Äôt work!!! 
...the Facebook experience even worse by splitting it into multiple apps.
Recently, when I try to send pics to my friends, they can‚Äôt see them, despite me being able to, but when I leave and return to the app, the pics are practically invisible. And what I mean by that is, you can see the outline of where the pics are supposed to be, but there‚Äôs no pic, just plain whiteness. And not only that, but every time I return to the app, the outlines of where the pics should be are moved around in random places, and one or two of the pics are still visible, but only to me. This didn‚Äôt happen until I had some Internet connection difficulties, so I don‚Äôt know if this has anything to do with that, like Messenger‚Äôs just not recuperating well after that, but all my other apps that weren‚Äôt working during that incident are working perfectly again. Please fix these glitches as soon as you can.
Why must we install messenger to see our messages when back then we didn't need login into our Facebook account.I don't see what's the point of that.
It was a unnecessary update. I hate the little pencil beside both my and my friends pictures. Then when you tap on the photos the pencil is again in the bottom right corner is annoying. Just put the Aa and the doodle option back in the corner. Plus I am not getting the recent messages. I am being given notifications for messages they sent 1-2 hours before. Please just put it back to the previous update. The most resent one doesn't work. I also Dislike that I can no longer see if my messages were sent or delivered on the right of my messages on the app. Please fix that.
I can never get it to load conversations no matter my signal. Complete failure. Would prefer just to work off of the Facebook app
Whenever i go to switch accounts it tells me to renew my login everytime i switch can you fix this bug please
there needs to be a button where you can delete all of your messages from different people at the same time! it takes too much time to sit there and go through a million people!
Love the app but it really needs an option to logout.
I use messenger to contact people I\'m friends with on facebook when i don\'t have their phone number, so I do like the app.  However, this latest update does not show the last login of people past 1 hour of their log in.  This app use to show at least up to 24 hours of last login which was very nice, especially for family, friends, co-workers etc.  We may not talk everyday but we can at least see that they are ok and active in a 24 hour period.  And, If I can see someone has been active in the past 24 hours, then YES, I\'m more likely to use Messenger!!!!  I also have a son that lives many hours from me and he is very busy with family, job, etc., but if I can at least see where he has logged in within the last 24 hours, it gives me peace of mind that he is ok!  Please give back to us and show the last login of people from at least 24 hours!  Please!!  Thank you!! 
I do not even use on my Phone a constantly Receiving spam messages even after changing passwords over and over! Lots of Issues FB needs to improve this ASAP! 
Hello family and friends what are you doing today I am praying for my Family my Beautiful Son ho have gone to be with the lord Chris L Harrison RiP my Beautiful Son !!
Why should you have to download an entire different app just for you messages? In the Facebook app if you click on your messages, which it has it‚Äôs own icon, makes you try to download the app. It‚Äôs dumb and I protest it.
ÿß ŸáŸÑÿß Ÿà ÿ≥ŸáŸÑÿß
You shouldn‚Äôt be required to have messenger especially if you go through safari
When I try to log into another account it‚Äôll get to where I‚Äôm logged in and then it‚Äôll say you have been kicked out please try again and won‚Äôt load any other messenger.
I enjoy the app I wish it had better setting options though where I could block remove hide people things like that maybe switch my picture so it‚Äôs not the same as my FB pic. Also On skype when you delete something it deletes from the persons end as well not just I delete it and I can‚Äôt see it but it‚Äôs deleted and they can‚Äôt see it because sometimes you send a pic by mistake and you want to delete it and can‚Äôt should have that option in 2018
Why do not I have instant games on Messenger with the knowledge I'm updated Messenger and Alvis
Sick and tired of the app always asking me to turn on notifications EVERY TIME I open it. Why cant it take ‚Äúno‚Äù for an answer? Why do I have to have bright red circles everywhere reminding me to turn on notifications?? FIX THIS!!
I have deleted this app 4 times because of not having the switch accounts option. I am installing again. This is bs
Ever since the new update I can't use messenger for more than twenty minutes without it freezing up and restarting my entire phone! I use messenger for all my contacts. Please fix!
Most of the time audio is choppy and video is laggy and drops the chat. Not my connection, because I have good internet.
I hate it that it doesn‚Äôt work on I watch at all.
There‚Äôs always an update and most of the time nothing even noticeably changes. This time I can no longer switch between accounts quickly. It says session expired and I have to completely input in all the information again. Very annoying.
Stupid that it's mandatory just to talk to someone
This is seriously a bad app. And not surpassingly Facebook made it worse. It now will not shut up about notification. I need it because it‚Äôs the only way to stay in contact with some people other wise it‚Äôs horrible. Does anyone at Facebook actually use their apps?
Ever since the update a few days ago there have been a few different bugs ive noticed. For instance dont try to have multiple or even 2 different accounts, because when you try to login to the others it says ‚Äúlog in session expired‚Äù and take you to a page that is the same as if you were logging in for the very first time. And after it does that the app will unexpectedly close out! üò©üò° VERY frustrating!
I like the call feature, have used it several times, however; We should be able to control who can call me.
I could never hear the person in the other end except for very rarely because of this app like on a phone call with the same device it works but on messenger I can‚Äôt hear them
If they added the way to select messages to erase them, it would be a big change. since many people are unsatisfied with messenguer for the reason of being deleted one by one
I‚Äôll be using the app for about five minutes or less and suddenly my screen will go black. I have to hit the home button and if I don‚Äôt swipe-close messenger first, when I click the Icon again it flashes and immediately turns black again, and sends me home.
problem loading and no worked
I don‚Äôt like it. Now when I‚Äôm on Facebook and want to share a post,it wants me to send it through Messenger. I have to select ‚Äúwrite post‚Äù and leave it blank. You young developers have no clue what you‚Äôre in for in 15-20 years when carpal tunnel, bersitus and rotator cuff hits you. Every click is painful
It‚Äôs every time you log on 3-4 step ‚Äúnot now‚Äù no thank you over and over. Obnoxious is the best way I can describe it. I can turn on notifications myself in my settings. If I wanted them on....they‚Äôd be on.
If it doesn‚Äôt stop asking me since I have already denied 6 times when I installed the app I will delete my Facebook and messenger I‚Äôm sick of it popping up when I open the app it‚Äôs ridiculous
ÿßÿ±ÿ¨Ÿàÿß ŸÖŸÜŸÉŸÖ ÿ≠ŸÑ ŸÖÿ¥ŸÉŸÑÿ™Ÿä ÿßŸÜÿß ÿßŸàÿßÿ¨Ÿá ŸÖÿ¥ŸÉŸÑŸá ŸÅŸä ÿßÿ±ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ ÿ±ÿ≥ÿßŸÑŸá ÿµŸàÿ™ŸäŸá ÿ≠Ÿäÿ´ Ÿäÿ®ÿ∑ÿ£ ÿßŸÑÿ¨Ÿáÿßÿ≤ ÿπŸÜÿØŸÖÿß ÿßÿ±ÿ≥ŸÑ ÿ±ÿ≥ÿßŸÑŸá ÿµŸàÿ™Ÿä ŸÅŸäÿ™ŸàŸÇŸÅ ÿπŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿßÿ±ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ ÿßÿ±ÿ¨Ÿàÿß ÿ≠ŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¥ŸÉŸÑŸá
I don't see why we need this app. Maybe it's a system issue or something, but messaging was better when we only needed our FB app.  On top of that this app practically begs you to turn on notifications. You almost want to so it will leave you alone 
Since the last 2 updates this app has gotten progressively worse, I haven‚Äôt used FB in a couple months because it‚Äôs so bugged with problems. Please fix and optimize before adding new features.
The new update has erased all my messages that are over a week old. Thank god I still have access to them on my laptop but I cannot access them from the app. Not happy with this change at all!!!!!
It keeps making me log back in to my account... I think it has a bug, hope they fix it soon!!
Every time my account disabled for just adding my friends!!!!!
I tried signing in via code generators and passwords, but nothing worked. Even signing in with the official Facebook app failed. Facebook needs to fix this issue ASAP because this affects everyone that uses it.
Won‚Äôt work at all since the new update. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling and now it won‚Äôt even re install.
My accounts got deleted overnight. This is unsat.
After update everytime i try to check massage take like minute to load
don't notify me when some friend joins to "greet them on messenger". now I have to go into the app to mark as read??
What happened to the minutes since active?
Messenger just wanted to force me to grant access to my phone contacts in order to use the app. Uh, no. The fact that there is no way to opt out, only to allow it access and then go back in the app after the fact to shut off the continuous contact synch and instruct the app to delete my contacts... that‚Äôs not good enough. You advertising mf‚Äôers don‚Äôt get to siphon off my contacts and then expect me to trust you that you‚Äôll actually delete them and not use them.   I didn‚Äôt click ok to allow the access, abandoned logging in, and deleted the messenger app from my phone. I‚Äôm pretty close to deleting Facebook entirely at this point. 
I was chatting with a friend via the FB Messenger App. We were doing a survey, not in a group - just the two of us. But, I got responses from others. How were they able to see something that wasn‚Äôt shared? I deleted the App. Now only responding to messages through FB.
I reiterate, simplicity. I want to feel engaged as if I were looking at the person I am messaging. Simplicity.
Support iPhone
When i‚Äôm in a call and it hangs up i can‚Äôt use the speaker anymore and i have to delete the app and re install it again
AWESOME
Used to be simple. Seems like there is something fishy going on since messaging is now it‚Äôs own thing. No longer use it; if someone wants to get in touch with me that bad, text or call me. If you don‚Äôt have my number, there is likely a reason for that. Same goes the other way around.
Too much drainage of battery in iPhone X üò°üò°
I domt want to see who's coming online every time I open the app
So the new update looks nicer then they old but has more adds along with issues when rerouting through links. An example of this is google maps. If someone sends you a location... good luck as google will not new me to find you or even load the map.   Son from a group perspective better use GroupMe if you are going to share locations or places. 
Trash..half the time it‚Äôs just a spinning circle when you open app up through watch, other half you go into convo and it‚Äôs not even updated, message won‚Äôt send, almost like they sit in a queue until my phone unlocks. I‚Äôve uninstalled, reinstalled, everything you can imagine..same thing. And the last two days haven‚Äôt even been able to get to convos, just a spinning circle. I know it is not my watch considering every other app or anything else I use works perfectly like the day I got it. Except Facebook messenger...
So many ‚Äúsession expired‚Äù notices and seems to want total control and knowledge of my phone.
I cant believe how bad I despise messenger anymore. Whats worse is I have dropped the app, just to start it all over again. Im not sure which is worse my stupidity or your bad programming.  I spend most of my time dealing with a frozen screen.
When the app works it‚Äôs great. But recently it crashes every time I open it and I have uninstalled and reinstalled it 5 times yet it still continues the minute I log in to my account
Why would I want a separate app just to send messages?
Get a different app so you can Message other friends zero out of 10
Updated and now I can‚Äôt even use my account. Would love to be able to contact family who I video chat daily that live in Florida.
... broke several things. Constant relogins and getting asked to enable notifications EVERY SINGLE TIME I switch to the app. Every. Single. Time.
I have been receiving harassing message requests for months, and changed my settings to only allow messages from friends. Since updating the app recently, that doesn't seem to be an option anymore, and the harassment has started again. I don't even see anywhere in the app to access settings anymore. The app is garbage. I'm deleting it.
This app is riddled with hacks and scams. There are so many hackers cloning & impersonating legitimate Contacts that I have absolutely zero confidence that I am actually communicating with the person messaging me. So, my only option: I deleted it. I just do not have time for this breach of security and ridiculous nonsense. Very disappointing. 
I would give this application a 5/5 stars if it only had this feature where i can search for a specific message i sent since a while maybe like a year like some different apps like whatsapp where i can search for a specific message no matter when i have sent it, moreover there is another feature where i can add a specific message to my favorites (star it) Please add these features i bet me and many oher users of the app need it , please this is not the first time i submit this request and i have never been replied or had an answer or my suggestion been takin into consideration. Please just read this review. 
How about, NO!YOU CANT HAVE ACCESS TO MY CONTACTS. I speak to one person on this, and I‚Äôve almost got them convinced to use another app. This is sooo terrible. If only because of the way they insist on extortion to gain permissions to things they REALLY HAVE NO RIGHT TO. I can send messages without you secretly recording audio and video at ALL TIMES WHEN THE APP IS OPEN. Think I‚Äôm lying. Reset your battery meter, turn off all apps, leave messenger available, and don‚Äôt use it until your battery is dead. Charge your phone, turn off messenger, turn on your camera, and see if it dies after the same amount of time. I‚Äôm just saying. NO PRIVACY. Like Google, THEY'RE SELLING YOUR INFO, TO BUSINESSES AND TO THE COPS. BELIEVE IT. WELL, THEY‚ÄôRE JUST REQUIRED TO GIVE IT TO THE COPS SINCE THEY ALREADY HAVE OUR PERMISSION TO RECORD IT AND USE IT HOWEVER THEY WANT.
Switching from another account always said ‚Äú Your session already expired‚Äù and you had to re-log in again. Please fixed this thing. Thanks 
Whenever I switch accounts on messenger I have to login again completely. Which I set the accounts up to not have to do that. It‚Äôs highly irritating.
This app is just straight up annoying. I can‚Äôt even check my messages on a computer without having to install this app. It‚Äôs pointless and unneeded taking up space on my phone.
Sounds so bad I‚Äôm not going to update. Sounds dangerous. This sometimes is the case. When they try to make something better but they change things. Then because of what they change. It gets worse. Unless this is s fake update ?
But for seemingly no reason at all, they removed their payment feature that allowed me to easily find ay my friends back the five or ten bucks I owe them for various things when I borrow some money from them. It was such a great feature! Why would you get rid of it!? It makes no sense! You seem to be trying to force PayPal down our throats which charges a percentage of each transaction made! Ridiculous!!
The app constantly harasses you for access to your contacts and other things. I HATE IT
I have updated the last version and why I do not have it
I have gotten two messaged from people who were hacked recently so I deleted Messenger.  Reinstalled it.  How are they being hacked.  Is it through Facebook?
I have a few accounts and I used to be able to switch between them easily. Now I‚Äôm constantly being logged out. It‚Äôs very inconvenient!!!
This application lacks a more intuitive interface particularly in managing messages.  Uses would enjoy managing and filing messages in a more efficient manner.  Perhaps archiving and a way to delete multiple messages would prove to be more efficient
Stupid app taking up more storage.
I also don‚Äôt know how mine & Paul‚Äôs pictures got reversed but they are. Confusing.Confusing
Every time I try to switch to my other account, it just sends me back to the original log in page to my main account! Please fix this.
Messenger serves a good purpose, but it doesn‚Äôt empower the user to reclaim their privacy without potential hurting friendships. Inmean, do I need to see a person‚Äôs post on their Facebook page and then on my inbox as a message? Wouldn‚Äôt that be too much togetherness? Wouldn‚Äôt it not silently piss me off? How do you stop this without bluntly breaking the news to friends that you don‚Äôt want to extra love coming your way or you don‚Äôt want be in the chain-gang that pushes messages along? Messenger needs to find a way to stop this madness. A way that will not insult friends. Until they do, this App is a one star for me. How about a ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù option?
Switching between my person Facebook messages and my school Facebook messages always says error
I love the voice feature
i got the most updated app and it doesn't show me all my messages
I accidentally archived an important message thread and now there‚Äôs no way I can remove it from the archived conversations. Please make this an option.
At times annoying but still pretty useful
Ads in Messenger? Are you f***ing kidding me? Instant delete once that cr@p started
App works ok. Would like background option on task bar ? üòä
I love it you can call ITS Amazing GET THE APP
Esta app es s√∫per me encanta, solo que me da errores porque tengo el IPhone 4S, pero aparte de eso esta s√∫per.
I know you guys probably won‚Äôt care but can you fix the profile picture? My friend updated his profile picture and the app is still using his old one even thought I logged out and re downloaded the app TWICE! I know it‚Äôs a small problem but still it bothers me because it would show his picture and then set it as his old one...annoying...
Every upgrade is worse than the upgrade before. Can‚Äôt comprehend why they don‚Äôt test it before they go live.   Dates and times are often wrong. (Basic stuff isn‚Äôt even tested properly.)  In the last update, if you upload a picture or sticker, you can‚Äôt see when the person saw what you sent. If you press the comment, picture or gif; the response should be consistent ~ just common sense programming.   Instead, if you press the picture, you don‚Äôt see the time it was received, it brings the picture into the screen.  Instead, if you press the gif, you don‚Äôt see the time it was received, you get advertising for a bunch of stickers you really don‚Äôt care about on the screen...   Whoever does their testing does a horrible job, it‚Äôs probably programmers, because most programmers can‚Äôt test software well. 
I enjoy Messenger.  The only drawback I have is having to erase each and every post and forward one by one.
I don‚Äôt have words for how much I‚Äôve used Messages to chat to my family, loved ones, friends, so on an so forth. But there‚Äôs a very bugging issue coming back all of the time. Simply put, my messages don‚Äôt arrive at their destination, and my friends‚Äô messages to me don‚Äôt get sent to me. And I know it‚Äôa the app and not something else for sure. Please update and fix this problem, which was non existent a couple of updates ago. 
Application keeps disconnecting and reconnecting and then locks me out and disables account for no reason tried of having to submit appeals.
I use it daily. Rarely has issues.
Forced to download to read messages. Zuc wants all access/permissions to your phone. Always delete after reading all messages.
Habr√° que checar la app
This is a weird and absurd update. Why do i have to enter my phone number? Thats weird. I shouldnt have to enter my number to get to my msgs. Weirdos.
For some reason can‚Äôt see android gifs only using my iPhone.
Used to hate it and saw no value And now It‚Äôs awesome 
It‚Äôs so easy to use and video chat with friends
Continuously crashes.
Where is the invisible button?
Since the latest update most of my messages from last Wednesday to September 2016 what happened to all of my messages? I‚Äôm getting real sick of this crap!
I‚Äôve had some problems in the past around 2015 but it‚Äôs been perfect now. FaceTime and texting is awesome. Keeps me connected with my family and friends. Love this app.
The recent download update is trash . It crashes & then kicks you off of it . Hate it .
May be the way I see thing makes a difference when a rate some things. To rate five stars an app is not only the number of features in it but the easy operation, the clarity
Whenever i call my Friends I don't hear any sound coming from my phone. Please fix it.
Messenger worked just fine, then Facebook decided to require I upload all my contacts outside of Facebook. I refused to say ok, so then I wasn‚Äôt able to see my messages on the app anymore. I looked into it again and Facebook says I can delete the ones I don‚Äôt want on their sever and change the setting to not automatically upload, but if you delete all, they will upload then all again. I have over 2000 contacts business and personal. I‚Äôm not going to go though and sort them out for Facebook just to use messenger, so I have deleted the messenger app from all my devices and will never use it again until they cease requiring access to all my contacts.
I updated messenger today via the App Store & now ads are popping upüò°üò°üò°. I can‚Äôt find out how to stop it. I‚Äôve emailed fb support, hope they answer me
Yes Indeed
I like this app
Worst app we have no choice but to use it
I like Messenger , especially when I'm traveling overseas or when friends don't have phone service but have wi fi. It's just landed me texting except you use wi fi instead of phone service. I like me it when I can call/receive calls from overseas for no charge
So why don't I delete this app? FB has convinced people I communicate with to use it.
It keeps crashing and kicking me off only gets 3 stars for I have never had a problem before
Stuck in loading... App won‚Äôt open. Looks like an update may have messed it up.

I‚Äôm not turning on notifications. Stop telling me to turn on notifications every time i open the app. It makes me want to turn them on even less.
Perfecta para comunicarse con la familia  Amigos y empresa  High Level app 
En las video llamadas no siempre es buena
Since the latest update it crashes on startup and takes forever to load.
Every update seems to bring bugs with it. Lately, I‚Äôve discovered that message requests from people not on my friend list keep reappearing after I‚Äôve already deleted them. And I tried sending a voice memo through Messenger since it was an option but it kept saying ‚ÄúUnable to send‚Äù. Please address bugs and just leave Messenger alone rather than always trying to do new things with it. Thanks.
The latest review you guys sent out removed the little circle showing that the person you were talking to has read your message. It was super convenient to know that the person has read the message and would be replying to it soon. If you can bring the bubbles back, that would be very greatly appreciated. Thank you!
It's the only way I talk to people
I can say it's my most used app in keeping in touch with family and friends. It definitely has come a long way with its updates. Love the sticker features, being able to communicate instantaneously with people. Love how they added games, you can send or receive money from someone, order an Uber or Lyft. Make a voice call. The only issue is there video chatting feature; it's still glitchy and either works or doesn't. Hopefully they will eventually get a fix to it!
It keeps saying the session expired and I have to religiously all the way back in the messenger every time
So. Me and my boyfriend stay on video chat a lot. And whenever I click on a picture on messenger it restarts the app and says call failed. Y‚Äôall need to fix this. I‚Äôm tired of it hanging up on him. This is a crappy app & I‚Äôm tired of it. Either fix the app or I‚Äôm going to skype thanks :)
I use this app all day everyday! This app has helped me to stay in touch with friends and family all over the word!
Simple and easy.
This app now features ads in your message list. I guess I was not getting enough ads in regular Facebook so I needed to see more spam.
Why should I be forced to download a separate app to use a feature that‚Äôs on the original app and the website. Going to google hangouts
Can you update that so you can customize it for more than 24 hours. It would be great to see a feature that you can select the range of days yourself. It‚Äôs very annoying that I have to go into the app every 24 hits to select do not disturb or a log out button would be great too.   Marlon 
Stop asking me to invite people on messenger that I already have. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I was hoping for Facebook messenger to listen about my complaint on editing texts and zooming in texts to make it easier for the speech bubbles when I translate photos. But no even with the update that just came out today they still didn‚Äôt fix it!! ‚ÄúFacebook messenger makes sure to update to fix all the needs of our consumer‚Äù more like you‚Äôre full of crap! Facebook you better update it where it‚Äôs back to the way it is back when it was easier to zoom in on photos and edit!
Good
I‚Äôm giving it one star because it doesn‚Äôt have any ‚Äúundo‚Äù option. Like any other messaging app it should have a option for deleting text that has not been seen yet .
Such an ordeal to send codes here and there to set up. Chill out. Give an option to see this on the web. I could never get a code to my phone so I miss work info and social events. No customer service.
am no longer able to type in messenger after like2to4characters;only way I‚Äôm able o use it anymore is in order to call somebody;it‚Äôs horrible..smh
I hate to have two apps for this one service.... I just keep downloading and deleting this app for having it in the phone will drain battery. And I can‚Äôt log out.
Is anyone going else having a difficult time using messenger on your Apple Watch? This is ridiculous.
Deleted it within 15 minutes of downloading!  Repeatedly asked to access my contacts on my phone and also to push notifications.  You can say ‚Äúnot now‚Äù but not no!!!  Also hard to tell whether text was from Facebook or my regular texts through Apple. Apple texts are private but FB isn‚Äôt.   Don‚Äôt do it!! 
Was at least a 4 star, but not now... I use messenger quite a bit, but don‚Äôt like in each update it‚Äôs the same generic explanation of what the update is. Not a fan of ads...  Yes I can ‚Äúhide‚Äù the ad, but annoying that it comes back from time to time And I don‚Äôt like that the little notifications on whether ppl received/read the messages are gone unless you go into each conversation... Again, annoying... And if I knew that is what the update was going to do, I wouldn‚Äôt have updated.. This is like Facebook itself anymore... Every update just makes things worse... 
Whoever made these latest changes wiped out my entire contact list and conversations. DONT DOWNLOAD THIS!
Horrible update turns the screen side ways and does not change with the built in giro-scope. I dislike this, the update makes it very hard to type while the phone is charging. Please do something quick to fix this issue, thank you! 
It‚Äôs not a bad app to use. I mean I do use it to stay in touch with people to the outside world. But the downside is that it takes up too much storage on my cellphone which is a real pain in my gears. As Peter Griffin says on family guy ‚Äúthat really grinds my gears‚Äù why can‚Äôt there be an app that connects all the messenger apps into just one app?
Keeps telling me session expired every time I switch accounts. Never had an issue until the update today. Plz fix it and stop updating if it doesn't need to be fixed
Facebook messenger is a crappy app that allows the people that work at Facebook spy on you, people READ THE TERMS OF SERVICE, you give up all privacy when you install this app, phone calls, recordings, videos, cameras, are all buged, your messages and pictures, all can seem, Don‚Äôt be fooled!
I love this app but every once in a while, my messages won‚Äôt send. It‚Äôll say ‚Äúsent‚Äù but it‚Äôs not actually sent because it doesn‚Äôt have the blue check mark. It‚Äôs really irritating. Also, my shared photos won‚Äôt open sometimes. Please fix.
Why does the description for each update have the same statement every time it makes me think you‚Äôre lying and not actually fixing anything you should put the reason why your updating it instead of the basic acting thing you do of acting like your all about your customers when you really don‚Äôt and get away with it by just putting the the stupid oh we updated our app every two weeks to help you but why? What‚Äôs the helping it you can update something and still make it worse so can‚Äôt you specifically tell me what your doing to the app so I know or not if it‚Äôs worth keeping
App seems to get worse every time an update happens. It won‚Äôt let me type.
There should be an option to log out and there isnt
When I say ‚Äúdisable notifications ‚Äú please respect that. Please stop telling me that my notifications are turned off. Please stop putting a red badge as if there is something important to look at. I do not want any notifications from messenger and I only use it when I have time and want to call someone or text someone. I really hope Apple makes a rule where you aren‚Äôt supposed to annoy and nag notifications disablers
Still a terrible idea to force users to use messenger app. All because someone was too lazy to program the mobile site properly... Messenger app also requires you to keep it updated in order to even function. I only use it about once a month, and it is usually less of a pain to just go to my desk and use that instead of dealing with messenger app.
Used half my battery for some light texting on i7+. Re-Uninstalled.  Absolutely absurd that I can‚Äôt check my messages from the website! Further, some messages don‚Äôt even show up on the desktop website thus making this miserable spyware adspam app the only way to see messages from people who aren‚Äôt friends! Apple needs to allow force desktop site and circumvent this garbage.  Allegations of constant ad/ mic spying seem valid, and I can‚Äôt seem to disable mic access in settings. The app itself now has ads and constant bombardments of PEOPLE YOU MAY KNOW! It isn‚Äôt 2008; I already know everyone on FB. 
Recently there was a crazy problem with my iPhone and the Facebook messenger app. I was only able to type about three words before the input would freeze! I came to the App Store after dealing with this problem for less than a day, and WHAAALA they released a new update.   Problem solved!!! Great job! I use the app on a daily basis and I appreciate the quick attention to these random bugs. 
Where are my photos?!!! üò°
This app is a great way to message friends and family! There has never been any problems with it at all! And it has a new update where it had face filters you can use! Great app.....
Yes it is helpful in some ways but it‚Äôs just basically horrible. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre trying to copy Snapchat and it‚Äôs really bad. Like just understand your NOT SNAPCHAT!!!!!!!!!üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°ü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Ø
Stop trying to spam us with dark patterns and feature creep. Tell us what we get so we might actually update.
There‚Äôs a comparability issue between the current version and the Apple Watch
There are glitches  Right now my keyboard from my iPhone will stop typing after the first 2 letters and hang up in the messenger  I can leave voice messages though   I can type fine everywhere else so the issue is not with my keyboard 
The little circle that shows whether something is ‚Äúdelivered, sent, read‚Äù on a message. Typically when I open the Facebook messenger app, I can see if something is ‚Äòdelivered vs read‚Äô just from looking at their name/message without clicking on the message to open it. But now, for some reason that icon is missing on the main feed. I have to actually open a message to see if it was ‚Äúdelivered vs read‚Äù. That option to see should be seen right when I open the app, not clicking on names to see individually if it‚Äôs been delivered vs read. Extra things that are making the app less efficient.
App is poorly streamlined for battery life. A 2 hour video call on a 7 plus will give you less than  2 hour call on a fully charged battery. I‚Äôd hope that they fix this but will not hold my breath
Having to have my notifications clear is an obsession, this crap app won‚Äôt let me clear my notifications, I hate Facebook anyway so since I can‚Äôt message without messenger guess I‚Äôll delete that app as well, BYE Felicia!! Besides iMessages is so much cooler with the Animoji‚Äôs.
As indicated in subject line, this app just freezes and crashes a lot.   It‚Äôs more interested in reminding me to turn on features I do not want to be active. Like notifications, for example.   Awful app. 
I don‚Äôt want notifications. Here‚Äôs the app flow  Turn on the app Message:Please turn on notifications.  Me:Not now. Message:You‚Äôre on messenger! Turn on notifications! Me:Not now. System alert:Continue without notifications? Me:Continue without notifications  System alert:Please turn on notifications! Me: Not now Forever: every. SINGLE TIME I I see the message screen: SYSTEM ALERT: PLEASE TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS  GOOD LORD. I get it, you don‚Äôt want me to not get constantly sucked back into using the app. This is still a terrible, aggressive experience for the customer. 
I don‚Äôt want an entire separate app simply because ppl decide to send invites to candy crush. Facebook takes enough space on its own and and additional app for messages is ridiculous.
After the most recent update I have not been able to type full sentences on messenger. I have to send the unfinished message and start a new one to continue what I was saying.
This version of messenger doesn‚Äôt work worth beans. I‚Äôll be typing, and it just...won‚Äôt. I have to back out, then go back in, sometimes after every word. Annoying beyond words.
It worked great until the update. Very buggy. I hope it gets fixed soon!
Whenever my phone is on the messenger app the screen never goes off after a minute. Stays on like I have the setting on *Never* please fix.
I was messaging a friend. I had to send the message in several different messages. Not happy, you need to fix this!!!
I use messenger almost every day. When I send a receive a gif it often freezes up. Today totally froze my phone it took me five minutes to be able to shut my phone off. I hope this issue gets resolved soon.
Only reason why I rated 2 stars is because I love the app but Facebook can definitely do a better job in letting people know what th changelog is. not just ‚Äúwe update the app every few weeks‚Äù that is not informing people what is different about the new update.
The app updated yesterday and now I can‚Äôt type a full sentence without it freezing. I keep having to save it as a draft and close out and reopen. Please update this again and fix it. Other than this it works pretty well for me.
Why is messenger locking up after I type a few words? Any info to fix appreciated
It just started last night but I‚Äôm only able to type a couple words before it won‚Äôt let me type more. Then I have to close the app out and go back in and type a couple more before it stops me again. Seriously the most annoying thing when you are trying to chat with someone on Messenger. I‚Äôve tried running updates and reloading the app and it‚Äôs still doing it. What is going on?
I‚Äôll write about 3-4 words and it just won‚Äôt let me continue. I‚Äôve reset my phone, the app, and Facebook multiple times. Buggy as hell. Unusable at this point. Needs to be fixed.
This app is incredibly glitchy. My keyboard freezes and won‚Äôt let me type out messages 75% of the time (it works on other apps, so it‚Äôs not me) and kicks me out all of the time. It‚Äôs really annoying.
This app now freezes when typing a message. I have to go back and forth to type a one-sentence message. I‚Äôm not using this garbage until you fix it. Unusable.
Every time my phone autocorrects a word as I'm typing, the entire keyboard will freeze on the app. I can‚Äôt type anymore. I can‚Äôt backspace. I can only just send parts of messages at a time. I had to turn off autocorrect for the app to work properly, which is ridiculous.
Every since the update My messenger keeps locking up!!!Sometimes can only typed two words at a time what is going on hereüò°
I have to use messenger pretty much everyday and it‚Äôs always so buggy! Yesterday it quit responding to the keyboard after a few keystrokes. I have to back out of the message and go back in in order to continue with my message.
Having multiple issues with responses can usually only type a couple words and restart it or send and do it again
When you try to log into an Instagram account it always says confirm your phone number but it never sends the code or does anything just gives you a pop up saying you need to confirm it with nothing to give you.
I had a FB account & when my new iPhone was upgraded,  FB said I had to open a new account!   Now I‚Äôve lost a lot of my contacts on FB & then they pop up on another FB which of course was the original one.  How can I combine both accounts?????????     Since I can‚Äôt get ahold of someone to help me on FB,  it‚Äôs very upsetting!!!! 
Every time I get a message and try to respond back, the app will freeze up on the keyboard to where it won‚Äôt let me type. I‚Äôll get two words typed and then it freezes. I have to click back and then re open the message to continue where I left off.. Extremely frustrating
For more than 2 weeks it is not working
Why on earth would you make it so that every time I tag someone on something on Facebook it sends a freakin message through this stinking app?  If there is a way to turn that off or stop it please let me know cause it is absolutely maddening!!!
Every time something autocorrects while typing to my friends, the keyboard freezes and I have to back out of the message and go back in to make it work. Very annoying!
Since my review will not post because it doesn‚Äôt say anything good about this app or company, I hope people who ever used this, never does. Please use an app non affiliated with Facebook! I‚Äôm only using for certain family members or I‚Äôd never use this! And it‚Äôs a reinstall because their consistent upgrades make things worse!!! Ugh!
It‚Äôs slow as heck, and after deleting and reinstalling as well as restarting my phone, it‚Äôs still giving me issues that no other app on my phone does: it won‚Äôt space and the keyboard freezes when I try to message someone, and it does it quite frequently.
I‚Äôve been having a problem logging out of being active for the past few days and I can‚Äôt seem to get an answer about what‚Äôs going on with the app and this needs to get fixed ASAP cause this is ridiculous.
I can‚Äôt type more than a few words in Messenger before my keyboard becomes unresponsive. Only app that ever happens in.
How can I erase my PM‚Äôs ?
The new update or something doesn‚Äôt work. Can only type about 15 letters then the keyboard stops working and can‚Äôt delete what I typed
So the new app update I get only write one word. or back out of Messenger and write another word or use my talk to text but it‚Äôs having major issues.
Every time I use the suggested word, the screen locks. I go off the page and back on to continue typing. It even locked with autocorrect.
Whenever I‚Äôm in the middle of typing a message to someone it just stops completely. I have to go out of the app and go back in to continue writing. Sometimes I have to do it multiple time for the same message and it‚Äôs really annoying please fix!!!
Okay Facebook, whatever update you just did just messed up the messenger. You can only type so much before it automatically stops and forces you to send in order to type again. Please fix ASAP!
The new update won‚Äôt let me type more than a few words per line in a sentence. It then freezes. I have to type a word or two at a time in order to finish a sentence. Please fix!! Thanks.
I updated yesterday and ever since, I‚Äôll start typing and it‚Äôll stop and freeze the keyboard and I‚Äôll have to go back and forth multiple times to finish my sentence, I restarted my phone and reinstalled the app but it doesn‚Äôt fix this üò¢
Why in the world would there not be an easy option to delete unwanted messages? Crazy. When I tried to google how to do this, Wikihow gave me a 14 step process (no lie! 14 steps) that included going on my computer and downloading a Chrome extension. Why????
The last update is buggy. You can‚Äôt type more than 3 words in the iPhone App and then it stops. Test your platform before you send it out!!!
Literally won‚Äôt let me type or erase anything after it autocorrects a word. What the actual f???
There‚Äôs always bugs not worth having. It always lets me type a couple words and then it quit and I have to back out of the conversation to keep typing. Frustrating and not worth it.
I start typing a message and it freezes aft r a few words and I have to exit the conversation and go back in to get the next few words. Don‚Äôt recommend artless until this is fixed.
I use this app to talk to a few people regularly and most recently every time my autocorrect catches a word it freezes my keyboard and won‚Äôt let me type anything at all. I have to close the app completely and reopen to finish my message. It also happens if someone sends me a message while I‚Äôm typing. About threw my phone across the room last night trying to message my boyfriend an 8 word sentence.
The app keeps freezing stooping my text input. Very annoying.
Ever since this latest update my app is freezing on keyboard.  Having to back out and come back in. Making it difficult to type messages.   Happens about every 4th word.  Also not allowing quick insert of information from predictive.
I love this app but as of two days ago it‚Äôs been lagging. When I say lagging I mean it‚Äôs been stopping mid type and won‚Äôt budge for like 15-20 min and then you come back and type one more letter then it stops again like it‚Äôs freezing on you.  I refresh the app by closing it but then it‚Äôll just pick back up and do it again after a little bit. 
Since the latest update, I type only about four words before it freezes and won‚Äôt let me type anymore. Since I use it to communicate, it is basically a worthless app now
I can‚Äôt type more than one word at a time without logging out in between words...I‚Äôve reinstalled the app twice hoping that would solve the issue.
Started acting up yesterday. Asked other friends if they have the following issue and they too reported the same problem.   When keying in words, it‚Äôll allow anywhere from one to four or five words to be typed then it freezes up not allowing you to type more text or delete what‚Äôs already been entered. You either have to send what was typed out and continue with another ‚Äúmessage‚Äù or shut the app down and start over. Very annoying problem. I‚Äôve deleted the app and reinstalled several times but still no fix. What‚Äôs up Facebook?? What‚Äôs the issue?? Where‚Äôs the update?? This is getting old fast! 
Every time my phone auto correct corrects something or adds an apostrophe I have to exit the chat I‚Äôm in and re-enter to be able to type further.
Doesn‚Äôt load, messages from Facebook users that are not my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù have to be looked for. Not very user friendly.
Keyboard becomes unresponsive when entering text in a message. Makes app near impossible to use.
When I try to type in messenger it only lets me type a word or two then stops
I love the app but every time I go to text a message it only lets me type like 2 words and then it freezes and doesn‚Äôt let me type anymore. Can somebody help?
Every since last night my messenger would keep acting up. Like I would be in the middle of texting and it would stop typing I keep having to refresh it. A lot of other people are having the same problem. Please fix it !
Cmon
Just wanted to say the new update is poor!  Can‚Äôt seem to complete a full text without having to exit the app and go back to texting. Seems the app has gone down hill. I use this app a lot with touching base with friends and customers. Please fix!
Please fix! When I try to type a message to someone it will type out half of it and then freeze. The only way to continue is close the app out completely and start over. Only to be hit with the same issues as before. Very very frustrating!!
There is an annoying red circle with a 1 in it on the top left of my screen in the app. This is because I haven‚Äôt turned notifications on. I do not want notifications from this app. It‚Äôs irritating. Get rid of the red circle. I know I don‚Äôt have notifications on. Thanks.
I‚Äôm trying to type a message and it keeps freezing. I literally have to go back to the summary of message threads then click back into the message I want and type a few more words before it freezes again.
The keyboard stops working a few seconds after I start typing. It‚Äôs not my phone because it only happens on this app.  Also, this app has too many things and it‚Äôs really annoying. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if later, you are able to upload pictures and videos to your ‚Äúwall‚Äù and only visible on this app. 
I updated my messenger yesterday and now it stops typing. Any help would be appreciated.
In the latest version of Messenger they decided to arbitrarily limit the amount of characters to allow in each message. Often cutting me off at only a few words until I have to force quit the app and reopen it. Incredibly frustrating.
Every time I try to send a message it freezes and I have to exit, type the message in my texts, copy and paste into the messenger. It‚Äôs really inconvenient.
5 stars from me & my husband too,Kim Fowler.  Keep it up?
Tried to troubleshoot but it's not letting me type all of my message in Messages it stops me after the third word
Issues with being able to type a message and when typing the message locks up and your can‚Äôt do anything
Just recently I can‚Äôt type anything past a couple words. Have to back out of the chat windows and go back in, only to be limited to a few more words. Tried uninstalling/reinstalling. Nothing! Frustrating!
iOS problem: iPhone 7+ AND iPad 4th generation both will let me type 25 characters or so before freezing up. The fix to get it working for the next 25 characters is to exit the app and re-enter again. Obviously this is impossible to use for live chat.
If I could give Zero stars I would. Facebook really dropped the ball on this one. I can‚Äôt even type a message to someone on messenger. I can type two words then it freezes. üëéüèª
This changes all the time and always has glitches. Right now I can type one sentence and then it freezes up where I can‚Äôt type or delete at all. Nobody plays the games they have and they are trying to be like Snapchat, twitter and Instagram all in one app. Just keep it simple for messaging. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm trying to doü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Please leave a message issue : very loud  When you call someone, if it goes to please leave a message mode, it makes big loud noise  please a message sound . Very loud , not good for office setting and home  Please fix this issue 
Keyboard keep freezing after one or two words. Most aggravating thing ever
Messenger freezes my keyboard after i type out from 1-4 WORDS and then it stops typing down what I want it to written down and the backspace won‚Äôt work. I have deleted the app and reinstalled it and it still does the same thing! If I were to rate this app once more, I‚Äôd rate it LESS than one star. THIS DOES NOT WORK IN 2018!!! üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
Every time I try to type out a message on fb messenger it only limits me to one word and then I can‚Äôt type anymore. I have tried turning my phone on and off, logging out of the application as well as deleting and downloading the app twice.
So, with the most recent update, if my phone corrects a word, it stops accepting typing input.  I have to force-quit messenger to get it going again, and since it‚Äôs my primary method of communication with my housemates, that makes it hard to get anything across.  Fix your buggy app, and I‚Äôll rewrite my review, but for now, it‚Äôs borderline unusable.
You can‚Äôt hire a decent dev team to create a functional app
i‚Äôve been coming across a problem where it stops letting me type right in the middle of the message and the only way to fix it is to close out and reopen the app ands it‚Äôs super frustrating
Fix the keyboard issue!! Every time I got to text it closes out!!
Both my iPhone X and my iPad Pro are experiencing the same bug in which you can type a few characters and then it will not accept anymore keyboard inputs at all. Even after force closing the app. How does something like this even happen?  Kinda defeats the purpose of the app if it doesn‚Äôt work and you have to go to a laptop. 
Everytime I start typing to someone it gets like 3 words in and then it stops working! The words I‚Äôm typing won‚Äôt show up and it stops typing in general. I‚Äôm then forced to get out of the app and go back in.
Since the last update. I have been able to finish sentences in the app. Very frustrating.
For some reason messenger won‚Äôt let me write complete sentences on my IPhone 6plus,this problem started 1-17-18
A new issue I'm having with messenger the keyboard freezes and doesn't let me type I'm ready to send all my friends my number and abandon the app all together they need to fix it or I'm out. And I've had Facebook since 2011
It is not working right. I can only type one word at a time. It keeps freezing.
Every time I forget an apostrophe or on a word, the whole text portion (both keyboard and where it shows what you‚Äôre typing) just stop working, making it to where I have to back out and constantly go back into the convo and start typing again. I‚Äôd say on average, I have to back out and go back in about 4 or 5 times per message(for long messages that is, and about once or twice for shorter messages). Just really frustrating to be honest. Please fix
We are not able to type more than a couple words before it freezes up. I‚Äôve tried deleting the app, turning my phone off, nothing works. Please fix this!
Can‚Äôt type a reply to messages 100% anymore since updates. I have to keep closing app and going back in. I thought it was my phone but then I tried on my iPad and had the same problem. Frustrating!!
App is not letting me type more than two words.
My messenger keeps not letting me text after I text a couple words. I will go to type and nothing will happen. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs stuck, but I can hit send and then it sends the message. But I can‚Äôt type again until I hit Send.
Can only type a few words at a time, then it gets stuck!  Can only retake a photo once before app force closes 
Im trying to find a trouble shooting area, as of 1/17 at night the keyboard stopped working in the messenger application. Works everywhere else in my phone. So there must be a bug happening? Can this be checked out.
With the new update on the iPhone 6s you can only type one word then you gotta leave chat then re enter to type another word it‚Äôs the worst of your trying to write a paragraph
Every time I try to type out a message on my messenger, it‚Äôs like my keyboard just quits! I can get two to three words typed out then nothing & have to close the app completely out & reopen it over & over until I‚Äôm done just to type out one little message. I know it isn‚Äôt my phone acting up because my keyboard doesn‚Äôt do it on anything else but my messenger.
Every time I go to text and a message on the Messenger it‚Äôll freeze it and I won‚Äôt be able to back out I won‚Äôt be able to do anything I have to actually close the whole application and go back into it again just to get the application to unlock the keyboard so that I can continue writing my message app iPhone 8 plus Verizon
On occasion text stops being added so I have to leave the app and go back to finish a message or send it chopped up what‚Äôs the deal
Sometimes when I film a video in messenger, it'll add a random filter whether I like it or not. Please stop that.
Not only me but everyone i know just today started having a problem where the app will decide to not let you type anymore when you are typing. You also cannot delete your text. Quite odd
I can only type a word for two before messenger freezes and I have to close out go back and continue typing takes me 5 minutes for a sentence fix this bug !
After today‚Äôs update I cannot type more than 2-3 words on a message until I have to exit out and type more words to continue my statement.
Update sent out on 1/17/18 freezes the typing portion of the app if you use an autofill word.
ŸÉŸäŸÅ ŸÜÿØŸäÿ± ÿßŸäŸÇÿßŸÅ ÿ™ÿ¥ÿ∫ŸäŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿØÿ±ÿØÿ¥ÿ©
It stops typing and I have to close app out very much a issue
Whenever I type the blinking bar on the screen quits blinking and it freezes up. I can keep pressing buttons on my keyboard but after one word in the bar it won‚Äôt let me delete or add anything else. It sends it, but I have to send one word at a time. It‚Äôs a glitch that my other friend with iPhone said she has the same issue too
It will not let me type a sentence or 3 words at a time !! I uninstalled it and installed it and nothing please fix it !! Thank you
Every time I start to type out a message it freezes and I have to restart to continue my sentence.
I‚Äôll start to write a message and all of the sudden, it won‚Äôt let me write anymore. I won‚Äôt be able to backspace either, the cursor will just stop. This happens after just a few characters, or after a couple sentences. It doesn‚Äôt seem to matter. I‚Äôll have to quit the app, clear it from my history, then log back in to type any more. Sometimes I‚Äôll have to do this 3-4 times for just one message. Very frustrating. Please resolve this issue.
I can only type a couple words then it won‚Äôt let me finish, same problem with commenting on Facebook. I‚Äôve tried uninstalling both, still didn‚Äôt work.....please fix!!!
When I open messenger and try to reply to a message, I type one or two words, then it decides to not type anymore. Frustrating!
Since this latest update I‚Äôm having trouble typing a message all the way through without stopping. After a word or two the messenger freezes up and I can‚Äôt do anything but leave and return to finish the message. After a few more words the messenger freezes up again.
Hello I‚Äôve just updated the Messenger app and now I cannot type more than half of a sentence before it stops letting me type or delete letters. I‚Äôve turned my phone off and on, and it‚Äôs still the same.
I've been using messenger for a while now but recently I start to type and it just doesn't let me type anything else randomly. I'll be typing and nothing is coming up. Very frustrating.
I hate being forced to use this crapplication. Can‚Äôt even copy/paste, emojis are garbage, and makes the Facebook experience terrible. ONE APP PLEASE FACEBOOK WE DONT NEED 10 different ones for each thing
When I am typing messenger no longer accepts what is being typed I have to back out of the thread and then go back into the thread and keep typing where I left off. This happens on my iPad Pro iPhone X and even my Apple Watch! Please make a fix posthaste
For some reason my keyboard keeps freezing while trying to type in this app. It didn‚Äôt do that at all before the update today. Please fix this‚Äîthis is super annoying. I can‚Äôt type more than five words at a time.
Every time I try to message someone my keyboard acts up it still pops up but when I try to type something it doesn't show up I have to leave the conversation and come back just to type a couple words before it acts up again plz fix asap
Seems like I can‚Äôt seem to be able to type more than a few words before the keyboard completely stops working, and I have to leave the conversation, and come back in order to finish what I wast saying in one post. Update bug?
I‚Äôve never had a problem with this app before but ever since today my keyboard will stop working but only on Facebook messenger and I have to leave the conversation and then go back to it for the keyboard to continue working. Super annoying.
so there‚Äôs this glitch that I‚Äôll be typing a message but only one word would get typed and like you would keep on typing but nothing pops up! Needs to be fixed
I don‚Äôt know what has happened but messenger won‚Äôt let me message anyone without having to shut down the app after only typing a couple of words. Have to open it back up and type two more words close it down again. It‚Äôs frustrating!!! FIX IT!!  It was working fine and all of a sudden boom acting stupid!
I updated the app and now it freezes every few words and I have to reopen the conversation to continue typing. Please fix this bug soon. iPhone 6s running current iOS
With the latest update messenger randomly stops allowing text so you have to get out of the message and go back.... several times... so annoying
Fix it! Whenever I use text replacement I can no longer type my messages üí©üí©üí©üí©
Zero complaints with Messenger until the latest update today. My keyboard will stop typing every few words and I have to exit the app to the home screen and go back in to resume finishing my sentence.
The messenger app won‚Äôt let me type full sentences. Freezes after a few words. Have to leave a message and go back to continue typing. Stupid app
I can‚Äôt even type 2 words without having to back out of the message to type again it blocks my typing on every message
I‚Äôve been using the app and up until today not had any issues but now I know multiple people who‚Äôve been telling me they can‚Äôt type more then a few words before having to close the app and start typing again and it‚Äôs kinda ridiculous updates are supposed to make it better not worse
I can only type a few words when it freezes up. Restart and type another word- so frustrating.
I can only type 2 or 3 words then the app freezes and I have to open and close and still can‚Äôt type! PLEASE fix this.
I downloaded the update today and now every time I try to type a message the app freezes and I have to leave and come back to it.
Junk
Please fix this problem. I‚Äôve reported it twice
It‚Äôs been glitching with the new updates. The keyboard becomes unresponsive after a few words. Fix!!!! Please!
Got a messenger update today and downloaded it and now when typing in messenger it freezes up every 2-3 words! Have to close app and reopen. And get 2-3 more words and freezes again! FIX THIS!
It's great to keep in touch with family and friends. But, I've had to reload it a few times because of issues. It would stop typing after a couple of words, so I would have to keep backing out of a conversation, just to finish what I wanted to say and it would drop video calls when service was just fine.
I could start typing a message and it will just stop. It won‚Äôt type nothing else. WTH?!
As I write a message in your app, the app itself freezes up ugh.
Every time I try to type out a message it keeps freezing and I have to back out and go back in to continue it because it won‚Äôt let me do anything. It happens multiple times in just one message. Please fix this I‚Äôm getting frustrated!
Why do we have to download Facebook Messenger when we used to be able to do it all from the base Facebook app? Bring back the good ol‚Äô days!
Stops typing mid sentence
Freezes my typing. Have so back out of convo and go back on to try to complete my sentence
There seems to be a bug that makes it so that it stops letting me type after putting in a few words it‚Äôd be great if u can fix that. I‚Äôd love to give u guys 5 stars
Can you fix the problem with the keyboard, whenever I type something it just stops working.
Never had a problem with this app. But as of lately, I can‚Äôt finish my text without refreshing the app
Calls are dropped constantly, I don‚Äôt get notifications, messenger freezes, currently reinstalling after an uninstall to troubleshoot why the app won‚Äôt let me type more than 1 word before it stops and won‚Äôt let me type or delete anything.
It won‚Äôt let me type a whole sentence, it‚Äôs not my phone it‚Äôs Facebook messenger, makes me type 1-2 words and have to send it so my sentence is broken into like 10 different messages. I tried restarting my phone and all. I can make full statuses on fb and I can comment, please update this crap. Lol
The app lately will not let me type... I tap what I want to write and it will not dictate... so I have to send broken messages. Sooo frustrating!
I‚Äôm not sure if anyone else has had this same problem. But recently (today) I have started to notice that there is an issue when it comes to typing messages. Before, I was able to type out sentences. Now, I can‚Äôt even spell two words without the sentence interrupting me! It also won‚Äôt let me go back and delete things! I have to exit out and go back several times just to finish my sentence.   Please fix this! 
I‚Äôm not sure what happened, but my keyboard stops typing after about 5 characters. It‚Äôs extremely annoying and I would like a solution on how to fix this. I‚Äôve already deleted and downloaded the app, and restarted my phone as well. Please send help.
Every time I try to use messenger it won‚Äôt let me type a complete sentence and i have to send and finish it.. I have an iPhone X.. fix the issue! Thanks!
I've never had any sort of problem with messenger until today. Every time I try to type a message, my keyboard pops up, and after typing a few words it no longer puts what I type. I can't even backspace any mistakes. This drives me crazy and it's only a problem when I type a message on messenger. I don't know if anyone else has a similar problem but I hope y'all fix it soon.
I can't type more than a couple Of letters without my messenger refusing to type anything else even though it shows that I press the letters. I keep having to exit the app every few words and it's getting insanely annoying. Already tried deleting the app and restarting my phone and it doesn't help. Please fix 
My keyboard works perfectly fine on every app but recently it WILL NOT WORK on messenger, it types a word to three words then stops and won‚Äôt let me delete, type anything else or anything. It‚Äôs not my keyboard because on every other app and everything else when I type it does not mess up. I deleted the app twice and restarted my phone too and it‚Äôs still messing up. Fix the problem please I have important things I need to talk about with people on Facebook.
Myself and multiple friends are all having issues with it suddenly freezing up our keyboards and not allowing us to type.
After the most recent update for some reason my messenger app doesn‚Äôt want to let me write full sentences when messaging people. Not sure what‚Äôs going on but I‚Äôm currently trying the whole ‚Äúdelete the app then re-download it‚Äù thing to see if that helps.
I type a few words then it autocorrects something and poof nothing. Cursor won‚Äôt move. Only app this is happening to. iPhone 6s iOS 11.2.2. Not sure what you broke but app is COMPLETELY USELESS NOW.  Fix the autocorrect bug.
Not sure if it‚Äôs just an iPhone X thing, but when you begin writing a message. It stops adder writing 2-3 words. Fix it please.
Latest version has a keyboard freeze that persists through force closing the app. Have to leave message and come back in multiple times to form a sentence.
When I go to write my reply, I‚Äôm able to write about two words and it won‚Äôt register my keyboard. I have to write it out, and copy and paste
I have been using messenger for as long as it‚Äôs been out. Now I‚Äôm having more trouble than ever with the new update! I can‚Äôt type more than 3 words without it stopping and not typing. I keep having to exit completely and go back in multiple times until I finish my message.
Tonight I‚Äôve noticed and others have commented that iPhone users are having issues with messenger. Please fix. üò©üò©üò©
All I expect from this app is the ability to text my Facebook contacts. But they insist on adding features such as video chat, gifs, etc. And it‚Äôs obvious that the developers don‚Äôt know how to handle this. The app crashes so frequently and my messages don‚Äôt go through consistently. Very disappointing
Updated today now messenger is messed up! I can only get a few words than it freezes. Wont backspace, delete, nothing on my ipad.  Did not update my iphone due to fear will mess on my phone ‚òπÔ∏è
I've just recently started having some problems where I try to type a message but it only allows me to type a few words at a time before freezing. It won't even let me erase them sometimes either. I've never had a problem like this before and its incredibly irritating. I've tried reinstalling the app several times, but it doesn't change. I hope this gets fixed soon.
I use this app a lot but since the last update I‚Äôve been having a problem where when I type, after a short number of characters it just stops typing. I can‚Äôt even backspace.
I love this app but recently i can‚Äôt seem to type more than a few words before the app goes dead. No issues in other apps. Please look into and fix
Keyboard freezes every couple of words, and I have to swipe out of a conversation and come back in to continue typing. Very cumbersome and annoying, didn‚Äôt have this problem before the update.
Please fix messenger. Iphone8. Can‚Äôt type but 5-10 characters and then keyboard freezes! Boooo üëéüèº‚≠êÔ∏è
Usually have no issues but for some reason lately Messenger is having a huge glitch and every couple words my keyboard stops typing and it makes sending messages extremely annoying! Fix it PLEASE! It is only happening using this app, nothing else!
I can only type two words at a time. Very frustrating!!
Wish I didn‚Äôt need this app, but if I have to use it, can‚Äôt they make it work?
For some reason my app will stop typing after 2-3 words unless I switch to a different conversation and switch back
Updated to latest version and now it keep on crashing when I'm texting friends.
Running current version, 148, on iOS 11.2.2.  When I try to type a message, it freezes every few sentences.  Won‚Äôt let me type more, can‚Äôt delete- just stuck.  If I back out one step to the inbox and go back in, whatever I‚Äôve typed is still there and I can type again, but only for a sentence or two.  Restarting my phone hasn‚Äôt helped.    I‚Äôm going to try deleting the app and re-downloading it. 
It‚Äôs not allowing me to type in messages. It‚Äôs not my phone because as you can see I‚Äôve written This with you with no problem you guys need to fix this
A few friends and I are having trouble writing messages inside of messenger recently. It seems to only be an IOS issue. Every time we try to write more than a few words we have to exit the conversation or reboot the app in order to continue the conversation. We have to switch to a new messaging app until then
Very often at random points while I'm typing, the keyboard will lock up and not allow me to operate it in any way. Only way to remedy this is by closing the app and reopening, to which the problem arises seconds after. I can't use the app. Please fix.
The app is messing up! I can‚Äôt type full sentences I need to keep leaving the conversation and going back to it in order to even put a space! You can type like two words if that then you can‚Äôt type anymore. FIX THIS PLEASE!
Several times, I‚Äôve gone to type a response to my friend, and the typing will just stop normally after I use the letter I. Fix it!!
I‚Äôm trying to type, & I literally have to exit out of the app each time I try to send a sentence.
Ever since the update, there‚Äôs been a lot of bugs. My keyboard is not functioning in this app thanks to the new update. I would be in the middle of typing a small message and it will suddenly disable itself from typing. The camera features is still a work in progress, I get it. But somehow it still mess up with the orientation of the camera.
I can only type a few words before my keyboard freezes. This only happens in messenger.
My friends and I are having major issues w messenger.  The space bar keeps locking up and you can only send a word or two at a time in a message
Everytime I try to message back my friends, I can only type a few words and then exit the chat, enter the chat, and finish my message. Please fix the app.
This application keeps limiting my messaging. I go to message someone and it takes me five messages to write one full sentence. It just is not letting me complete my messages before it even stops typing on its own. Once it gets to this point I cant even backspace/erase what I have typed. My only option is to send. I have tried resetting my phone and deleting the app. Nothing is working. Very disappointed.
It was working perfectly fine but now I can even type a complete sentence without it freezing on me ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è please fix
Will type 1-4 words then the keyboard becomes unresponsive only in that app Leaving the app and coming back buys you 1-4 more words 
Every time they update, they screw up something new. This new update freezes after typing 1-3 words. You have to force close the app and re open it just for it to do the same thing again. I‚Äôve deleted and reinstalled and restarted my phone. Nothing is helping. And the Facebook app isn‚Äôt much better. Constantly freezes and then it‚Äôs crashes, HOURLY!
All of a sudden, Messenger is being stupid. It will only let you type one of two words and then the cursor will not advance. No matter what key you hit, nothing else will show up. If you back out of the page and then go back in, you can type one or two more words before it freezes again. Please fix it!
I only use this app to talk to one person. Because they only have messenger. However I can hardly type more than 3 words before it doesn‚Äôt let me type or backspace or anything I have to send he message to keep typing which is annoying bc instead of sending one message I have to send like 7. And it‚Äôs not just the phone bc my keyboard doesn‚Äôt act that way using any other app. Fix it please.
Ok so whenever autocorrect corrects me on messenger, messenger pretty much freezes. I‚Äôll still receive messages, etc. But it won‚Äôt let me type anymore. At first I thought it was a glitch on my phone but it‚Äôs only happening on messenger. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not explaining it well but I‚Äôm trying. Pretty much autocorrect = not letting me type anymore. (Btw it started today I‚Äôll update tomorrow to see if it fixed)
For some reason, messenger will only let me type 3 or 4 words at a time before freezing. I have to close the app and come back to it. Just for it to repeat the same thing.  My phone is up to date on all software. So I don‚Äôt know what the problem is. 
Hello I noticed recently that after I type something and it autocorrects I can‚Äôt type anymore and the only way I can fix it is by closing and reopening the app and I know it‚Äôs not my phone because it works just fine in other apps, if you could find a fix for this problem ASAP that‚Äôd be great, it‚Äôs annoying to have to close and reopen the app every time there‚Äôs an autocorrect
Can only text 2 words at a time WDF 
My keyboard only freezes in this app. It doesn‚Äôt let me type nor Than 3 words. And I have to keep reinstalling and uninstalling it.
It works pretty well. I have no issues with it.  Love it.
As of right now when I am in messenger typing a message it stopped me after about three words and it won‚Äôt let me continue or delete what I had typed I have restarted my phone multiple times and it still does the same thing please fix this
When I‚Äôm typing a message after the first word it just stops typing, I can continue typing but no words pop up. I have to go back and then open up the conversation to continue typing. Can you guys please fix this.
Keep freezing within the message window.
My app will freeze while I‚Äôm typing and I have to close app and reopen to type a couple more words then repeat
My only concern is that my keyboard keeps freezing up and it really annoying can u plz get that fixed
All of a sudden I can‚Äôt type on this thing it stops allowing me to input characters but doesn‚Äôt freeze. Fix it yo!
I‚Äôm not sure if this is happening to anyone else. But when I message people, it‚Äôll let me type a few words at a time and then it won‚Äôt let me type. My keyboard is still being used but nothing shows up üò≠üò≠üò≠
Keyboard doesn‚Äôt pop up sometimes and the update lags a lot
Messenger keeps freezing - fix it guys - it‚Äôs a nuisance
Every time I go to respond to someone it will only let me type a few words before it‚Äôs completely stops and doesn‚Äôt let me type any more I have to close out of the app and re open it to continue or I have to send multiple messages
My app worked fine up until the update. I can‚Äôt even type a message in the chat box üò¢
I will be typing and I‚Äôll get half way through what I‚Äôm saying and it just stops, I can‚Äôt backspace erase video chat nothing!! It‚Äôs really aggravating when your fianc√© is moving away and your trying to talk to her and make plans be for she leaves and I‚Äôve never had this problem before and I‚Äôve use messenger for years now and I love it but I think you all have a technical issue with it now causes stoping me from finishing my message. Please fix the issue and thanks for your time.                        Sincerely, Joseph R. Williams 
FACEBOOK Messenger has always been excellent until recently where I‚Äôm texting and then it just stops me from texting out more words. I have to back out of the app just so I can type more words which is annoying. PLEASE fix this issue Facebook Messenger!
The newest update makes it so when autocorrect is used, the keyboard freezes. This appears to only exist in Messenger and frankly I'm not even sure how you mess that up.
This app. It is terrible! As of right now, I can type approximately three characters before the keyboard stops responding. PS: I‚Äôm not having this issue with any other applications (I was able to type this on my phone without incident lol)
The app doesn‚Äôt need to be updated and t won‚Äôt let me write a complete sentence.
I‚Äôll be typing a message and it freezes the keyboard. And it‚Äôs not the phone because it still lets me do whatever else, but won‚Äôt put the letters from what I‚Äôm typing. But as soon as I send it? It lets me type again but only a certain amount. This is really nerve wracking.
Anyone else having issues of messenger freezing or stop typing of the screen nonstop?
HATE, HATE, HATE Facebooks Messenger!!!üò´
Latest update makes it impossible to use. You time 2 words and it freezes
My messenger keeps freezing when I type and it will stop in the middle of sentences, not allowing me to delete or even type.
Ever since the update it won‚Äôt let me type to reply back to my messages it keeps on freezing up the keyboard every time I try üòí
repeatedly having to back out to type in chat. it‚Äôs the equivalent of a space bar stuck on a physical keyboard.
I only can type 1 to 4 words before it freezes. When I go back to home screen it works for that many again.  Tried resetting. Still broke
Messenger is in permanent crash state. I‚Äôve uninstalled. Reinstalled. Uninstalled. Reinstalled. Support link is the eternal sunshine of the frontal lobotomized mind.  Senseless rant? Yeah, well, senseless app. I don‚Äôt understand that either. It should get fixed. 
Now it‚Äôll only let me write one word at a time then I have to restart.  Takes forever to write a sentence.  Even restarted phone.  Can we please get this fixed???
Whenever I type something it freezes mid sentence and I am forced to send an incomplete message so my conversations go like Hey ma Man what‚Äôs Up  It‚Äôs so annoying update please 
Every time I type, it stops mid way in my sentences and it won‚Äôt work until I quit the app! It comes back again after I send 2 text messages
After the latest update , I‚Äôm having a lot of issues with typing in the text box. It will let me type only one or two words and then I can‚Äôt type anymore. The cursor blinks and I can ‚Äúgo back‚Äù to the apps main menu so the whole app isn‚Äôt frozen, I just can‚Äôt type. If I reset the app I can type a few more words and then it stops again. Then I reset the app. I‚Äôve restarted my phone and deleted and downloaded the app and it‚Äôs still doing it. It‚Äôs super annoying/frustrating
New update freezes the keyboard after a word is autocorrected. I have to close the app and reopen it to write again. Extremely annoying bug that renders the app unusable.
Photo albums all missing from 2013-2007, one album specifically missing from 2017. Newest Apple update and subsequent Facebook update and hundreds of pictures missing! I am livid!
My keyboard keeps glitching but only on messenger. It freezes and I can‚Äôt type. I have to close messenger and re open it and then I can type a sentence and then it happens again. Please fix this!
Typing is really screwed up now. Pls fix.
I usually never have a problem with messenger, but lately I will be typing and then it will just stop showing what I‚Äôm typing and I have to exit out and reopen the app to finish sending my message. It‚Äôs starting to become really annoying
Can‚Äôt type more than two words at once!! Fix it! Update needed!
Since update I can‚Äôt type more than 3 words a sentence. It forces you to start new sentence after 3 words plus it doesn‚Äôt allow you to make corrections. Really sad please fix
I am using an iPhone 6s with the 11.2.2 update and the most recent update of the Facebook Messenger app. Within the last hour I have run into several issues with the keyboard no longer allowing me to type. I can back out of a conversation, go back in, and it will let me continue for a few words before stopping again. Other times I have to hard reset the app, only for it to continue another couple words before stopping again. Either way, the problem is consistent and needs to be addressed. I have deleted the app and redownloaded it to no avail. I am also not having this issue with any other app. I will change my review when the problem is fixed.
My messenger when I try to send a message it doesn‚Äôt let me type.
These last few days since Messenger updated, believe the update was about a week ago, I‚Äôll be using the app how I always do and suddenly my keyboard will stop working, I am using the iPhone 7+ and no other app seems to do this. I can usually fix it by closing the app and restarting it completely, problem is the extremely tedious task to do this several times while typing a single sentence.
Messenger now won‚Äôt lemme type a message without stopping mid message and not letting me type. I have to send 15 messages for a message that should have been sent in one.
My messenger is super buggy. I need an urgent update! It‚Äôs not letting me type and keeps closing after every sentence.
Currently having issues with writing friends back and only able to type 2-3 words sometimes more but mostly 2-3 words at time. I‚Äôve never had issues with the app before the current update. üò≠üò≠üò≠
Hey Facebook, I (we?) understand the challenges of the iOS 11 debacle...but Facebook chat intermittently ceases to respond to typing as at the app version 148.
Everytime I type, it won‚Äôt let me continue typing
This app is horrendously glitchy. I have not gone more than a couple of months without encountering a problem with it. Ugh.
In messenger app, every time I type something it only allows me to type 3 words then doesn't allow me to type anything else, I must send the 3 words before getting to type anything else.
So apparently after the update when I‚Äôm typing out a message, it freeze right in the middle of me typing out a sentence..
Won‚Äôt allow me to write anything more than a few letters. I can see the cursor blinking but it does nothing when I tap to type, not sure what‚Äôs going on.
Not sure if anyone else is having this problem but the keyboard stops working in my chats. It‚Äôs super frustrating and makes it impossible to use. Otherwise I like the app. Kind of losing interest in it now.
So I was just on messenger, everything was all okie dokie, nothing like major. I mean this app is sh** but I mean it lets me talk to most of the people who use it so it‚Äôs whatever.   An hour ago, it doesn‚Äôt even let me type full sentences, and I can‚Äôt even delete what I wrote it‚Äôs like the chat freezes and is forever in this freeze bull crap. So yeah. Please fix your sheet 
It lets me get 4-5 characters in and stops if i go back to my list then back in then it‚Äôs ok for 5 more characters. My Facebook account is deactivated and only using messenger If that‚Äôs needed for debugging
I‚Äôve never had a problem with messenger and then all of a sudden I can‚Äôt type two words without the whole app freezing üëéüèº
My texting capabilities have bent glitching and I feel that it‚Äôs unacceptable I‚Äôm highly un happy with the app.
I know people always say ‚ÄúI never write reviews.‚Äù I honestly don‚Äôt. I have been having the most annoying problems with this app the last couple days. I can open it and read messages and such, but it WONT let me type. I type out one word and then the app freezes. I did delete the app and then redownload it but it didn‚Äôt fix anything. I‚Äôve never had any problem with it in the past.
I can‚Äôt finish a sentence before it stops letting me type!
It won‚Äôt let me type an actual sentence. It won‚Äôt let me type half way through a sentence. And it won‚Äôt let me hit backspace if I spell something wrong. It just started today. Please fix it
If there is tech support...I have no clue where to find it, which is why I‚Äôm giving only one star. For whatever reason when I‚Äôm trying to type a message the message box freezes. The keyboard is not frozen because I can still see and hear it working. I have to back out of the app. Swipe it to close it out. Go back into the app and attempt to finish my message. I might be able to type one word or a whole sentence before it happens again. I know it‚Äôs not my phone since it‚Äôs not happening anywhere else in any other app. I‚Äôve tried restarting my phone. I‚Äôve also deleted and reinstalled the app itself and still have the same exact problem.
So I‚Äôm trying to type messages and it only lets me type in a few words and then it just stops. It doesn‚Äôt let me do anything else I have to exit the app or go back and come back in order to type again and once again just a few letters and again . . . Ugh ! So annoying ! Please fix !
It‚Äôs hard to make plans with friends when you have to keep swiping up the app and coming back in to finish talking
I like how we can change the chat colors...  but I like to change them more often than my friends do.  There should be a way that I can change the color ONLY for my chat and my friend can keep their color!  I'm annoying my friends by changing the color every other week. 
I can‚Äôt type more than a few words without my keyboard locking up in the app now. I have to close out of the app & open it back up multiple times just to complete a conversation. Fix this!
I‚Äôve been having difficulty texting on Facebook messenger and it stops typing all of a sudden I have to keep closing and reopening the app it‚Äôs a waste of time
Every time I try to send a message, the text box freezes/stops tracking every nine or so characters. To send two sentences, I have to fully close and relaunch the app five or six times. Looking forward to a bug fix.
Everytime I type something it stops typing and I have to exit out and come back and it stops again.. so I can‚Äôt use messenger until you guys fix this miserable issue
It doesn‚Äôt let me type. It‚Äôs only lets me type one word and that‚Äôs it freezes. I have uninstall this app two times already and it keeps slacking. Please fix
They keyboard keeps freezing on fb messenger
iPhone X  iOS 11.2.2  Keyboard freezes after a few words. Have to press send or exit out chat to unfreeze the keyboard, just to have it freeze again after a few words.  Uninstalled four times; restarted device twice. 
Can only fix by closing and reopen app
When I am typing a message to someone I have to consistently back out of the conversation and go back in to continue to text, with that being said the app will stop texting when my autocorrect goes into effect as well when I am typing certain words ( for example: I, it‚Äôs, that‚Äôs, etc..) this just started happened since the update went underway. Maybe there is another way to fix it but I haven‚Äôt been able to find it.
It won‚Äôt let me type properly to my friends and randomly exits
I can‚Äôt type on the app. The app constantly freezes
Every time I try to send someone a message it messes up it does a couple of words the it won‚Äôt let me type anything else or delete it can anyone help me
Ever since the new update I cant type more than a few words at a time and even then sometimes it only lets me do one. Very unhappy
My keyboard is glitching out. It lets me type a few words before the whole keyboard becomes unresponsive. It works fine everywhere else EXCEPT this app. Please fix!
Anyone else having trouble with Messenger only letting you type a few words then it freezes so you have to force close the app and reopen to continue typing? It‚Äôs annoying the hell out of me.
I try to update as often and as quick but it seems like every update there is there‚Äôs always a bug, the latest update has a bug that keeps you from typing
The keyboard on my phone works fine for everything else, but going into messenger it will let me type 1-5 words then locks up and no matter what I press it won‚Äôt work, then I have to go out of the message and go back in and rule another few words and it does it again. Tried to delete and re-download and it keeps happening. Not sure what‚Äôs going on but please fix!
Having continuous problems with the messenger keyboard registering what I am typing. I have restarted phone, I downloaded and re-downloaded app. It will let me type the first word and doesn‚Äôt show the rest of what I type..... FRUSTERATING!
After the newest update the keyboard stops working after typing a word or two.
As of Jan17, sometimes the keyboard will just stop working.
Glitch since I last updated now my keyboard freezes randomly when trying to type a message!!!! Fix please!!!!
It freezes up and doesn‚Äôt work for some reason
Any time autocorrect fixes a mistyped word, or adds punctuation, keyboard functionality is broken until I leave the conversation and re-enter it. Totally unusable currently on my iPhone SE
Not sure what happened, but I can‚Äôt type more than a few words before the app freezes and the keyboard stops working.  This just started today (January 18, 2018) and is making the app unusable.  I hope it‚Äôll be fixed quickly.
It‚Äôll let me type two words and then will freeze for no reason. I have to get out of the message and back in to it in order to keep typing. Talk about annoying.
It‚Äôs only letting me type a few characters to one on all my messages right now
If y‚Äôall can put out another update that‚Äôll be great. I can‚Äôt type a sentence at all without it freezing up and not letting me type anymore. It‚Äôs getting annoying, I‚Äôve tried exiting out and getting back on but it‚Äôs not working and I even shut my phone off and it still wouldn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôd be very happy if you would put out another update so I can type in peace lol
Every time I try to text someone it gets buggy and doesn't put in the text I try to put in the keyboard.
I can‚Äôt type anything in messenger on my iPhone X using iOS 11.2.2. I only get a few characters then I have to send the text before I can finish my message. Please fix this ASAP.
Idk what was done but now I‚Äôm having issues with typing my full message it causes my screen to freeze for only that ... only done this since ive updated the app ... please fix this ASAP
I don‚Äôt know what this last update did but it needs to be fixed. If I wanted to limit my response to my friends and family I would just use Twitter.
Trying to type messages and it keeps freezing up. Have to go back to the home screen and then back into the message
My messenger app won‚Äôt allow me to type! What‚Äôs the point of the app if I can‚Äôt even type?! Please fix!
iOS 11 and messenger are a lot alike, both junk!!  After update and reinstall of messenger app, same issue happens where I am unable to type after a few words, which makes the messenger app completely useless!! 
I used to rely on messenger to communicate with friends and family but last few days the keys stop working after a few words and it‚Äôs not iOS cause my texting is fine. Facebook should have enough developers to fix this.
I write a message through messenger it doesn‚Äôt allow me to write a whole message it stops after about 15 characters I have to force close app every time for it allow me to message someone
This bug showed up today and in a few of my friends‚Äô apps as well. While we‚Äôre typing, suddenly the cursor freezes and we‚Äôre stuck at whatever we were at before. Restarting the app doesn‚Äôt help. Restarting the phone doesn‚Äôt help. We can send messages in bursts like I Uhm This Isn‚Äôt Working But that‚Äôs just stupid.  Sometimes it‚Äôll even let me send a sentence! But that‚Äôs rare. Please fix ASAP. 
I updated about a week ago. Tonight the keyboard would only let me type 2-6 words before it would freeze. I thought it was my phone but I can type on sms and have been typing this review without issue. This needs another update.
Whenever I try and type something it will stop me mid sentence and I can‚Äôt type anymore it‚Äôs happening to all my friends we restarted our phones, deleted, and downloaded the app again and the glitch is still there we can‚Äôt text each other pls fix
Messenger just keeps freezing up on me. I can‚Äôt finish typing anything before it stops me mid sentence. I have to close the app and reopen to continue typing. It‚Äôll do that to me each time. It‚Äôs so annoying. Works fine on my iPad. I have the iPhone 8. Fully updated. The app is also fully updated. Restarted my phone, uninstalled then reinstalled and it‚Äôs still doing it.
The glitches in the app are making this app go down hill. The updates only seem to make the glitches worse. I wish this app would improve because it‚Äôs great otherwise to connect with Facebook friends. We shouldn‚Äôt have to have glitches in just messaging people. It does happen but not this often. Please improve!!!
On every message I send, after typing a few words it seems that my keyboard quits working. I have to close the message and open again and start typing. And then it happens again. I've reset my phone and made sure I didn't need an update. But it's only in the messenger app that does this to me
iPhone 6s Plus every time I go to type a message on the app to someone it freezes at three words! I have to constantly reopen the app...
I cannot even type a complete sentence anymore without it freezing and having to press send after a 2-4 words approximately.  Please fix this bug soon
I‚Äôll start to text something and it won‚Äôt let me finish my texts.
There‚Äôs a major glitch where I‚Äôm unable to type either one word per bubble or up to 3 words. As in I would type & I couldn‚Äôt backspace nor space forward besides being able to send the bubbleüòë
I‚Äôve had Messenger for years now with no issues. Whatever happened with my latest update caused it to stop working. It freezes, won‚Äôt let me type, won‚Äôt let me edit. Completely useless now. Deleted and reinstalled. Hard resets. Nothing works.
When using an (iphone) and it‚Äôs autocorrect feature enabled, the messenger app does NOT respond well to it, Example, typing up a word and letting iphone automatically autocorrect it leads the keyboard in messenger unresponsive, no matter how many times you tap a different letter it will not type Unless you hit home on messenger and go back to your message, please fix this issue.
When I use my messenger, it always start not letting me type a long sentences on it. When I typed on messenger, it started to only type 2 words on it, may you guys please fix messenger thank you.
Having issues with the messenger. It only allows me to type just 2-3 words and stops on me. It‚Äôs only the app because everything else is workin just fine on the typing part. It‚Äôs with anyone i try to message. Anyone else having this problem?
Billion dollar application here and the keyboard doesn‚Äôt work when I try to message people ?!! Seriously
Since the new update I can‚Äôt type more than 1 word. üò°. I have to keep going back in and out of the app.   At this point the app is useless.  Please fix this
Glitches all the time. Pointless updates that clutter the menus. People want simplicity. Not everything needs to have 100 options.
App is horrible, the last update has sent it right down the tubes. Having major issues responding to messages which is a huge problem as I use Facebook Messenger for both professional and personal purposes. Horrible and unacceptable. Facebook needs to step up and fix their horrible mistake.
The latest version is not functioning well. Typing area freezes every few words I type, all the time. I had to close the app and open up again to type the next couple words and then it freezes again!! Please fix it.
Current version keeps freezing while typing
If you could fix it so I could type more than three words that would be great I‚Äôve installed and uninstalled and sometimes it works and sometimes it dosnt.
Every time I type a message to someone, it stops typing anything as soon as I type the letter (i) don‚Äôt know why but it‚Äôs really frustrating and I want a bug fix
Ever time I type it doesn‚Äôt register the letters or number. Huge bug making it quite annoying for friends.
When I‚Äôm talking to someone it glitches and i can‚Äôt type anything else so i have to send what i wrote in order to continue anything else
I love messenger to connect to people I don‚Äôt see a lot of the time but an issue I‚Äôm having is I will be typing but then it just freezes in mid sentence which pisses me off really badly so that‚Äôs why I gave it four stars
Ever since the last update it locks up the typing of messages and you have to close the app.  Sometimes to type one message I will have to close and open the app four or five times. You would think Facebook would have better programmers
Might fix some bugs or keyboard, first time I got messenger it worked as I expected but later when I would start typing, the keystrokes would stop responding and would no longer spell the words that I would type. Which happens every 5-10 words. It is not my phone because I have tested it on instagram, Snapchat, Facebook  keyboards and there was no problem so my logical guess would be the app itself. It would be great if this problem would be solved it is quite annoying to  annoying to quit messenger every time that problem occurs. Thank you
Stops letting me type after it auto corrects a word
Ever since the new update, whenever I try to type, I can only write like a word or two before I can‚Äôt.. I have to always force messenger down, reopen it, type in another one or two words, and the process starts all over again. Please fix this because I never had a problem before with messenger, and I use it to message most of my close friends.
For some reason I can‚Äôt write more then three words at a time. This is annoying when trying to have a conversation
This is the first time that I have had an issue with messenger but it had suddenly started to freeze up and not let me type. I have to shut down the app every few words, in order to keep typing!!! Very annoying and frustrating!!
Can only type a few words and it freezes and you can only press enter to continue to type
This does not work does not let my type all my messages hope you can fix this quick
I have been using this app forever. 5+ years. Everything was working fine until now. Whenever I type to to send a message. It would like stop typing but I could see my keyboard is working fine. I would have to close the app then open it up again and finish what I was typing. It is annoying. I‚Äôm hoping it is a bug. Please fix this! I use this as my main communication with my friends and family!
Every time I attempt to type a message the app freezes for about 20 minutes. I‚Äôve Uninstalled and reinstalled it again and it fixes nothing.   This is the only app I have this issue on.
New update is halting my messages midway. Having to shut down the app and resume it.
It‚Äôs really annoying! I‚Äôm trying to talk to someone and my app stops typing mid sentence, forcing me to get out of the message and go back in, multiple times!!
I just got the latest update yesterday. Now I can't figure out how to make myself inactive. It us to be when you clicked on the people button, you could see who was active and there was a green toggle switch to make yourself active or inactive. But now when I click on that, it shows me a list of suggested contacts and the toggle switch is gone. I don't always want to appear active. How do I turn off my active status now (this is on messenger app for iPhone).
Facebook messenger keeps freezing, and it won‚Äôt let me type more than two words, and then won‚Äôt even let me delete. I have to close out app and reopen it. Now trying to uninstall and reinstall.
i have to quit the app in order to type a message. very frustrating to have to quit (sometimes force quit) and re-open the app just to send a sentence of five or more words.
After every two or three words it won‚Äôt let me type anything else or delete what I typed. It‚Äôs aggravating!! Fix it!
I cannot type more than about 3 words before it becomes unresponsive to my typing. I have to shut out of the app and come back in to type more and continue doing the same thing over and over again. It‚Äôs very inconvenient. :( please fix ASAP! I have business to do!
I can‚Äôt type messages without having to back out of chat window and going back. Keep having to go back and forth, back and forth. Hard to explain with typing. Can type full sentences and everything with all my other apps. Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Tried turning my phone off and on. Nothing is working. Please fix.
Since the latest update I can only type a few words then the keyboard stops working. It‚Äôs frustrating because I have to completely close the app and restart and when needing to send more than a few words it‚Äôs inconvenient
The app locks me out of the keyboard and i can‚Äôt use it. I have to exit into the menu of. The app and then re-enter the chat room to complete the Text.
I no longer like the app on the iPhone! I go to type full sentences and it would only let me type one to two words, it‚Äôs so annoying. I have to keep clicking out of it and going back in to finish typing.
This wasn‚Äôt happening until tonight, but it‚Äôs already getting on my nerves and needs to be fixed. I can only type a few words in a message before my keyboard stops working and I have to close and reopen the app just for it to MAYBE work again. I tested my keyboard in every other app and it doesn‚Äôt have this problem so it‚Äôs clearly the Messenger app that‚Äôs causing this. This is very inconvenient and needs updated as soon as possible.
I type a few lines and it freezes every time mid sentence. I have to back out and open again to finish. Running up to date iOS on iPhone 7 Plus.
Trash....I can‚Äôt even type anything after a few letters. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone who values their time or their friends. I‚Äôll just stick to Snapchat.
It only lets me type 1 or if even possible two worlds n I have to sent the message in order to send another word. I have an iPhone X but another person I know has a iPhone 7 and is having the same issue. Please fix thanks.
Gay.
17 January 2018  On messenger, I try to send a message..I can type one word, then it locks up. Can't go forward or backwards. Can send that one word. Then try again, getting the same results. It's  Like This To  Send A  Message Please fix this glitch asap. It's only on my iPad..on my cell messenger I don't have that problem. Thanks for your quick response. 
My keyboard just started messing up all of a sudden. Works fine everywhere else except on messenger. Fix this ASAP!
I use this app daily to talk to my boyfriend and out of nowhere it won‚Äôt let me type more than two words. It‚Äôs not my keyboard because it works fine on everything else. Please fix this.
My keyboard will just up and stop working while in the messenger app, I have to kill the app and restart it to get it to work again where I‚Äôll maybe be able to type a word or two and restart the whole process
Can‚Äôt type more than two words before the app freezes and you can‚Äôt type at all. Close the app, reopen and you can only type 2 more words.
The newest update screws my keyboard controls into not working anytime autocorrect activates. Extremely annoying.
Ever since the most recent update to this app, it doesn‚Äôt work properly.  When trying to type messages the message freezes.  You have to back out to the contact list and then renter the message to continue typing.  This happens constantly.  Please fix.
It‚Äôs keeps freezing on me! Please fix, i have to reselect the person to continue typing a word...
The keyboard stops texting in the middle of a message, and becomes unresponsive to anything I try to do. I‚Äôve uninstalled, and restarted my phone. Nothing works. Better fix it soon.
I open messenger and it freezes! I get a few words typed but then that‚Äôs it.
I‚Äôm unable to write more than 3 words on the app before it won‚Äôt let me type anything else. Great app, just needs help.
Out of the blue, the app stopped recognizing input from the keyboard. I can only type a few words at a time (if that) and it won‚Äôt recognize the backspace button 90% of the time. (My keyboard works fine with other apps.) Definitely irritating. üòû
I use Messenger all the time. I think it's pretty good. However, there are occasional glitches. For example, as of 1-17-18, I am very frequently experiencing a glitch (only in Messenger) where after typing a word, sometimes the entire text box freezes up, so I have to leave the conversation and open it again just to continue the message.
Every time I try to type a message the app stops working halfway through. I‚Äôve deleted the app and reinstalled it and it still won‚Äôt work. If it doesn‚Äôt get fixed soon I‚Äôll be deleting the app for good.
Why is there always a problem. Right now I can‚Äôt type more than a word without messenger responding and not letting me type anymore. This is super frustrating.
I can‚Äôt get 1 sentence typed without sending 5 messages it just stops typing and the only thing it will let me do is send it. Then I type a few more words and it stops so I send that and so on it‚Äôs really annoying. I have reported the problem hopefully I can get it fixed. Never had any issue with messenger before now
This is for iPhone 7s. When I‚Äôm typing I will get a suggestion for a word. But when that word is inserted I am not able to type anymore. The curser is still at the end of the inserted word but no matter what I do I can‚Äôt continue typing afterward. I don‚Äôt know if this is because of an update or if it was bugged intentionally but it needs fixed. 
My Facebook Messenger app on my iPhone X won‚Äôt allow me to type messages. Please help ...
It‚Äôs only letting me type a couple words at a time then it stops.  Fix the bugs
I keep trying to message someone and it won‚Äôt let me type more than 2 or 3 words at a time!! I restarted my phone thinking that was it but it‚Äôs just this app acting upüòí
So in a sense, the app is pretty versatile. It‚Äôs great for what I need it for most of the time but I swear every time there‚Äôs an update, they fix problems most of us didn‚Äôt experience and cause new bugs to fix the next time they update it. This time, there was nothing wrong as far as I was concerned and I install the update as usual, now every time the keyboard autocorrects contractions (ya know like don‚Äôt, can‚Äôt, and won‚Äôt) the keyboard stops recognizing that your typing. So every time it does this I have to back out of the conversation so I can go back and continue typing.
Keyboard stops responding and app crashes all of a sudden. Worked fine yesterday, now not so much. What happened?
Today my messenger app started malfunctioning. When I am trying to type a message, it just stops letting me type and a random time. Then it won‚Äôt let me delete anything. I‚Äôve tried deleting and redownloading the app. I‚Äôve deleted both Facebook and messenger and reinstalled them. I restarted and hard restarted my phone and am having the same issues no matter what. I can‚Äôt find any solutions online either. It‚Äôs so frustrating.
App force closes once or twice a day, and the keyboard has been freezing when I‚Äôm in the middle of typing a message (this happening only on this app).
Messenger is now ceasing typing halfway through messages on iPhone X. Have to back out of the message and return to finish
I‚Äôve never had much of a problem with Facebook messenger. But now I communicate mostly with people through messenger as opposed to text. Since the last update, when I open any chat, I type one to two words before my keyboard completely freezes and won‚Äôt let me do anything further. I have to close the app and reopen it or use voice to text to send anything. Please look into this problem. Thanks.
Would only let me type a few words then would freeze just for that person, and works fine whenever else I use it
My keyboard keeps freezing when I am typing only on this app, needs to be updated.
Ever since last update I can only type one word and then can‚Äôt use space
I can‚Äôt write more than 3 words, fix the app
When I type on Facebook Messenger, I can‚Äôt finish what I‚Äôm saying because the keyboard stops working so I can only type a few words before that happens and I‚Äôm stuck not being able to press another word, backspace, or space. Anyone else have the same problem too?
Please fix this app it keeps freezing up!!
Won‚Äôt let me type a message.
Whenever my phone autocorrects something the app completely freezes and won‚Äôt let me continue to type or backspace or anything until I have gotten rid of the app from my recently used apps or whatever it‚Äôs called. It makes it so I have to send half a text or have take forever to send a simple message. Otherwise the app has been working fine, it just suddenly stopped working. Now in order to send messages I need to have the autocorrect off, which isn‚Äôt good for me because I am a horrible speller.
Since the last update, I am only able to type one word at a time. Then, I have to close the app to type the next word. It is horrible.   Also, please add a translator like Facebook. It‚Äôs hard to communicate with other countries when it doesn‚Äôt translate. Thank you! 
messenger is horrible on my iPhone 6+!! Whenever someone calls me and I unlock my phone, the screen takes forever to load the video and sometimes the other person can‚Äôt hear me. also, whenever i‚Äôm typing a message, it gets stuck on typing and i have to close the whole app before i can retype my message. PLEASE FIX!! 
As of today l, I am experiencing a really weird glitch where it freezes my keyboard while typing. (I can click other letters, but nothing types into the box. It freezes more so after I typo/adjustment or right after I use the number keyboard.)
I start typing a message and it acts like it‚Äôs frozen. Can‚Äôt backspace or keep typing even though the cursor is blinking. Rebooted phone and everything is up to date.
Suddenly unable to write to anyone! What happened!? Please fix!
Literally freezes my keyboard after each word. Can‚Äôt type more than one word at a time suddenly. ONLY app I‚Äôm having an issue with. Nope. Don‚Äôt need it.
Only lets me type one or two words per line, then I have to force close and restart app just to have it happen again.  I‚Äôm using an IPad Pro with all the updates.  Piece of garbage messenger.
Randomly stops recognizing text!!!!
App had been fine but now it stops typing whenever it wants and you can‚Äôt delete or continue typing anything until rebooting the app. Takes about 3 reboots per message trying to be sent. Looking for new message apps or just gonna stick with iphone messages
My messenger app won‚Äôt let me type. I deleted the app and reinstalled it but nothing works.
This newest update keeps freezing my phone üò° I don‚Äôt like this at all!!!!!! Stop changing it!!!
It seems to only allow me to type a few lines then won‚Äôt let me type further.
I use an iPhone and messenger won‚Äôt let me type after a word gets autocorrected I have to exit out of the app to continue to get my keyboard to work and it‚Äôs only messenger no other apps
i‚Äôm having an issue where anytime something autocorrects in messenger, it won‚Äôt let me type anything else and i have to close messenger and go back in and it‚Äôll just do it again. please fix this. it‚Äôs only on messenger and nothing else so it‚Äôs obviously a problem.
Keeps pausing every time I type a few words. Keeps making me exit out the conversation. Fix this. It‚Äôs annoying.
I‚Äôve always loved messenger, but literally I updated my messenger app today and now when I try to respond to someone it lets me type like 2 words and then shuts me completely down and I can‚Äôt type forward or backwards. Uninstalling
I use Facebook messenger often but for some reason it recently stopped registering what I‚Äôm typing, after a few words nothing else goes through even though I can see the keys being hit. I have to get out of the convo and go back in just to keep typing, but only for a few more words! Basically, doing this repeatedly has become very annoying and frustrating. Hoping for an update ASAP to fix this bug.
Literally out of nowhere the app got buggy...like how can I even use the app if I can‚Äôt type more than 3 words at a time?! I even deleted the app and downloaded it again and it still does the same thing. What gives?!
Can‚Äôt type more than two words on my iPhone. A bit buggy.
I used to constantly message friends through Facebook but now that I‚Äôm forced to use this crappy app, I NEVER do. Stop making things more complicated.
Every time I try to type as of lately, it will just not work, my keyboard says I‚Äôm typing but it will not show up. It‚Äôs really weird
Currently, messenger is having this problem now where I can only type two or three words at a time until it won‚Äôt let me type anything anymore. It won‚Äôt let me type again unless I back out of the conversation and open it back up. Please fix this.
You need to update it and fix bugs everytime I‚Äôm trying to text a sentence I can only send one to four words it‚Äôs very upsetting plz fix
Can only write a few words before it won‚Äôt let me finish have to push enter then a few more words. It started after the apple update today
I will be typing a message and half way thru the message it will stop typing and the app will freeze ):
Every time I try to type a regular message, the text box stop showing the letters I'm typing and then I have to left the message window, get back to the main interface and then go back to the conversation with the person who I'm talking to, yo be able to type a FEW words just to have to do the processe all over again and again and again till I complete writing the message! HORRIBLE BUG!
It is messing up
Ok, probably because it needs another update, but it won‚Äôt allow me to write full sentences! And it isn‚Äôt my keyboard, that still works, and acts like it is still texting. Instead I have to send one or two words at a time which is horrifically ANNOYING.
Keyboard on my iPhone X has started to not work after 5 seconds of typing, but only with this app. This just started today but is very frustrating as I use this app for a lot of my messaging.
Typing freezes after about 20 characters, sometimes less. This just started about 20 mins ago. I have to leave a chat, go to messenger home page, and reopen chat to continue typing... another ~20 characters before it freezes again. Kind of annoying!  UPDATE: Just realized that it freezes every time autocorrect fixes something. Need to fix this fast! 
Updated my iPhone 6 to latest version and of iOS and started having problems with messenger.  Please fix
Suddenly the app won‚Äôt let me type more than two words before my keyboard stops working... pretty disappointing.
Developers please review and see if you can fix the issue I‚Äôm having while trying to type it will freeze.
I wanna see my messages on the app.
Every time I get a message weather on my phone or my iPod it tells me what the message says.  For example my iPod and phone are locked and then I get a message and it's still on the lock screen and it tells me what they said instead of it saying I just have a message from that person it shows what they said in the message. I just want it to say I have a message.  If you guys could fix that n make so that I only says I have a message from the person I would oh so greatly appreciate it. 
Something terribly wrong. It‚Äôs not my mobile; it‚Äôs Messenger. Please fix this!
Since the last update I can only type for a few seconds then it stops typing all together! I have to completely close the app and reopen to try and finish my message, this is unacceptable.
Won‚Äôt let me finish more then a single word before keyboard basically stops working and won‚Äôt let me type anything
Messenger freezes or crashes!
Recent update, can‚Äôt type anything. I get a couple words in then it freezes up. Can‚Äôt go back, can‚Äôt delete, can‚Äôt continue typing, can‚Äôt do anything except hit send. I literally have to spam my friends to talk to them.
You‚Äôd think this company would have basic bugs fixed. Although for some odd reason I can‚Äôt type more then two words without the app stopping me from typing anything else unless I type word by word. Smh
Needs to be updated. Won‚Äôt let me type
I have the iPhone 6Plus.  I have uninstalled this app many times. At first, it kept making phone calls by itself. It would just call random people and then it finally stopped. Now today, it lets me type out a few words and then it stops. I can‚Äôt backspace or nothing. I have to completely close the app and restart it to type a few words and then it stops. Then I do it until I am finished with the message. It‚Äôs getting very frustrating. I am typing just fine on everything else. But messenger for some odd reason, is acting crazy and I‚Äôm about tired of it!! Fix it!! 
I am trying to talk to my friends and when I start typing the facebook massager my keyboard freezes and it won‚Äôt let my type
Yooooo Facebook messenger y‚Äôall got a bug happening with the texting. It‚Äôll let you start texting and then all the sudden it won‚Äôt let you type or delete anything anymore even after force closing several times. Might want to look into it I‚Äôm about to delete it it‚Äôs so frustrating. Just with this app not with any other source on my phone, it‚Äôs all good on everything else including texting out this review. Good thing I didn‚Äôt have to do this through the app ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
How about when you stop cutting off my texts at a certain point before I can finish I‚Äôll rate you more than 2 stars  Maybe then I can actually get my point across in one message rather than 1000 or constantly having to close and reopen the conversation???? 
I use this app to connect with a number of people on a daily basis. But for some reason starting today it‚Äôs not allowing me to finish typing out messages. It just stops typing what I‚Äôm putting in. Please fix this.
Try to delete messages but old messages from 2 months ago keep popping up. Keep having to delete the app and reinstall. PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM. so annoying!!!!!!!!  Update: now the app will not let me type one word without freezing up. This is ridiculous. 
This app is worthless. I can‚Äôt type at all. What‚Äôs the point in a messenger app if I can‚Äôt type!
I hate messenger so much. It is so utterly ridiculous to require a separate app to be able to send messages. I actually hate Facebook too but this silliness has caused me to disable my Facebook and move on completely to twitter, which I think is a much better and more interesting platform. This is an inconvenience. I just want to send in app messages. This annoys me.
If every other messaging service this day and age can figure out how to instantly deliver messages, why can‚Äôt this one? Things will stay stuck as ‚Äúsent‚Äù for hours. Whether they‚Äôre read or not, it should not be this hard to just deliver them. You had one job, messenger. Can‚Äôt even do that right.
I deleted this app because I was real tired of the mass chain letters and men trying to friend me. This app needs a way to limit views and the ability to delete people you had a connection with a while ago and no longer do.
Since the update it won‚Äôt keep a steady connection. Keeps going back and forth from connecting to not connected üëéüèª
Since realizing this app doesn‚Äôt permit that, I‚Äôve to look for other ways for sharing my works to my costumers. Please fix. Thanks
Can you guys make it to where when your not friends with someone you can see when they are active or not.!?
You can‚Äôt print from it ,data is hard to work with. I have to download it each time my friends use it. I keep telling my friends not to use it.
135MB for a crapshoot messaging app? This app is bloated? LOL!  Devs need to go on a diet. Deleted! Use safari!
ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ ÿπŸÑŸäŸÉŸÖ ÿ¨ÿßŸä ÿ™ÿÆÿ™ŸÅŸä ÿπŸÜÿØŸä ŸÜÿµ ÿßŸÑŸÉŸÑÿßŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸä ÿ®ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≠ÿßÿØÿ´Ÿá ÿ¥ŸÜŸà ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿ®ÿ®
Not bad, easy to hate on Facebook but it‚Äôs a good service and the app works well.  That said, they must have updated it recently to be VERY persistent about turning on notifications. This is hugely annoying as I would have figured the business professionals at Facebook would consider the many reasons why notifications would be preferred off by many. In a work environment or simply to avoid the addiction/phone anxiety that notifications can cause, I would prefer no notifications. Very annoying to get prompts multiple times a day to turn on. Bad product management with no consideration for user acceptance.   1 star till this changes. 
It‚Äôs annoying to keep switching between facebook app and messenger app to brows and chat, i wish they gave us the option to chat within the facebook app like the good old days, this messenger app is basically the old chat in facebook whith fancy colors and slower performance, don‚Äôt get me wrong it has some good features like video chat and other stuff.. but if you just want to text its not the best way.
No me gusto la actualizaci√≥n
Who ever decided to do another IPhone update. Why did the messenger games disappear. I was playing people now I can‚Äôt. Stupid people.
It‚Äôs a free app. why the hell do i need to give you my debit card info...
I‚Äôve been using the app for about a good 4-5 Years now. I must say the app itself has changed a lot with new features and new add-ons. However, what would make this app even better is if you guys integrated Dark mode into the app for night use. Especially people with visual impairment like Myself, I‚Äôve been having eye-strains from the white light. I‚Äôve been using the iOS warm light feature to compensate, but I think this would be a feature everybody would and will love mainly for healthier use for your eyes and because dark mode is becoming quiet popular among the tech community.   Overall good app üëçüèº. 
I think for me this is the best app
nln
Turn your microphone off and don‚Äôt allow anything for this app. Their is a reason why they make us download an app separately from Facebook. Read the agreement form and see what you‚Äôre agreeing to. Some of the things you‚Äôre agreeing to is them listening 24/7 to your convos, text messages, picture, messenger messages...etc for advertisement and what ever else they do with our info. Be smart. Read up.
Crap
This is revolutionary new technology!!! I love it!!! 0112358134
Well, the quality of the call in messenger is so poor. I‚Äôm moving to What‚Äôs Up. It‚Äôs much better that faster. Sound is best too. You have to fix it developer. Fix it.
Esta actualizaci√≥n no sirve porque da acceso a agregar personas que quiz√° uno no conoce o que le escriban al privado sabe Dios que lo mismo puede ir desde amenazas hasta fotos y textos fuera de lugar preferir√≠a que solo pudieran escribir mis amigos los cuales est√°n en mi Facebook Muchas Gracias
Randomly my messages won‚Äôt send to somebody but they will to other people. And when I use any other app, the messages go through perfectly fine so it‚Äôs not my service or theirs.
Facebook is invading your privacy BIG TIME by spying on you through your phone camera! We‚Äôve known for a while that we are being monitored through our search engines. But this is TOO FAR! Voyeurism much facebook??!!
I have been locked out every time I update! Even fab too! Can only get this fab if someone sends a fab message or photo! Ridiculous to know ur password and have it written down but never get in! Too hard too many questions that have been the same answers but being declined! Fix this please sick of trying on every password/ I tunes /etc I updated it again and again now nothing works not my phone it‚Äôs you faulty apps! Maria r kelly@ me . Com
The app isn‚Äôt customizable. I should be able to turn off unwanted adds. There‚Äôs always a red badge notification that will not go away.
Even though I have reported spam on conversations, I still see the fake messenger on the list when typed the name.  What can I do to omit this fake messenger?  It‚Äôs not the conversation...it‚Äôs the usage of the person‚Äôs name.  That‚Äôs the issue.   Please help.
It is amazing you should try it
I would like to read the messages that were sent to me in Facebook but when I try to get Messenger it just says "loading" but never actually loads.
ü§©ü§©
Had a person who stole a friend‚Äôs Facebook ID troll me and no Messenger help was useful, in part because they described options that could not be found on iPhone or iPad. Deleted the app but have to reload it because a family member temporarily can only use it to communicate.
I‚Äôm use iPhone 6s... But only this phone not chathead. Yours should be must a new update. I hope chathead problem solve 
This is a spy tool to invade your privacy without you knowing it once you give them permission to access your camera microphone they can watch you and here you without you even knowing.
It‚Äôs a every fun game but many people think it should be it‚Äôs own app
Horrible app
Why iOS application does not contain ‚Äú My Day‚Äù on top of chat messages but Android application has this feature?
I send myself things to read at a later time from Facebook to the msgr. in this latest version, if I send myself something that is just a link, it gives me the tap to retry button. Or if I look at a video and try to read the comments, it does the same thing.
La peor aplicaci√≥n!! Cierras cuenta en facebook pero el messenger se queda abierto.
It seems I cannot use this app on my iPad without being on Facebook, however I can use it on my iPhone without being on Facebook. Is there away to accomplish using my iPad without being on Facebook? 
I only have messenger for those who are on my Facebook friends list.  I don‚Äôt want people who are not my ‚Äúfriends list‚Äù contacting me on messenger.  There should be a setting for that as an option.  Not a friend, don‚Äôt contact me unless you have my personal information given to you by the account holder.  It‚Äôs like borderline stalking.  Change immediately!!!!
Dangerous app !!!  Unless you want them to access all your personal information and everything on your phone ‚ÄîJUST SAYING. ENTER AT YOU'RE OWN RISK !!!!! I‚Äôm giving this a one star rating because it wouldn‚Äôt let me post it without having something starred. Reality is- DO NOT GET IT. I DID NOT BELIEVE IT AT  FIRST, EITHER.
I love the app just wish it could group unread messages in one place so that we don‚Äôt have to scroll and scroll to find it ! Hope this one review out of a thousand gets read .....

It‚Äôs an alright app... it has basic texting functions, it links well with facebook, but it is so easy to get hacked. I open a link from a friend and BAM it sends the same thing to all of my friends on facebook. Fix this
Facebook should delete messenger and either partner with WhatsApp, or copy it.  That‚Äôs how a messaging app should work
When i chating with someone the sound of chat won‚Äôt work
I used to LOOOOVE this app. So much so, that my life almost depended on it. Lol! It‚Äôs one of those ‚ÄòWhere have you been all my life?‚Äô digital necessities.  UNTIL.  One time I just had to uninstall it for a reason, fully intending to re-install it in a few minutes, which I did, and voila...ALL my downloaded stickers have gone away, except for ‚ÄòMeep‚Äô, which is a default download, I suppose. SO infuriating! I have at least 40 sticker packs downloaded on there! AT LEAST. Roughly more. What, am I supposed to RE-DOWNLOAD every single one of them again?? How the hell am I supposed to get ALL 40 stickers back and remember every last one of them!? I REFUSE...to waste time re-downloading all those stickers one by one, when I‚Äôve already done that in the past. And by the way, I‚Äôve also already tried the old tack of uninstalling, then re-installing the app, in fact, MULTIPLE times. Also shutting down / powering off my device. I use an iPad. But still. Nothing.  Plus, it‚Äôs also been freezing a lot lately, that I can‚Äôt do virtually ANYTHING on it; and sometimes, my messages don‚Äôt get sent to a friend until HOURS later. And how come you couldn‚Äôt sign out of it? There‚Äôs only the option to switch accounts. What if you don‚Äôt want to switch, you just want to sign out? But the sticker thing was what ticks me off the most.  This is just plain ridiculous. Thanks a lot, developers. And to think of all those times I‚Äôve succumbed to your MANY...MANY updates. SUPPOSEDLY to improve the app. And yet...this is still what I get. I hope you provide a fix for this, people.  It used to be my most convenient app, the most reliable app in my device; I used to think the world of Messenger... Well, not anymore. Or at least, not recently. Until this issue is resolved, that is.  ETA : Not to sound pompous, but I‚Äôm pretty good at troubleshooting, and I sorta pride myself for it, but this one had me stumped. If I ever find a way to fix this, OR if Messenger somehow fixes this problem by itself, by some type of miracle or whatever...I promise to come back here and write another review- a positive one this time, which, let‚Äôs just say, will be nothing short of a compliment-fest. 
Not cool Facebook. Please kindly keep the ads away.
I have no my day-.-
Facebook added Ads, many useless features, a lot of fancy things that helps nobody.  It‚Äôs ok, if it wasn‚Äôt executed in cost of stability and effective and productive chats.  App crashes constantly, links frozing whole app, due to ads on my SE it covers 3/4 of chats available.  It was hard, but I recommend everyone to replace all chats in other app. It‚Äôs going to be worse :( 
Do mention the changes you make each update. The ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs new‚Äô is unprofessional and makes me dread updates, making me hope an interface I lived doesn‚Äôt get changed.   Yes, the interface has changed for the worse. It‚Äôs more Snapchat-esque, and that‚Äôs not what people use Messenger for.  Maybe leave the stories to the Active Now page and rename it to Activity? 
Where the heck are the rest of my photos that I‚Äôve sent to my friends?????
try re-activating the deleted account
Facebooks messenger app is a pointless application‚Äîeveryone already has free text messaging and pays for cell phone service, so why create a new application (for things like virtual yard sale) and ask for permissions to text and call?  I find it absolutely absurd that I have to download an app to view messages from a web based platform.  (No I DO NOT have the FB app, thank you.). Not only that but the two rarely communicate efficiently.  After you check messages in the app, FB profile will still show a messages notification.  On top of that every time you use it asks for notifications to be turned on (why? When FB should be notifying you?) and asking for permission for microphone and camera.  The app drains battery power when you do have notifications turned on especially in group chats‚Äîpinging every time there is a new comment. I‚Äôm not sure what a good use for this app is‚Äîit should be reintegrated back into Facebook and allow users to check messages from the web based platform.
I hate all the things you have added to the app. It‚Äôs too busy and don‚Äôt use most of its features. I miss the basic it. Where you can see who is active, who has the messenger app, and your messages to and from people. Sometimes the basic one opens up for me still which is weird. I only use this app to chat message my friends. Please stop adding features and go back to the basic. It‚Äôs not always better to add more. Sometimes less is better.
It was a great app but it started freezing and crashing. It doesn‚Äôt seem to be my phone‚Äôs problem because it‚Äôs the only app that does it. It‚Äôs so frustrating when you have typed a long message and when you‚Äôre about to send it, you have to close the app or restart your phone.  I already uninstalled and reinstalled it. I even turn off my phone wishing that it would perform well after the restart. Please give your app an update, Facebook. 
People have contacted me and I haven‚Äôt seen for over 50 years. It‚Äôs a lot of fun but it takes a lot of time.
Tried loading on iPhone and iPad and neither are loading this app when I need it to load it. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and still not working extremely frustrating. Today was the first day it has happened fix this soon extremely need this to work thanks.
Someone hacked into messenger. I went to fb and changed my password. I erased the messenger app off my phone because there is no way to log off of messenger. I reloaded the app from the App Store. I was not asked to use any password to start using messenger. There. Now all the contacts are there. Not happy about this at all!! I‚Äôm not using messenger until this is fixed!!!!!!!
I use to be able to make FaceTime calls with Messenger to my brother but now, every time he answers it immediately hangs the call up and vice Versa when he calls us. We have different OS and not sure if it‚Äôs Apple or Android issue but annoying when the kids wish to speak to their Uncle FaceTime wise.
After the recent update, the app is extremely sluggish and laggy on my iPhone SE
That‚Äôs true my friend is having the same problem they ask him to submit a selfie, then wait, when he calls the Facebook hotline you always seem like your talking to someone overseas, first time they told him to send 199.98 said someone was using his account to try and get money from people next time he call, they told him to send 99dollar in a money order what a joke why would Facebook need a money order to turn his account on.
Tried to download and didn‚Äôt let me
Like i like it because you can comunicate but i wish you did not need internet to send messages
My voice messenger isn‚Äôt really working every time I press and hold and release it doesn‚Äôt send I‚Äôm not sure if this happens with anyone else but yeah it‚Äôs starting to get aggravating
Guys I need help. Months ago I accidentally clicked myday's hide button so it doesn't works now. I want to unhide it so what can i do?
I hate hate hate hate hate this app. I get so mad when people message me with it. I have to download the +#+#¬£<¬£# app, read what they want, DELETE APP, text message them reminding them that I hate and do not use this app! I liked the old way. You could email people IN FB without having to use a separate app
Can you move the button for messenger away from the back button so I can stop accidentally hitting it?  I still hate that it's two awful apps now instead of one.  I switched to Paper after they broke the FB apps apart then they discontinued that app.  I've found myself using FB way less since Paper is gone.  I don't care for having two apps for something that used to be one and I don't care for any of the extra features.  Did you stop Paper because it was too good?
At random moments the app will just exit out and end any calls I‚Äôm on within the app. This didn‚Äôt start happening until recently today.
It‚Äôs great for all ages cause you can if you are a kid and on vacation and you want to talk to relatives and you parents won‚Äôt let you talk to em just use this
Like WhatsApp I‚Äôll love to erase all the chat I have open and not erase them one by one!
Can not get it now that I had to reinstall
Lately, there has been a great deal of news reports that Messenger is not safe to use and most if not all of a users personal information can be compromised. Therefore, I have deleted and ceased using Messenger until this information has been proven to be untrue. I did like the future and being able to communicate with friends across the country.
I dont know why I gave to continuously reload! Please fix the bugs
Facebook should never have separated this from the FB app. I bought a new device and didn‚Äôt even install it.  I‚Äôm sending out a message to my FB friends that I‚Äôm deleting it from other devices and providing a WhatsAPP account to reach me.
I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, but with the recent update I can‚Äôt attach audio clips from Voice Memos now. Along with that, I can‚Äôt see websites within the app as well. There‚Äôs an error screen as if there isn‚Äôt data loading and to link to WiFi or data, which I have both on.  Fix the issue, you had it right.  You pretty much force us to download FB messenger, so have it work right or don‚Äôt force us to download a faulty app. 
When we delete a conversation the recipient should not be able to still see the conversation.
It lags like crazy and not only does the app completely freeze when you‚Äôre trying to message someone back, it freezes your ENTIRE PHONE. This is complete nonsense.
I love messenger don‚Äôt get me wrong but when I video call my boyfriend it‚Äôs blurry and very pixelated. Please fix it
Please fix your Apple Watch app... it doesn‚Äôt load!
Hey Messenger team,  I‚Äôm a big fan of the app. It‚Äôs my go to on video messaging app because everyone has messenger.   One problem, after updating my iPhone 6 Plus to the latest iOS 11.2.2 all reactions (smiles and the thumbs up & down) to messages disappeared. I still get notifications when my phone is locked but don‚Äôt see them in the chat. My guess is this is a temporary glitch.   Thanks for all your hard work 
I haven‚Äôt been able to put the people im on the phone with on speaker no matter how many times i push the button or call them back. please fix soon
I‚Äôm not big on social media but making you install a second app was the a poor decision of Facebook. I‚Äôm still on Facebook but refuse to use this app.  I have to log onto my windows computer to delete the unwanted messages and make the changes I desire. Horrible app. 
I want this app off my phone!!!!!!!!
It just logged me in to an account I had disabled for over a year I really am hating this app
I was unfortunate enough to have two friends start Words With Friends games with me through Messenger. Now I can‚Äôt get the stupid app to stop pinging my cell phone to tell my ‚ÄúSo-and-so has not played for X hours‚Äù, or ‚ÄúSo-and-so is waiting for you to start a game.‚Äù  I DO NOT WANT FB PINGING MY PHONE!!!  RUDE! RUDE! RUDE! I can‚Äôt even find a way to delete WWF from FB on my phone, like I did on my computer. What do I have to do, delete Messenger to get you to leave me alone?
It is any way to fix that problem.
1. Remove the annoying invite *name* to messenger for people who use the online version.  2. Bring back the old messenger your snapchat style update isn‚Äôt working for facebook or messenger.  3. Bring back the old typing rectangle style from 2 years ago back.  4. Delete the main chat emoji.   5. Bring back the old facebook stickers they looked better, these new age messenger emojis aren‚Äôt working.  6. Bring back the old slide to choose commands for each chats, instead of the new press and hold to choose commands.  7. You guys should ask your users what they like.  8. Put back the messenger and facebook into one app again. No one wants 2 apps. 
I hate this app. Make everything much more difficult. Do I have the option to don‚Äôt install it and still use Facebook messages?
It's annoying as hell... üôÑ and pointless to have separated the two.
This thing crashes a lot
Too install two apps to complete each other.
Facebook seriously needs to rectify this app. It is slow as balls, will barely load most of the time, drags and lags like a sob. Facebook, get your act together - you‚Äôre better than this.
Why did you remove our ringtone now it‚Äôs just a simple one I wanted my ringtone (opening) to play but now it‚Äôs just yours! Please change it back Please/Thank You
When someone changes their profile picture, it's probably gonna take a long time to see it on Messenger.
This was so useful before like it was great l would always use it to make calls and now it‚Äôs glitchy like ugh like wow like üôÑüôÑ come on I can‚Äôt even answer my hoes now
I'm REALLY annoyed by the options that pop up after someone responds to me.  I don't want an automatic option to pop up to FIND MUSIC or FIND GIF!!!!  This is SO ANNOYING and I can't seem to find a way to disable it!!!!!
All mine has been doing for days is loading. I have deleted rebooted everything and nothing is working
Who‚Äôs active issues
The video chat on the other end camera is mirrored instead of regular
Since the last updates you guys got a lot of new bugs. The most recent one - I have an exam in two days and wanted to download pictures of the pages from the book that I will need but every time I press ‚ÄúSave All‚Äù (there are multiple pictures) the all just shuts down. Also, messages that I send (to only some of my friends for some reason) take a very long time to actually get delivered. And This is happening while my internet connection is flawless. I‚Äôm forced to use this app to talk with my Facebook friends. If this continues I‚Äôll be forced to switch to a different social media platform. Absolutely terrible!
Alot of times, my ‚Äúmy day‚Äù doesnt show who is read it, and too many time my friends ‚Äúmy day‚Äù doesnt show up their new post. I have to log out and log in again, and im very tired about this. Please fix it
It doesn‚Äôt really work with the newest iOS it so slow and takes 30 seconds just to open app and see who messages are from. Then another 30 - 40 seconds to open a message. Has taken up to 2 minutes to send a regular photo. Since Facebook never actually communicates with customers to let them know they‚Äôre aware and addressing the issue. I used to feel off about complaining since it‚Äôs free but since it‚Äôs Technically not that they make way more on adds & selling your personal information than if they had a membership fee. So please FB fix it
Stop asking me to turn on notifications. I don't want them turned on. End of story.
trash app
Fix this messenger bc joining this cam is gone it keeps disappearing all the time fix this please
Normal messaging app. They need to turn off the bubbles when your typing a message. No one need to know if your responding till they get the message. Sometimes you need to re write a reply a few times. Also, forcing me to turn on notifications is annoying.
It keeps on crashing
I don‚Äôt want to be logged on 24 hours a day... Add a log off feature
Hi this app is great It‚Äôs how I text people!ü¶Ñ
No matter how many times I keep deleting Shared photos or close the app the pics won't Completely deleted they keep coming back this needs to be Fix Now !!! And Updated to be fixed a update to there you can deleted Chat conversations and all the pics and videos all get Deleted and when I do close the app they won't show up anymore this needs to be looked into because I love messager and they need to do their jobs in fixing issues like Shared photos issue >:(
I was in a group chat and turned off notifications and everything couldn‚Äôt delete gave my phone a virus messed up screen everything. I eventually got it off by resetting my phone. Do not recommend.
Please please please have a way to OPT OUT of being sent those chain messages. They are full of viruses. PLEASE MAKE A WAY for people to block those, please
Ever message I send it says they have read it automatically it‚Äôs just annoying
HATE that every time you add a new friend it sends you a message asking you to message them. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.  I understand that I can message people through messenger. Isn‚Äôt that the point??   Also way too hard to get mass messages deleted. Where‚Äôs the select all button??  And can I just add, so lame Facebook requires you to have this app to message people through fb.   No wonder young people don‚Äôt use this anymore. 
Ok .. the app is phenomenal .. except for the fact that I cannot load it at the moment. WHAT DID YOU DO? It worked fine before.
I do not have Facebook downloaded on my phone but pull it up to view and hate that also have to download Messenger because it forces you to if someone wants to send you a message on Facebook. So because I have 14 messages I am going through the hassle to download and will then remove because I DONT WANT IT ON MY PHONE! Stop forcing us to get our messages here let them post on Facebook!!! Lousy customer service!!!
Please, add more notification sounds. This one is really annoying.
Let me erase the foolish people that try to get on my messenger.  Or allow me a cookie erase.
Bosta trava tudo demora pra carregas as coisas
It almost never just opens,it seems to need an update very often
PLEASE change BACK to connect though Facebook. Why even have a Messenger button on a FB page if all it does is send you on a wild goose chase to another page, which when you click the ‚Äúok‚Äù button, it takes you to another page which does not directly connect you to the person like it used to. Quite annoying and VERY RARELY use Messenger on it‚Äôs own. MOST of the time I am sending a message to a contact after reading something on their Facebook feed. Don‚Äôt fix what wasn‚Äôt broken, because now it is. Thanks
It‚Äôs boring and absurd to check on my message that I have to upload this app instead of viewing my messages on regular Facebook app.
Can‚Äôt find my messages half the time. Not straight forward. A messy ,messy app.
The app doesn‚Äôt work anymore I tried restarting and reinstalling it let‚Äôs me login but then I can‚Äôt do anything on it it just shows spinning things that shows that it‚Äôs loading.Also I tried the app support but it sed I had to open the app and then click support in the settings...doesn‚Äôt really work when you can‚Äôt access the app...
I don‚Äôt like that fb decided a separate app is needed to begin with, but since I have to use it anyway please consider removing ‚ÄúYou are now connected to messenger‚Äù notification for when someone is added as a friend on fb. It‚Äôs stupid and annoying. At least makes it an option to turn it off for notification setting.
I have zero sound? All my settings are correct. 
One suggestion is to give an option to hide the stupid ‚ÄúMy Day‚Äù thing. I don‚Äôt want to see that, I don‚Äôt use it‚Äîit‚Äôs just annoying and takes up space. Another suggestion is to add more chat colors, the current ones are mostly ugly, so please let us pick custom colors. But overall, I love the app. I do all my texting through this app. It‚Äôs almost like having iMessage with Android users. I rarely use the actual iOS Messages app anymore because FB Messenger allows me to send real-time messages to Android users.
Dear sir/madam  I have iPhone X  When i want to type the keyboard cover the the space where i cant see what i am writing so i have to pull the page up and this happens every time i need to right or i have to turn the predictions off !! 
good app but can you please add an Pizza emoji ?
WE WANT THE OPTION TO DELETE ALL MESSAGES AT ONCE!  This soaks up all our spare data for no reason
Sad to say I‚Äôve been very FB-positive and using and promoting the use of the services for personal and professional communication, event organization, creative discussions/etc. I am fine with ads in the general feed, however, TOTALLY unacceptable to place ads in the private messenger space. I haven‚Äôt yet jumped to WhatApp/Telegram/other, but will as my preferred and primary tool if the invasive ads in FB Messenger continue.
Bug issues frequently. Spies on you and analyzes your messages for zuckerberg. Has no value over alternagives other than the fact that everyone uses it, which isnt value from the app. 
FB makes you give up too much privacy to use this app.
I only got this app because some jerk removed the safari log-in accessibility to force us to download it. It takes up way too much space, 1g is insane for the lame capabilities of this application.
Include received videos in you media gallery. All my pictures are there but im tired of having to scroll through hundreds of messages to find a video.
App constantly crashes now, especially while I‚Äôm in a call. Connection is terrible and it barely connects half of the time.
Es muy buena la opcion. Pero no es Bueno que no se cierre cuando cierras el Facebook.
This is very good I. I love using it as it helps me a lot.
It no longer shows who is online
Nice app
I will like to know, where can I find the configuration? I don‚Äôt want to appear online, sometimes all I want is to read my messages and no to chat with anyone. Thank you.
It‚Äôs like Facebook is forcING you to download the messenger so you can read your own messages people don‚Äôt like it it‚Äôs Anooying to have go back to the older version we‚Äôre you can read your messages without havering to download THIS STUIPD FACEBOOK APP
Lately I‚Äôve been sending older, saved voice memos from the default voice memo app on my iPhone. Ever since this morning, they won‚Äôt send! It says ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt send message; please check your connection and try again.‚Äù  I uninstalled and reinstalled, checked the privacy and made sure the app had access to my microphone, everything. Nothing works. They won‚Äôt send anymore, not after I updated it this morning. Not to mention, the app crashes occasionally and the photos/‚Äúonline/active‚Äù features are complete crap. It‚Äôll show old photos from MONTHS ago as profile pictures, and will claim a friend was online an hour ago when I‚Äôm literally messaging them as I look at it. Feels like every update just screws it up further. 
I deactivated my FB account for personal reasons but still use the Messenger app. There used to be a sign out toggle if you wanted to disconnect.  Several updates ago that toggle is no longer available.  I don‚Äôt want to be always connected and on line.  How do you disconnect from this app??  If there is no way to do this, you need an update to fix this!!!
The Good:  ‚Ä¢ Just about everyone I know has FB and therefore some form of Messenger. Super handy!  ‚Ä¢ We are a military family who has lived abroad for several years. I love that I can call friends and family through the app  ‚Ä¢ I love that I can share and receive pictures, videos, and even some documents so easily through the app  The Bad (and kind of infuriating):  ‚Ä¢ For all the talk of how we have choice with privacy, I do NOT understand why I can‚Äôt turn off the little green dot when I‚Äôm active (even if I toggle off the ‚Äúchat‚Äù - my son and I tested it)!  ‚Ä¢ To go along with my complaint above, WHY is it anyone‚Äôs business how long ago I was active? This should be a choice. Apps like WhatsApp give users this freedom to choose.  The Annoying:  ‚Ä¢ Dear Facebook Messenger, you are NOT Snapchat. Please stop trying to be Snapchat. If I wanted to have filters and things in my way every time I want to take a picture. Then I‚Äôd use Snapchat. You‚Äôre trying to be like them isn‚Äôt competition - it‚Äôs annoying. The people who want Messenger stay with Messenger. Please stop.  ‚Ä¢ I am confused about why the feature to pay/send/receive money is available in some accounts and devices and not all. You might be a pretty good competitor to PayPal of the feature were available to all.  So...there you have it: The Good, The Bad, and the Annoying 
Don‚Äôt do the most recent update the app crashes every time you use it. Usually it‚Äôs great but now it‚Äôs just a wasted app, hopefully this will be fixed soon.
I like the update in how it made it simpler, but will miss the text-react function and the games. Games aren‚Äôt necessary but it was a cool feature.  Please don‚Äôt try to be like Snapchat again 
FACEBOOK. PLEASE JUST INTEGRATE IT IN TO YOUR NORMAL APP. THIS JUST TAKES SPACE ON PHONES AND IS REALLY REALLY ANNOYING THANKS.
This is the worst messenging app. Scams allegedly coming from your friends. I have zero trust.
Messenger is extremely slow. And the delete messages is a hassle!
Need to be able block or something. I‚Äôm sick of all the junk people send. I don‚Äôt want all my friends being to send me all kinds of crazy mess.
It‚Äôs working good, but I can‚Äôt upload my histories on messenger üòûüòû
Awful, sound is bad when trying to video chat, unable to be unavailable while on messenger, just very unhappy with the app. Why must I have this installed anyway. I use to be able to message right from Facebook. Disappointed!!!
It's great!
My account was hacked and my phone got hacked also through a message in messenger!!! Trying to delete my messenger account and keep my Facebook but you apparently aren‚Äôt allowed to! Bull bull and more bull!!! I shouldn‚Äôt be forced to keep the stupid account!!! I get hacked and I have to keep it or delete my Facebook and my messenger and lose all my pics?? Stupid!!!!
Can‚Äôt turn off background activity. It‚Äôs eating +40% of my battery life. Going to have to delete it if it doesn‚Äôt get fixed. I‚Äôve turned all notifications, mic, everything off.
Huge invasion of privacy.
After updating, the app is very slow and clunky and next to unusable. Quickly resolve this issue or I'll leave.
The new update is causing Messenger to freeze at times and take over a minute to load. Please fix!
Constantly nags for notifications; can not disable read-receipts; a whole bog of obnoxious and superfluous ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù  I hate you Facebook for making me use this absurd monstrosity if I want to access fb messages. 
I first want to express my appreciation for this service at it enables me to readily communicate with far off places that I work with in helping marginalized societies, and group work with people all over the world.  There are some concerns I have with security. I administer several FB groups and I have found that on occasion individual profiles get hacked and taken over or duplicated. Then those criminals doing the hacking send messages to others scamming for money, prostitution, even trying to convince others to help terrorist move between countries.   I have a serious concern about this and think it prudent to develop a tighter security both on Facebook and Messenger. 
Everything was cool till this morning now it won‚Äôt load my chats and I can‚Äôt log back in to it it just keeps taking me back to my home screen
Sometimes it‚Äôs to low
I enjoy the app and the fun things I can do on it to share with my friends on insta and fb. I like the camera features that have been added... those are fun.   Overall, since I'm not too tech, I can't complain! :) 
That this app isn‚Äôt an option if you want to see messages using your phone should say enough.
Messages should be enabled to be deleted. It is bad for the businesses to not have this option.
Very good
It literally updated yesterday and it‚Äôs glitching and making it look like my message isn‚Äôt sending. Seriously, don‚Äôt update and do ‚Äúbug fixes‚Äù if it doesn‚Äôt do anything at all!!!
The app was working great before - worthy of a 5-Star review - but after the recent update has been glitchy and unusable. Can‚Äôt make video or audio calls anymore and messages sometimes disappear and other times seem to take forever to reach the person. Fix it, or roll the update back.
So like I got the new update and it switched back to the old one? ü§î
it's faster and i love filter it so funny i like it!
It does what it says it does. A must have if you communicate often through FB  I had given you 5 stars. But then I find out that you track my every move. That people can break into my messenger and use my camera. That you can not only track me but look at my contacts.   Is this true?! 
I would like to have a delete immediately message button especially when you know it‚Äôs a scam
Messenger is freezing and posting blanks to stories instead of your actual posts!
When you change your profile picture on the Facebook app messenger doesn‚Äôt change your picture. It takes dayssss or even a week or so to change on the messenger app. Also when you post stories and try to go back and look at what you post it shows a blue screen as if it‚Äôs not loaded. These issues needs to be fixed ASAP until then I rate this app 1 star. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
It's great
I have a brand new iPhone 8 so before you say it‚Äôs my phone let me rant: I hate that if I‚Äôm on Facebook it takes me to a separate app to view a message I hate that if I do choose to view a message I usually have to do an update first because of how crappy and how many times needs to be fixed. I also hate the fact that you took it away from the regular Safari view messages Hate that you try to attach my phone number I hate that anyone can follow me on there and send me messages There are so many bugs so many problems I get so irritated when someone tends to send me a message and I know they‚Äôre not close to me because they could just send me a text like everybody else Made no improvements change Facebook and it‚Äôs messages back to Safari where was easy convenient and no glitches 
Updated yesterday and now I can‚Äôt update my story. When I do it‚Äôs just blank blue.
No, as a matter of fact. I would not.
Need to fix the voice messages is annoying when you try to say some and is only one minute so stop putting stupidity in the app trying to please immature people by the end of the day is for messages..
Even after updating and restarting my iphone messenger won't open. So annoying!
It's amazing!
I usually like the app, however this newest update...no, just no! I really don‚Äôt like that it doesn‚Äôt show whether a user is active or not. I don‚Äôt care if they use messenger or Facebook; I want to see if the person is active. Some people I talk to I prefer to see if they‚Äôre already active. If not showing as active, I‚Äôm less likely to chat as they may be unavailable. This needs to be corrected.
I text and chat about Messenger for my App. I would like to take messenger from the app store. The group is on the live right now. Good boy Mr Jason, And goodbye Messenger on your computer, I had a review for all the time. I call and saying That Messenger would not work on my Phone. Thank You.
My Messenger always shows that I use the Facebook to chat but I only use my messenger what can I do to fix it ? I use messenger not Facebook plzzz fix it
App is good for being able to make voice and video calls to anyone who uses messenger. Video quality has some issues at times, but otherwise good feature. Like being able to know if the person has seen your message or not. Being able to draw on photos is awesome!! Fix issue with stickers: app not keeping stickers & continues to need downloads for stickers that have been used.
Please - please -  please add Auto reply to personal messenger. I get fat too many business messages with no way to stop them on days off! Business side has auto reply.
This app is great
And lacks privacy! Removed
When I get a message from a friend, I receive two notifications: one that the friend has sent me a message, and a second with the contents of the message. The former notification is obviously redundant since I can infer from the second message that a friend has messaged me... I end up with a phone screen clogged with unnecessary notifications. It‚Äôs stupid.
Best way to keep in touch with your friends.
They are saying on the news that workers at Facebook can tap into your camera and microphone and see what you are doing... what you look up etc... I‚Äôve noticed when I mention a product it starts showing up ads for it and if I put a date or time it wants to schedule a reminder for me... hmmm do we really Want people seeing what we do... hearing what we say?  Any app that asks to use camera or microphone can do this too... deleting messenger soon...
Love this app! It's great. I would recommend it to anyone
I just returned from Dickey in Ashburn VA Best Ribs ever Fall off the bone good  Sailnjmom 
Where‚Äôs the photo effects button, I can‚Äôt find it
Muy bueno y divertido.
Audio clips from my voice memo wont upload. It says to check mu connection but I‚Äôm on wifi. Can you please take a look @ it?? Thank you
I see it notify that I sent the message so it comes up as like an unread message that's annoying it makes me think I missed something then to delete conversations it hesitates or takes too much to do when you have a few convos in one day just a swipe and delete like before was quick and easy. And you allow spam to come in messenger I get messages from ppl that I don't know got my information
It does not work well with the Bluetooth headset. Sometimes, even if the headset is connected, the voice is heard only on the phone speakers. If I couldn‚Äôt talk wireless, what do you think I bought Bluetooth for?
Love the app. Super easy to stay connected with like everybody. I tell me to contact me through messenger instead of texting.
I‚Äôm inundated with ads/sponsored content everywhere else, now I have them interrupting my messenger inbox. Really?
üëçüèªüëåüèª
I just called the Mn attorney general office Lori Swanson - John again. I Told them that you are blocking me again for absolutely no reason. No terms violation. No spam   They have sent you 4 letters now and Facebook appears to be refusing to respond to our government's request as to why Facebook is profiling and discriminating against me.

The app layout is kinda like FB but with a bunch of crap around it.  I DONT WANT NOTIFICATIONS!!! I don‚Äôt want to be asked every single time to turn them on. And what the hell is this background sneaking in on me uninvited?!?! 
I haven‚Äôt been able to receive my messages on my business page.  How am I suppose to have good response time when it notifies you that a message has been sent but you can‚Äôt find the messageüò†. Please fix this problem!
Well i love messenger so much because of its way on how it connects me and my friend even if were afar but theres a problem. The Myday thing is available in my phone but in my mini ipad, it doesn‚Äôt appear. Pls add a MyDay In mini Ipads so i can ejoy it without using my Phone.
There‚Äôs a bug on the Apple Watch version
I love the fact that you guys added the games to the messenger app but the app won‚Äôt let me watch any videos on any of the games. Can you fix it. I would appreciate it.
Facebook basically collects all our information. This is horrible. No privacy.
the previos was the best
I‚Äôd like the iPhone to have the chat bubble like Samsung that would be great.
I am in Mexico, on Holiday. Did a 3 way chat with friend in USA and England. Great sound and picture. We were all thrilled‚Äî however, I disconnected, but, my two friends were unable to do so‚Äî they finally turned their phones off.  My WIFI actually went out( here in Mexico)‚Äî that disconnected me‚Äî how, and what do we look for when trying to disconnect from a 3 way chat.  I never had a problem with one on one‚Äî but, they are hesitant to try this again. Please help us‚Äî absolutely love Messenger
Please respect people privacy
Since last update it keeps on crashing when opening shared images.
It works fine
Why in the hell do we need 2 applications? I simply hate having to go from on to another. Of course it‚Äôs not hard, but why make things a two step process?
I‚Äôm a really sentimental person so I like to look at old messages, but don‚Äôt want to scroll forever to find a specific one. Can you add a messages search feature where I can select a conversation and search with keywords/phrases (i.e ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù)?
I just updated and the messenger app deletes parts of the conversations and slowly sends messages.
It‚Äôs been a few months where only some of my contacts are able to message me. Some can see but not reply and others can‚Äôt even send then I get the invitation to join messenger. So frustrating...
Does nothing but crash and is super glitchy. Still wondering why I have to have a separate app just for messages. This thing takes up too much room on my phone in the first place.
Each time I open the app I get a pop up telling me to turn on notifications.  I don't want that feature active.  But the pop up continues to irritate me!!!
Not able to delete search history & volume issues.
How do I delete messages after reading?
can you please fix this app . i can't post videos , it doesn't post , all it says is "video not able to post"
You should have an option to opt out of the app. Instead you are forced to have the app even when you don‚Äôt use messenger. I hate being messaged in there it‚Äôs extremely dreadful trying to check it. You have to sift through the spam just to get a real message.
Because the Pages app is way broken, I was excited that messenger was handling my business messenger now. Until I began being unable to read or reply to new messages. I now have to handle all my business on my laptop, which is not acceptable in this time of needing to reply to potential customers immediately
I cannot get the red ‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù badge to go off so I deleted the app from my phone.
Please fix the bug on the Facebook messenger. I can‚Äôt read some of my chat. When I try to open the app, the messages are slow to update and scroll up and down. I restarted my cell phone and app.
There are some troubles while I'm writing in iphone x just in messenger app!!!
Since my iPhone just updated it will not upload messenger as well as other apps
I enjoyed being able to add little stickers or look up different fonts to decorate a picture. With the new update, very limited choices and no option to search for any. I really don't want to add another app just for that function.  Thank you
Please let users customize their notification sounds!
Hi! For the past month or so, every time I try to send a picture through messenger, the app closes. Today it closed out and didn‚Äôt send the message. When I tried to open the app back up, it wouldn‚Äôt open. I just deleted it and am reinstalling it. I have the latest update, but this has been happening for about a month as far as not being able to send pictures through the app. Thanks!
Pretty much anyone can hack into this app. If you use Facebook on a PC or Mac, it‚Äôs pretty secure. The smart phone app is ridiculously open for all to view.
Messaging doesn‚Äôt connect well, and there should be a verification feature to make a call or video call.. to avoid calling someone accidentally
But still bad. Apple Watch app has been broken for months
Cool app it needs more features like video chat and more and a new start up feeling and better improvements and video chat aka face time also it should have ditch user mode do you do not have type in the user name and password just click on the picture to log in to that account also needs new super features like add it to the I macs or something and FaceTime video calling. Make video call better. I‚Äôm having my problom I can‚Äôt hear ringing for video calls and there is no answering machine thing.
Cmon it been months now, get it together fools
When you have this app installed, you are agreeing to let Facebook, the government, and whoever else is tied into this privacy breach, watch you and your surroundings through your phone. They can and will use your camera and mic to spy on you at any time. If you need to view a message, I suggest you delete after it‚Äôs viewed or to be safe just don‚Äôt use this all together!
Pleas add the unsend feature sometimes you send a thing and you cant unsend it
I miss the option to make wacky edits on my photos. Now it‚Äôs just bland, you can‚Äôt search for certain stickers anymore such as a thought bubble. ü§¨ü§¨
Absolute asinine I need this app to access my messages. Facebook is cancer and collecting your data and information
I‚Äôve noticed since the last update I‚Äôm not getting notified at all even with all my notifications on and running.  Can you check this please?
I will never download this again. Several people getting hacked through the app. Also Facebook will not allow you to have messenger without a verified phone number. Facebook also back doors you into slowly making profile more public with every post. Hopefully one day Facebook learns what privacy is
It‚Äôs getting way too convoluted and cluttered. There‚Äôs a reason cleaner apps like Slack are so popular.
Need to fix messenger I got hacked and can‚Äôt fix it !
If there is one thing that needs to be fixed is that after downloading the app. I still get invited to download this app. It‚Äôs really annoying. Fix this!!
I deleted it and I‚Äôm trying to get it back but keeps asking for a payment method. I don‚Äôt understand why if it‚Äôs free. I just want my messenger back !
What kind of messaging system doesnt allow you to DELETE MESSAGES? Yea im sure everyone wants their inbox full of new friend connection requests ...üôÑ
Nomas se la pasan cagandola con sus actualizaciones
Why does there even have to be a whole other app just to message on Facebook
Don‚Äôt show ‚Äú___ is active‚Äù in the status bar. That space is not for you to spam me. Also, the push notification icon count on Iphone Home screen keeps re-animating and showing the same number when I press home button and leave the app.
Why not have Messenger Lite, Messenger Call, etc. I don‚Äôt use a fraction of this app and it‚Äôs just growing monstrous and slow.
You can‚Äôt stop your Facebook friends from knowing when were you last seen!!! It says active now, active 30 mins ago!!! And I deleted messenger but still when I log to Facebook it shows active a min or whatever... very frustrating
Hate that i am obligated to download this horrible app. Ridiculous.
This app forces you to use it and it grants permission to listen to your calls Why???  Scandalous 
Messenger keeps making all my friends vanish if they are Active on Chat!   Please fix this bug but keep those little green timers on because those are fantastic!
I don‚Äôt like having new people on my page that I do not know random people are assigned to my list.just because someone is a friend of a friend doesn‚Äôt mean they have to be on my list or added to my page. This is a violation of my privacy and there is no way to delete them. So I turned off messenger until you fix this error.  Good by Messenger! 
As time goes on Messenger adds more useless features that only convolute the experience while at the same time stripping away useful features. For example, swipe to delete was added in 2013, but now it has been removed. To delete conversations you know must tap and hold, select delete and then confirm the deletion, making deleting multiple conversations a chore!  Swiping now switches you from camera, chats, people, groups and calls which are completely different order than the the bottom menu which has home, people (again), camera (again), games and discover. Completely inefficient waste of space and convoluted. Messenger devs, get your heads out of the "oven"!
It‚Äôs not telling me when someone is calling me
Since the last update that was put out, each time I try to open a message it crashes. It works on the Apple Watch Series 3 however, but this is not an ideal solution. Needs to be fixed as soon as possible.
Needs updated looked the same for years let go
I hate this app and how Facebook forces it upon people. It is honestly more of an annoyance than a benefit. It is pretty slow, and not really user friendly. I have deleted it countless times, as I rarely use it.
It did work well. Now it thanks me for installing it and asks me to enter a code sent to my phone, but no text comes.
The app started freezing and having issues loading about a week ago I have re-downloaded this app multiple times now. Everything else on my phone works correctly and my IOS is up to date. Is there a fix?!
Way too many notification for one. This person joined messenger blah blah. Second, having to have a whole different app from Facebook JUST to read messages. Dumb. Annoying. And serves no purpose except to use extra space on my phone. Ohh and if I delete messenger, I just have endless notifications on my Facebook in the upper right hand corner telling me I have messages, but can't even read the messages UNLESS you have the messenger app. I really hate it.
I‚Äôm so sick and tired of these groups messages and the people who send them! How do i delete them?
I was hacked on messenger.
before, messenger was awesome. I‚Äôm the type of person who uses emojis; I remember before like months ago you had this emoji style where in the emojis kinda looked ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù. I don‚Äôt exactly like how they look now and I wish you could just change them back. It frustrates me knowing you‚Äôll probably won‚Äôt see this. Please, just change it back to the good smooth emojis.
My app hasn‚Äôt been working for the past few day. I keeps kicking me off the app and I have important messages to get to. Not to message I hate how Apple is forcing credit card information for apps that are free. I hope you guys fix what ever is causing me these problems.
I only downloaded to see my messages on my mobile device. But I‚Äôm always being added to random group chats with no way to stop it. I can‚Äôt just mute the convo forever. And when I delete it it just makes a new group the next day. I can‚Äôt mark all my messages as read and I get a lot of unwanted messages that I don‚Äôt actually want to read.
Dear Facebook,  Fix the goddamn problem. It started this morning, after opening the fb messenger within 2 seconds it crashes. I deleted and reinstalled with no improvement.  Pathetic! 
I need my privacy.. upgrade to where I feel safe that no one is looking through my camera etc. I‚Äôve heard bad stuff about this app. That you have no privacy when you use the Messenger app.. WhatsApp is the same situation because FB owns that app as well.. good luck! All I ask for is my Privacy.
How can I give Kudos to your Great App. I use it to connect with my sis anytime of the day and the service is excellent in ALL aspects! Same with group chat with friends and family!!! Thank you ! Aloha ! Salamat !
Stupid app keeps trying to force me to allow notifications  Also hate how fb now requires this app to see messages. What garbage. Would give 0 stars if I could 
Why is the app not downloading
So my phone decided to update messenger which is alright but too bad you cant send messages or anything now because it claims the internet connection isn‚Äôt working or it asks you to verify your phone everytime i try to go on to send a message, not working now lol update it
I can only get the notifications. I can‚Äôt respond to the message. üëéüèº Fix it!!!!
919 6508194
Extremely slow and laggy to the point it‚Äôs unusable even with a good device. Especially if you use group chats. Worst app in the App Store. The only reason why it‚Äôs so high up is because Facebook forces you to use it to communicate. I could make a better app in my sleep.
The red exclamation point remains on the account unless all notification setting are on is really annoying, especially for someone who is a bit ocd and hates unaddressed notifications.  Facebook, let the user decide the notifications and don‚Äôt annoy the user into having us be notified as you want
Why can‚Äôt we just add this onto the original Facebook app instead of making a whole other app? And I hate getting notifications saying ‚Äú you and (friend‚Äôs name) are now connected on messenger). And nobody uses the ‚Äústories‚Äù feature.
Tengo las notificaciones de sonido desactivadas y a√∫n as√≠ cuando alguien me llama por la app suena y eso no me gustas

I don‚Äôt understand that why people keep sending me the app when im using it.
just delete it . i am trying to like this app . But I deleted it like 30 times last year .  Just bloated app . i have no need to discover things or play games . the two tabs on the right are completely not needed. And you cant delete messages from Market people, like long old boring conversations . 
Not to mention now when you add or accept a friend. It adds it to messenger like a actual message. That you have to delete 1 by 1 cause you can‚Äôt just select and delete everything at once. Waste of time. Awful. Horrible. I‚Äôd hate to be the name behind the invention of messenger. Cause might as well say. PURE LAZY. WORTHLESS.
My Facebook Stories are not showing up in the Messenger app.
Can u plz add a button or an option to where if u have a long conversation u can skip to the beginning it takes so long to scroll up can u please add this feature
I‚Äôve been using this app for a while now but just recently it has stopped loading my messages. I can‚Äôt even see who‚Äôs active. I can‚Äôt send messages I can only recieve them. I can‚Äôt make calls or pick them up. Please fix this problem. FIX YOUR APP!!!
Can you please update? I can't recieve any messages right now. I restarded my phone already. My notification on my setting is on on messenger but still i cant recieve any messages. Please!!!! I hate it.
I use this app daily and love it. It‚Äôs always up and running.  My only issue is that I keep getting invited to use Messenger when I‚Äôve used the app for years!  It‚Äôs annoying and no idea how to stop the requests.
Could you please release an update that uses the facial cameras on the iPhone X to allow Animojis in messenger because I‚Äôm sure not everybody uses iMessage and also because non of my friends even have iMessages
i havent had my laptop for 2 weeks and there‚Äôs no way for me to check my fb messages on my phone
Please bring back the frog emoji, my girlfriend discovered that you can no longer set the chat emoji to a frog and it's seriously distressing them so please work on that and get rid of one of the more useless emojis like the heel or key or something. This is very urgent please they've probably already cried like twice so please fix this thank you so much, the dolphin emoji just isn't the same
Ok, so now I‚Äôm not getting all of my notifications.  I get messages haphazard notifications.  Sometimes I get them, sometimes I don‚Äôt.   Come on guys, we know you can do better!   So now messenger can‚Äôt be used unless we log in directly through FB.  OMG üò°  You screwed up messenger.  Now I can‚Äôt load it and I can‚Äôt log into my other account AT ALL.   PLEASE FIX IT!!!  And when you do updates make sure they work before you roll them out.   This is so frustrating! ‚ÄúUnexpected Log In Error Occurred.  Please try logging in again.‚Äù üò° I should NOT have to log into FB to be able to log into messenger. 
It shouldn‚Äôt be rocket science to delete some stupid conversation. Make it more user friendly to delete messages and INCLUDE deletion without opening conversations!
I wish it would just let me use messaging on the facebook app. Also it will not allow me to turn off notifications for someone calling me AT ALL!!! This is a horrible nuisance!!!!
When face book started it wAs great. Every day I would look  forward to getting pictures of my grandchildren & messages from personal friends. I would wake up & spend 15 minutes responding or deleting the occasional ad.  Then I got sick & when I returned to Facebook there were ads ads  more ads & lists of people    That I should be friends with & pictures & messages from people added without my consent.  Now I rarely go on face book I just look at the stock quote. I bought it from the ground so I wish it well 
Ur stupid drawing thing doesnt work for me. It glitches and freezes and also DOESNT EVEN FREAKIN WORK SOMETIMES!!!! U should work better on tht and try not to rush like stupid apple company
App freezes and crashes when I use GIFs on my iPhone X, and also holding the microphone button stops working after a few seconds and cuts me off. But other than that the app is good.
I use this app a lot. Some days it's great, other times it says my message was delivered but it can take hours for the person I'm sending it to to receive it. Seems to be worse when sending a message to someone with an android phone. Very frustrating. I've had this problem with a few people. And of course it's gonna happen when I need to get a hold of someone who's phone number I don't have so I can't call or text. Very annoying. It got better on a previous update and now it's bad again. Not thrilled.
Why y‚Äôall removed the augmented retro glasses filter? Please put it back. It‚Äôs the black and white filter with three types of black framed glasses.
Ok so when someone tries to call me on messenger, I get no notification, except when it's over. All I get is: __ tried to call you. What help is that? Then I try to call back and they don't pick up. There is literally one person that calls me on this app, one thing I use it for, and it's f*cked up. The call quality is pretty good tho so I'd give the app a 4 but until this bug is fixed it remains a 2.
This is the 3rd time I‚Äôve had to delete the app and login again to see if it will actually work. It‚Äôs very frustrating that I can‚Äôt even message someone back. All it does is that it looks like it‚Äôll load but it doesn‚Äôt and it ends up ‚Äúcrashing.‚Äù Would love if this problem would get fixed
New iOS 11 is trash
Used to use this with my iOS 5.1.1 Facebook but you guys stopped supporting it. I undownloaded now
The app was good , the design was okay , but I am experiencing a problem with signal , Sometime it was unusable to call and that really annoying for me. The biggest problem for me is : Prompt never show up , every time someone make a call , I‚Äôd barely never receive it , And that make me Miss-call All The Time! The notification was delayed and sometime did not send in time. Making miscommunication and misunderstanding for both sides.  I am using the latest iOS.  Should add feature :  - Full dark mode compatible.  - Photo viewing mode option. (Sometime it really hard to find a photo)  - Network indicator from both-side   - Full picture quality sending option.  Must Fix :  - Notification problem.   - Calling problem. 
So just a heads up, Fox News just posted a video with a tech expert that looked at this app speck by speck and what messenger is doing now is stealing your information and taking pictures of you and your surroundings without you knowing. So some creep can be looking at your private life without you knowing. Please review terms of use and privacy notifications before downloading this app. They have access to you contacts, phone calls, text messages, google searches and pictures that are randomly taken by your camera without your notice! Just FYI FOR ALL USERS.
No funciona con mi IPhone X solo puedo mandar textos pero no llamadas a ning√∫n lado muy malüò†üëé
Why cant i delete a whole conversation?? Who says i want to just delete one message at a time. Can anyone help with this issue, because my inbox is full of useless messages.
There is NO SOUND!!!!!!! Needs to be FIXED, Please!?!?!?
I updated the ap and now it keeps crashing üò©üò© it takes a long to to respond to messages when it doesn‚Äôt crash. Fix it, come on now!
I hate having this app because of all the background info collecting it does. Listening to conversations and possibly going through emails and texts to collect personal data. It's just not fair that they force you to install this app. I should be able to use Facebook in a browser on mobile without having to install the separate app.
This apps needs a sounds alert changer because it doesn‚Äôt have one and needs it ASAP
A few of my family members have been hacked recently. This is crazy like how is there not protection from these kinds of things??? You really should update and fix this problem because a lot of people are deleting this app for this reason.
Messenger is a great app. However with the latest update typing a message can be a pain. Just randomly the stickers will pop up and there is no way to close them. You have to copy what you have, exit out of the app, and come back in for it to reset. My wife has the same issue on her phone. A major pain!
I only download this app when some one on Facebook messages me. Everytime I re-download the app I have to be careful not to let this app manipulate me into downloading my contacts and sharing my cellphone so anyone can ‚Äútext‚Äù me. Mind ya business. I then open the message and It‚Äôs usually something like an invitation from someone selling Lula Roe junk at some virtual party. Then I delete the app.  Pain in the arse. I don‚Äôt want a separate app. I don‚Äôt want people to see if I‚Äôm ‚Äúlive‚Äù or ‚Äúactive‚Äù at the moment.
No I do not want to turn on notifications, stop asking me. I don't want to show whether or not I'm online either.
Well, Facebook developers are doing the idiotic now and including people as active that are no longer active -- uselessly cluttering the active list.  When not just create another group/list for very recently active (say 1-10 minutes).  This is now on top of it is so irritating to not be able to delete folks you would care not to have anymore contact with.   This is a major flaw -- if you can add, you should be able to delete folks.   Why is this missing?? 
For some odd reason im not getting my messages because on Facebook it‚Äôs saying I have 29 messages and every time I access my messenger there be nothing new messages that‚Äôs my only problem
I don‚Äôt mind using this app. But the problem is deleting the conservation on here is nil. If I can delete text message on my phone then why I can‚Äôt delete it on here. Total waster of time and space.
I can‚Äôt put the volume down anymore and it‚Äôs to loud for my liking. Please fix this as soon as you can.
Please fix this!   Thank you! 
When I have more than one photo in my story, half the time the story closes after just the first photo and I can't view the other photos unless I restart the app.
Cant see last active for some users some of the time, very inconsistent. I still show available when I have all apps logged out
Ads do not enhance my experience nor would customized ads. I'm just a lil tired of being bombarded with advertising everywhere and everything gotta generate money. I can't blame them but I can definitely stop using their app. Sighs~ privileged problems...
The app is slow, when your on video chat it  always crashes and it kicks me from the chat every 5 minutes, please do all of us a favor and fix it
Idiotic that you cant even sign out.
Christina
Very disappointed with the games part, in every game there is an option to watch a video to get more coins/lives/points but that feature keeps saying it's unavailable...why have the option if it's not a functioning option?? Get with the program and fix it!
Keyboard won‚Äôt pop up when you press the text box and when it does show up it blocks the extension icons.
How do I view secret messages that I already set up and now I can‚Äôt  get back into and reply to the secret person
Worthless. Trying to attach pictures crashes the app after most recent update.
I‚Äôve had this app every since it came out and it has never once gave me a problem. But as of yesterday I can‚Äôt access any of my messages. When I open the app, it stays at the loading screen for a few minutes and then will go to my home screen. I‚Äôve uninstalled and reinstalled it three times. I restarted and reset my phone. Nothing is working!
I have downloaded and then later deleted countless versions of this application. Each time I keep hoping it gets improved. The app functions. But 1) I have that it relegated Facebook to needing two (or in the case of Page Manager) three separate applications... all consuming processor resources and battery life/power. It‚Äôs just a sloppy, unsophisticated software design concept.  Now, the application is relentless in continually asking to ‚Äúturn notifications on‚Äù. Not just when you install it. Not even when you start it. But every single time you switch to it.., that‚Äôs multiple times even when the app is already open.   Facebook is fast becoming irrelevant and unimportant, as it appears to be the cave for trolls and religious or political zealots. If it weren‚Äôt for a slight business advantage , I would have already deleted the whole smack. For sure, the Millennials and younger are distancing themselves from FB.   Combine all that, and my review is not to recommend it. I‚Äôm off to delete FB messenger once again. Best of luck to you, should you decide to keep it. 
I can‚Äôt even send a message to someone on Facebook only to someone in my contacts!
Someone hacked into a friend‚Äôs messenger and was trying to talk to me. I knew it wasn‚Äôt her because the person was asking questions supposedly about me. The questions made no sense. I‚Äôm going off messenger for awhile.  HOWEVER. I get messages from Messenger saying I have 4 messages etc. I‚Äôm asked to download messenger to answer them. I‚Äôm staying off for awhile until I hear other legit comments that  things are better on Messenger. 
I want to deactivate my messenger. I used my instagram account to sign up for it since I do not have a Facebook. I now want to deactivate it and I am following the instructions that says to click my profile picture on the left top corner select privacy and terms and then click deactivate. Well of course when I click privacy and terms there is no the deactivate to click on. I tried clicking help center in the app and there‚Äôs no way I can send a message since I do not have a Facebook please help I want to deactivate this messenger
The app itself is fine, I guess. I seldom use it. But I HATE that I am forced to install it if I want to read messages from Facebook on my phone.   This should be part of the Facebook app! It‚Äôs separate because FB wants to be your go to texting service, but that is not going to happen. 
You keep telling m that I have 15 unread messages.  Can‚Äôt load.
They are selling your info to the government, the police, etc. You are not safe.
I avoided this app for a couple years and used Facebook on my phone's Internet browser. And then suddenly I couldn't access messages without downloading this app. Sometimes you can be a real jerk, Facebook.
I enjoy having messenger but too many people abused it. Chain letters and videos that contain viruses constantly arrive in my inbox. Very useful tool but had to delete it. Just too risky! Please re-invent or something
Why am I being forced to provide mobile number
Since I‚Äôve updated I can‚Äôt even see any of my old messages or search for half the people I want to talk to unless they are online. You turned this app into garbage
On iPhone. Other apps let me do it so you can get yours to too! If I could change the sound by which person I get the message from, that would be even better!
There should be a feature in Messenger that recognizes whether a user has Messenger installed already. If they do, then maybe DON'T SEND ME DEEP LINKS TO DOWNLOAD MESSENGER EVERY TIME A FRIEND FAT FINGERS A MESSAGE TO ME!!!
App out there. Ever. I hate having to download messenger just to view my messages and when I do it‚Äôs always something so random I usually delete messenger right away with irritation and always feel like it‚Äôs a waste of time. If you combined your Facebook and messenger app together you would probably get better reviews, but I think you guys like the attention who knows haha. But this app is terrible, I‚Äôd rather be stuck with a glitchy Snapchat or Instagram rather than a full functioning messenger
I can‚Äôt seem to rid myself of certain people, I‚Äôve blocked accounts on Facebook only to find them still connected in messenger.. if I blocked someone , that means I don‚Äôt want to interact with them, but I still have to see you. I don‚Äôt like a person being able to associate themselves with me, unless I welcome it. I hope Facebook will address this and add blocking features directly in messenger so when I take the time to remove a person from my contacts, and block them on Facebook, I won‚Äôt still somehow see them in messenger or any other place on the platform. As of now the only way to remove 1 unwanted guest is to delete my account.. really.. I would have to delete my account? Please fix.. Google plus has a lot more user controls, Facebook and messenger should give more user control.. I‚Äôve deleted 2 accounts already, 1 left.
Sometimes when I press the home button, the app assumes I‚Äôm still in it and doesn‚Äôt send me notifications if I get a message and says I‚Äôve read the message. This has caused problems in many relationships I‚Äôve been in and is very annoying when I‚Äôm trying to talk to someone because I assume they don‚Äôt answer and I just do something else and later find out they had replied and I look like the one who left them on read. Please fix this for the sake of many relationships that get rocky because of this.
Crap
Facebook messenger app keeps freezing & crashing while in use. Several times it has made me go through the set up process all over again as if I deleted the app & just downloaded it. I do not want to have to renter my phone number or FB Login  and password every time I exit then renter the app! Many of my friends have similar issues so it's not a phone issue rather an app issue! It's really annoying & I am seriously considering deleting this app if things don't get better! Please fix these issues so I can continue to message with my friends. üôèüèº
Mine will not let me sign in i have 5 messages i can‚Äôt open
Your app is not sending my messages all the way though!! You need to fix that
I can not update Messenger. There are three different user names that rotate through trying to update or download on my new phone. None of these user names are familiar to me or my family. How would this happen? It does it with Facebook as well. I need to update these two programs
Why can‚Äôt this be a simple app.  Now, I cannot access my messages, see if I‚Äôm considered ‚Äúonline‚Äù, if I want to be offline.  It keeps asking me to log into the web page version of messenger too.  It won‚Äôt let me just go through the app.  It‚Äôs super frustrating and I‚Äôm just going to ditch the app.
Stop being a bully.  Let us message through your site.
Since the new update. My friends are not getting my messages fast. It takes a long time for them to get them.
Every since I updated my IOS everything is separated out. My passwords do not work. If you want my opinion I am blocked out of the cloud/ it takes my pictures/ messages/ and I cannot or they will not give me an option to reset any of them. If I can‚Äôt get them to help me I‚Äôm finished with anything that has an‚ÄùI‚Äù- In front of it! More and more  of MY information is being stolen and it will not let me retrieve my own stuff! 
Messager is easlier for people to hack.  If you look At your security you will see people who have hacked your account without you even knowing it.  I‚Äôve had someone from DallAs Tx who kept hacking into mine until I got rid of my messager!
Do you even hire devs or was this app made by a freeware mobile app? Constantly on a new iPhone i get messages from friends saying. ‚ÄúJohn sent you a message‚Äù but it never shows the message. You had one job, not games and 50 other things, and you fail to do it. Hardly a messenger app, mostly a bloated marketing tool.
No reason to need two apps
Sawfgfiuocjjoxcqtuw dfdq is the dc
Did not work when I bought my watch 3 on release and has yet to work I‚Äôve tried everything from resets to tweaks!
Facebook disable the texting function on the tab and force users to download this junk. Now you installed this app, and you do not want it to push notification. It will give you a big red "!" in the menu, and there is no way you can dismiss it. Let's uninstall this app together and using other app instead!
It's a great app on my iPhone but REFUSES to launch on my Apple Watch! I can receive messages on my watch but I can't get the app to open so I can reply! I've tried uninstalling and then putting it back on but no such luck. FIX THIS!
Bring back the ability to see past pictures you have sent in a chat. It‚Äôs irritating to not be able to view them quickly like before.
I hate the new app. It‚Äôs difficult to find anything. Change it back
We don‚Äôt need yet another chat app. We also don‚Äôt need one that continuously alerts you that you have an unread message from a chat app you AREN'T USING and haven‚Äôt installed!  We have reached the age where we are being forced to take every new idea (regardless of its use / utility). I despise this app. 
Call fails are so frequent. Once the call fails, my bluetooth headphone doesn‚Äôt work during the call.
As in the title, this app has a lot of bugs and it lacks many necessary features. I am only using it because it‚Äôs it connects me to my Facebook contacts, if it was an independent texting application, i would have never used it. Why when you add someone to a group, they can read every previous message? Why you can‚Äôt delete a message that you have sent (deleting it for the other person)? Why going offline (aka turning off chat) still shows you as ‚Äúactive now‚Äù but only with the green dot disappearing, so you are basically telling people ‚ÄúHey, this person doesn‚Äôt want to chat with you‚Äù? Why does the video call button starts glowing when both you and the other person are opening the chat tab (so i might be reading an old message and the other person would think that i am stalking)? What about the profile picture bug? If someone (me or my friends) changes their Facebook profile picture, it won‚Äôt changes in messenger 99% of the times. Also when going to check pictures in an conversation, they might not load or load slowly. What about the ‚Äúactive 1 minute ago‚Äù? It appears always except if i turn the internet off in my device. All those previous bugs, ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù and other lack of features make the app just horrible. Hope that you fix those bugs and remove those ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù and add other necessary ones. 
Whenever I download this app, my text from other messenger users are not in order!
I think we should be able to actively log out of our messenger accounts instead of having to log into somebody else‚Äôs, resetting the app, or deleting the app completely.
I like this app, but I want Siri to be able to send messages on messenger
No privacy. Everyone has to know if your on or when your were on. Whatever.....not needed folks. 
I‚Äôve used messenger as my main source for communication for years. I honestly love being able to talk with friends while using stickers, colors and a main emoji, etc. But one thing I really loved was being able to chick on the chat name and viewing all the photos we sent of each other. I am genuinely disappointed to see this feature be taken out. I hope to this this come back so I can browse the wonderful photos I‚Äôve shared with my friends.
Luke‚Äôs picture won‚Äôt change
You guys seriously need to put up blocking for calling options on this app, I accidentally called someone I don‚Äôt know in real life and I wasn‚Äôt prompted in any way to say yes or no. That isn‚Äôt cool, I‚Äôm just glad I saw that my phone was ringing so I could stop it myself. PUT UP A CALL BLOCKING OPTION FOR USERS WHO DON‚ÄôT WANT TO CALL FRIENDS THEY DO NOT KNOW IN REAL LIFE!
HATE that you make me download this stupid app instead using Messenger within Facebook.
We used to be able to slide a conversation to the left with the option to delete conversation or block another user from FB or just from messaging you.   More importantly, without that feature it forces us to open a message if we want to delete conversation or block user. I have countless messages I do not want to open which makes them sit there in my face forever.  Please bring that feature back 
I have had excellent service and they perform well on all things I have had performed.    1) Tires 2) Front end repair wheel bearings.  Pricing below all other shops  3) New Brakes completed today   4). I recommend everyone use them at least check competitors.  You will come back to them. 
would give no stars if possible, can‚Äôt even use the app
It doesn‚Äôt load. When it does load it crashes and fails to load properly.  Also, how many times does this app have to ask ‚Äúturn on notifications?‚Äù   I always say no but it still asks multiple times. You decline it and literally the next question it asks again.   I shouldn‚Äôt have to refuse notifications every time I open this app. So I just uninstalled it. 
This app just gets worst by the days apparently it just doesn't work after a while no connection poor video quality notifications are terribly slow  if your gonna force and app make sure it‚Äôs superior
When an app forces you to update in order to open, I get annoyed. When that update won‚Äôt open and crashes, never to open again...I quit.  Deleting this app from my phone. 
I like the App. It‚Äôs pretty simple to use. My only complaint is there is no way to delete multiple conversations.
I‚Äôm trying to get back into messenger but it won‚Äôt let me it said I was hacked and needed to to change my password so I did but I still can‚Äôt get into messenger so can you help me with this by figuring out what to do thanks.
I do not get incoming calls. Only notifications that I missed on. Also, the entire layout is horrendous. The reverse camera option moves between 2 locations. Put this back to being only on the bottom row. If I wanted to use so many filters I would use snap chat. At this point, if things aren‚Äôt fixed I will just go with Skype. That and the battery usage is killing my phone!!
Why does Facebook require this stupid glitchy app to get messages? It always messes with my keyboards, freezes, glitches, and basically requires a restart of my phone any time I try to use it. Ditch this stupid app Facebook!!
It‚Äôs very bad that messenger cannot quote a chat.... it‚Äôs very very bad
I swear
Please fix >:(
They don‚Äôt tell us what‚Äôs in the updates on purpose.
Hacked
The app works ok but it‚Äôs irritating when it wants to do things I don‚Äôt care for it to do. Chief among these is that idiotic round button right in the middle of things at the bottom. Can‚Äôt believe how many times I‚Äôve pressed that accidentally. I‚Äôd rather have the skin from several versions back, and without it acting like it‚Äôs the only app on my phone.
How many times do I have to say I don‚Äôt want to get notifications before it stops annoying me?  Hate getting that prompt every time I try to use the app.  The app also took a large amount of phone memory for a simple messenger.  It‚Äôs convenient cause it‚Äôs tied to Facebook but excessive in other regards.  Would recommend using a different messenger or even just texting people.
I like personal messaging
I hate that I am forced to download it  I hate that I can‚Äôt chat IN Facebook and must have separate windows open  I REALLY hate the automatic adding of just anybody and everybody I have ever had email from.  I don‚Äôt even know MOST of the people in my Messenger list.  And most of all, I HATE THAT I CAN‚ÄôT DELETE PEOPLE from Messenger one at a time as I so choose!  This one is connected to the above...add without consent and force to keep in list.  SUQS BIG TIME!!  I LOATHE THIS APP!  If I could do without it, I would.  If I could give it ZERO STARS, I WOULD! 
When is the volume buttons going to adjust the volume while in the video chat? One review was in November yet I think I have updated this several times since. Also Apple hasn‚Äôt locked this down as that apps like YouTube, and Vimeo and others all have this controlled through the buttons. Thanks.
This app is not well designed and it is a pain that you have to have this as a separate app from fb. I never use it unless forced to.
I like it a lot so I can text and call my friends or family. But I had been very laggy and when someone is typing I don‚Äôt see the three little dots. I want to see the three little dot
Unless I‚Äôm holding my phone in my hand or it is sitting right next to me I can‚Äôt hear it when someone calls me to video chat.  Yet if that same person calls me on a phone call it‚Äôs super loud.  ?????
I uninstalled Messenger but I still see messages in Facebook (upper right corner). How do I disconnect messenger completely? Irritating!
No audio for videos or voice messages.
Y'all really gonna make us update the app now. Take away the stupid pop up update crap. Its annoying. The app isnt worth having if yall just gonna make me update it.
I hate this effing app. It was so much easier to have it part of the fb app itself instead of eating space on my phone.
I haven't updated the app in a year because I know, I just know, they still haven't added support for sending a picture from your Photo Stream or other album instead of just the Camera Roll. Any other app can do this. How does one of the biggest tech companies, aside from Google, not manage to program in this tiny little hook?? Still not updating until that and normal update change logs are put back in place. I don't care how many times the app asks me to update. 
The app just keeps loading up and I can click on anything
Keeps inserting question mark in place of letter i
facebook‚Äôs true colors always shine through
They send out updates every 2 weeks just to use up space in ur phone! It‚Äôs the biggest app I‚Äôve got and I‚Äôve got 130. Apps are getting paid by phone makers to send junk updates every 2 weeks to fill ur phone up so u will have to buy new phones. They can‚Äôt even tell u exactly what‚Äôs in updates. FRAUD!!
Why does this need a separate app?? Can you just add it to our Facebook app?
My messages are unable to be delivered and every time I send a message the app crashes and uninstalls.
I got hacked and don‚Äôt know how to fix it.
I HATE FB MESSEGER!!!!!! Why do I need a separate app to open messages ! Grow tf up Facebook!
I absolutely hate the idea of having a separate app for messages from Facebook. Nevertheless I don‚Äôt understand why it keeps spamming me while I‚Äôm on the app to turn on the notifications after selecting no several times. Mind you I only had it open for a total of 3 minutes.
After every single call, I need to tell you the quality of the call? You don‚Äôt have embedded technology to assess the call‚Äôs quality by now? Please stop asking me. I will start giving you the lowest possible rating if you keep asking me and it will not be a reflection of the call quality.
How do you delete people you mistakenly added to Messenger? I don't like the whole thing.
Stop playing ads in the middle of the videos I'm trying to watch it's so annoying play them in the beginning like a normal app
Seems since I‚Äôve had to use this stupid app by force I‚Äôve lost control of what I can do with whom I choose to speak to. Also it seems I‚Äôve been getting hacked more than ever before especially with those ‚Äúplease keep these going‚Äù messages. Unfuck us please Facebook.
It is extremely intrusive! I don‚Äôt want everyone knowing everything or seeing everything I have! Facebook forces you to use it.
I don‚Äôt understand why this app needs to know my location when I‚Äôm not using it? Also why access my microphone while I‚Äôm not using it? Crazy violation of privacy.
Latest update is garbage constantly crashes and freezes
I deleted this once because I started to receive chain letters non stop from my friends and they were not sending them. This became very irritating.
So I've started messenger and whenever o add a person they don't seem to get my request and I can't message them because it says 'send failed or they aren't available when they really are..
Would love to delete read messages but the app either doesn't allow you to delete messages or doesn't make it obvious how to do so.    I only use the mobile app so won't be doing it on the full site if it's a feature there.    Please add that function 
My messenger app won‚Äôt even load, it has a loading symbol but won‚Äôt show me anything no messages at all. Which is really starting to irritate me. I‚Äôve unplugged my WiFi etc, turned my phone off & deleted the app and reinstalled it. FIX IT
The volume so low, we have to tried to call too many times to get the right volume when im video chatting with my friend i cant even hide my self to my friends. Everytime i open my Facebook i would be active on messenger too. People think im always busy talking on messenger cuz my status is always active. If there is a way to keep my self invisible to people so that i have my privacy wheather im talking to people or not on facebook.
Far too many fraudulent messages and people posting under other people's Facebook profilesüëéüëéüëé
1st some of those stickers are so adorable. 2nd I love how I can send as many pictures as I want at once oh my lord it is the best thing in the world this is one of the only messaging apps I can do that...üíïüíïüíïüíï 
There needs to be a simple way to turn off the little green light that shows everyone when ur logged onto facebook. This is the reason i deleted the messenger app.
I‚Äôm just now leaving the store on E. Colonial Dr. and once again the staff has been outstanding. I‚Äôm still looking for my boots, didn‚Äôt find him on this visit. Ashley and Bree are the young ladies that helped me, again very, very nice and professional.   It‚Äôs always fun coming in the store and finding things that are unusual and that fit.  I‚Äôll keep coming back, hopefully my pre-owned boots will be!   Respectfully,  a 60 yr old female customer.... 
It fills up my inbox with a generic message forcing me to make a conversation with a new friend. Chill FB!
There needs to be a delete button for messages we don‚Äôt wish to read!
No issues with messenger what so ever. But if I could appear offline and still be able to message people. That would be awesome and would earn a definite 5 starts from me!!
Al estar en una video llamada permitir que la c√°mara se quede activa todo el tiempo y poder entrar a otras apps y no se quite por favor tengo un iPhone y no se puede en verdad desear√≠a que arreglaran eso
They should add an alert telling you if the person you texted saw the message or not. Like get an alert saying ‚ÄúJohn Smith viewed your text message‚Äù
When attempting to edit the location of a "plan" without location services turned on, the keyboard pops up and a window saying I should enable location services under it. There's nothing I can do to close the keyboard or the window so I have to force quit the app.
Im having problems when I receive messages back from people! Their messages come in the order that looks like they sent it to me first. Can you fix this?
Sheeshhhhhh.
After the last update the screen often freezes even if I restart the application it won‚Äôt work sometimes it also shuts down on its own. I hope you fix it
I think it‚Äôs very annoying that you have to download messenger just to check messages from friends. What‚Äôs more frustrating is that I can‚Äôt download things when I‚Äôm not over WiFi, so if I check Facebook and see that someone messaged me, I have to wait until I get home, just to check my messages. I think there should be messenger, but there should also be an option to check Facebook without having to download messenger. It‚Äôs very annoying to me and other usersüëéüèª this idea that someone came up with isn‚Äôt smart and they aren‚Äôt thinking about other peopleüëéüèªand what is the point of making a Facebook app if you can‚Äôt use it to message people??? This forces me and other people to take up room on their devices. Whoever decided to have it done this way is an idiot.
I absolutely despise this app. I hate that Facebook forces you to have it, forces you to turn on notifications even when you click ‚Äúno,‚Äù and wants your personal information, such as your cell phone number. I do not want to download this app and I cannot check messages without either downloading this app or using my laptop, which is annoying and incredibly inconvenient.  I do not like feeling manipulated by technology, and this is a form of manipulation. This app should be optional, not a requirement. 
Every time I open messenger it force closes.
Facebook is engaging in some pretty dark patterns within and around this app: - On a mobile browser, the user cannot use the Facebook messages feature. It only directs the user to the Messages app. This is not a technical limitation; it‚Äôs by design. - The mobile app is _very_ heavy handed in trying to get the user to enable push notifications. It requires at least 3-4 taps to get past the initial nags, then every time thereafter when the user opens the app, it nags the user to enable push notifications. - I didn't wait around to experience more. The above was enough for me. App deleted. 
I would like to copy part of the text that is sent to me. Instead of being able to choose the text it gives me opportunity to add a smiley faces to that text. Don‚Äôt need that.
The camera doesn't work when using it to add to my "My Day". Furthermore, it lags such that the app crashes. Please fix ASAP.
It tries to download all old messages from the last time you used the app. It doesn‚Äôt send any new messages until the app is fully synced and it only sends new messages once the app is open on the iPhone
I cant use a custom tone for incoming messages. Now I can't turn off my activity either. Please fix it in the next update.
The absolute worst social media site and no support. Locks my account constantly, yet can‚Äôt seem to stop live streaming murders.
For the constant updates that it has weekly, it needs work. I wish there was a feature where I could hide ‚ÄúAdd to your story‚Äù feature, I don‚Äôt use it, nor do I care for it. I would love to log out from messenger from time to time too. I do not understand why I can‚Äôt. It is annoying. Adjustment to the volume feature for messenger calls would also be helpful. It fluctuates from low to high and it is difficult to adjust it at times. Also call quality is sometimes poor even when connected to WiFi.
What ever happened to my shared photos feature? I lost a lot of photos when I had my phone stolen and I had sent so many precious memories to my friends via this app, but when I went to try and retrieve some pictures, some of my contacts no longer have the ‚Äúshared photos‚Äù feature; what‚Äôs up with that?  I also hate how I have to manually scroll through conversations to find something. And the fact I‚Äôm forced to use the Messenger app in lieu of the old messages function which had more OPTIONS and control.   Furthermore, I can‚Äôt search through conversations on mobile. So frustrating! I don‚Äôt want to have to scroll for five hours just to find something. 
I redownloaded the app multiple times and am still completely unable to use it
Seems like a stupid thing to complain about but I've heard for a while now that iPhone users would be able to have the option to select a different ringtone for messenger like android users can and it still has yet to happen. Why is that when this app updates all the time yet you can't ever tell what has been updated on it? It's very annoying honestly if you're going to update it why not take into consideration the things that people are complaining about...that to me makes more sense than these updates that literally provide us with the exact same app.
it freezes and exits please fix this in next update. iphone 6s.
Please, please, please give us some options for the notification ding.  It is annoying as all get out, can‚Äôt hear it and can‚Äôt distinguish one ding from another with different people and devices in the house.
Don‚Äôt try to reach all your friends on a holiday . They block you and don‚Äôt let you back in . No way to get help nothing . And then all your friends send you holiday greetings and you can‚Äôt respond so they think u hate them . It‚Äôs really bad what face book does to people. Yet they let bad evil people post ungodly stuff . But don‚Äôt try to stay connected with your friends . Worthless app
I‚Äôve tried to use the messenger on the Apple Watch and it doesn‚Äôt work at all!! Needs to be updated to a newer version immediately!!
Will never load conversations. Overall trash
Every time I open this damnable app it asks me to enable notifications. STOP ASKING! I DON‚ÄôT WANT MY PHONE BEEPING EVERY 5 MINUTES! It should only  ask once!
Sends useless notifications. Hate the app and am uninstalling
I get multiple invitations to connect with someone on messenger only to find the message is some chain junk and there‚Äôs no way to block the person from doing it over and over. Often the people are tech-clueless and don‚Äôt know how to ¬´ tame it ¬ª themselves. Since messages has separated from Facebook it‚Äôs awful -and unnecessary.
I cannot see people‚Äôs views when I post on my day. Please fix.
Since I installed the latest update it won‚Äôt let me read my messages it just gives me a spinning blue circle....not cool.
What is this share your daily photos with 20 people. Mine, & other peoples photos disappear and where are they going? I have shown my photos one day & the next day someone in my group is showing the same photos on their photo day‚Äù? That‚Äôs stealing! Also, how do you give a code in the back! Their suppose to text me a code to Put in codes! But I h/   yet to have one sent to me in Messenger! No one sends anything telling you what to do & how! So we guess ? Guessing doesn‚Äôt work! Also! No one on my sight is willing to pay $ on an app that just sores the work! One more thing! WHY DO I HAVE TO GIVE PERMISSION FOR MESSENGER TO HAVE MY CONTACTS LIST? My dentist, my bank, my friends that aren‚Äôt on FB, everyone I know in businesses, things & people you have no right to have on Messenger at all! Isn‚Äôt that an invasion of mine & others Privacy? Not to mention dangerous? 
You have to get this to use Messenger.
There are so many frustrating things with this app. I do not have the Facebook app on my phone for work/life balance as I work with college students so i check it occasionally on my web browser app instead. It annoys the eff out of me that in order to check my messages I have to download the app. Then once I download it, it asks me for basically all of my information REPEATEDLY. No I don‚Äôt want to turn on notifications. No I don‚Äôt want to add my phone number so STRANGERS can call me. That‚Äôs not convenient and I don‚Äôt trust the safety features of Facebook. It‚Äôs intrusive.   Also the fact that there‚Äôs no away message or anything that I can set up. With more and more people using messenger as a replacement for email, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd add some of the work life features. I want to use messenger for work but I don‚Äôt want to be accessed 24/7. And when I go on vacation I want to be able to still message my friends without having clients/customers up my butt for stuff.  Overall there is nothing impressive about this app and it has caused me more frustration than help. I wish Facebook would listen to its users and make messages accessible from the regular Facebook app. 
I can‚Äôt get back in to Messenger
It‚Äôs got some minor bugs, but it works! You can talk to people on it easily. I like that.
I have many people say they cannot hear me. Think the microphone is in the wrong place. Think it would be better if it were on the left side of the phone. That way you can hear and be able to talk without adjusting where you put the phone. The sound isn‚Äôt very loud even when I up the sound . Hope you have a solution for this problem, Thanks, Monica Eskridge . Happy Year....
Why does the App allow me to set the notifications I wish to receive, which I only set to badge app icon, then constantly pester me to adjust my settings for more notifications? I‚Äôll tell you why, it‚Äôs their way of forcing you to engage this app. I‚Äôm sick of Facebook, if only the rest of the world would get on board.
This app doesn't connect to the internet
Awful, how the heck do I get out
I hate when responding to someone, It takes forever to find their name. 
I keep deleting messenger because I have one friend who continues to send Memes that could contain viruses. There is no way to block her from doing it so I just keep deleting the whole app. Please add a way to block friends from messenger without blocking them on Facebook.
Messages all failed when I try to send one on my iPhone!! Please fix this problem
about this app. I don‚Äôt see the point of installing a separate app just so I can dm someone on fb. Plus I don‚Äôt know how to delete conversations, or do any of the basic functions, and I really don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a complete tech noob. So much complicated and unnecessary nonsense- please stop trying too hard. I really wish the fb can just go back to the way it was back in 2008.
Absolutely terrible. NEVER loads as an app. Will give push notifications, but the processing is so slow that you never get to open your messages.
Audio/video calls don't go through or come in. Tried turning on and off phone, closing app then reopening, switching between cellular and WiFi and nothing works. It has been going on since October. Figured I wait for the update and even then it doesn't work. Will uninstall the app at this point since it doesn't work and is taking up space.
When it comes to this app ‚Äú messenger ‚Äú is tied into these hackers. I do believe. I said that because I had messenger and the nuts poured in. But I got rid of it and no other issues. EXCEPT THE MESSAGES FROM MESSENGER TO GET THIS APP!!  THAT ANSWER IS A GREAT BIG FAT NO! Now to get messenger to STOP THIS CRAP! IVE UNINSTALLED IT DONT HAVE IT BUT STILL GETTING NOTIFICATIONS ON AN APP I DONT HAVE! Omgosh 
I‚Äôm downloading Messenger for one night because I made the mistake of posting an Open House as an event. My real human friends are sending messages to me through FB about my event.  I refuse to carry the additional App on my phone because it was forced upon me so that I can respond to messages (to which I was previously able to respond within the FB App). So uncool in the name of progress.
I‚Äôm tired of getting messages and alerts when I no longer have Messenger!!!!!
The  amount of messages needs to be changed. Doing one at a time is extremely time consuming. It takes forever deleting them one by one. Why can‚Äôt they be deleted all at once or by selection like text messaging? I hope this will make the next update...
Why will this stupid app only give me my messages when it's hooked to the internet and not on 4g?
This app is a great messaging app, but it doesn‚Äôt work on my watch the screen is always either loading or stuck on a blank screen
No advantage over email, just an additional place to waste time.
I am one of those OCDers who can‚Äôt handle the red notification bubble, so I check everything and update everything. The constant harassment to ‚Äúturn on notifications‚Äù when I‚Äôve opted not to drives me crazy. I delete the app and then download it when I need it. If I wanted to receive notifications, I would‚Äôve answered yes in the first place.
Requires way too many permissions.  Wants access to all of your private info.
I‚Äôm getting delayed message notices. 12/31/17
Why hasn‚Äôt there been a update?? It‚Äôs been almost 3 weeks and no updates!! What‚Äôs going on??
From the day it was released, to now running on the series 3 Apple Watch, the app simply doesn‚Äôt work. 90% is the time it will not open and simply be in a perpetual loading screen, the other 9% it won‚Äôt refresh and show recent messages. The Apple Watch has out long enough, how have these issues not been fixed?
Started getting repeated notifications from older replies...  Now throwing ads down in the message list?  Thats a blow below. 
I have not noticed Facebook replying to any of the complaints listed here. Why might that be pray tell? 
Can't see my messsges
It‚Äôs all screwed up...it‚Äôll say one person sent a message when it was someone else....it‚Äôll say the wrong message for the notification...or it‚Äôll say something they already said!!! It‚Äôs very annoying!!!!
Please fix the fact that it will tell me the notification over and over, PLEASE FIX
FB Messenger is unresponsive to its users concerns and desires. Being forced into using Messenger is highly unappealing. I use it to see messages that fb alerts me to then delete it. The separate app is fine for people who want it. Being able to send and receive basic text messages WITHIN fb is what a large majority of users want, according to reviews I read. Fb/Messenger could care less!
Please fix. I been receiving notifications but no messages
I Keep Getting Past Messages I Have Already Have Read As Notifications. The Messages Kept Being Sent Even Though I Have Already Read Them On Messenger.
I love this app but some things need to be fixed. I‚Äôm receiving text notifications from conversations that already happened. And when someone texts me, I can‚Äôt see their text in my Notification Center. When I‚Äôm on the phone, sometimes it‚Äôs too loud and I can‚Äôt turn down the volume. I hope this can get fixed. But other than that the app is great!
I keep getting alerts of messages I‚Äôve read an hour ago. Something is buggy.
I want to uninstall messenger and there‚Äôs no icon for it.. and this really sucks‚ÄºÔ∏èü§î
So I had my messenger updated recently and ever since I‚Äôve done it, I keep getting notifications of messages people have already sent me. And I‚Äôm not the only one. My friends have had the same problem too.
There's currently a glitch that's annoying me. It sends me old notifications and I can't receive new ones unless I open the app. Please fix this.
Just updated the app. Keeps notifying me I have a message, and when I go to look there‚Äôs nothing there. Deleted app then re-downloaded it, still have the same problem. Turned off all notifications for it, but the problem overrides the action. Please fix!
My messages are not coming through to the app. This applications purpose if for messaging. After the most recent update only about 1/3 of my messages are coming  to the app.
Easily hacked. The endüò°
I‚Äôm getting notifications for messages I received/read repeatedly. It‚Äôs highly annoying. Fix for higher rating
Messages don‚Äôt always appear & volume is always too quiet or too loud even with headphones in or out
Needs a bug update
Tired of getting notifications of a message over and over again and the person has not sent me anything! Fix it!
It‚Äôs not letting my messages deliver. This is what I use to talk to all my friends. Fix it
I‚Äôm getting notifications for old messages! Please fix
Somebody can got your information people
For whatever reason I get notifications multiple times about the same message (preview) even ten mins to an hour later. This is after I‚Äôve already read responded and the conversation has continued for moved on. This happens when someone reads a message or sends me a message from a different convo. It‚Äôs annoying. Please fix.
Things are not loading right and it's constantly sending me double notifications or sending me notifications of messages that don't appear when i go to the app üò°üò° fix this please !!!!
I think it‚Äôs stupid to have a separate app for messages on Facebook. No one else does it. I‚Äôm hate being on Facebook and seeing that i have a message in the top right corner and opening a completely different app. It‚Äôll be easier for everyone is messages weren‚Äôt separate; like it used to be.
I have no clue why I‚Äôm locked out I have not done any thing to get locked out my phone was hacked
This application should have a log off button so that the app does not disturb you while sleeping.
so I dont have to delete the app after every use
Messenger developers think they are the CIA and FBI.... I"ve read @ least 75 reviews for an hour... NOT one said anything about how Messenger documents and looks over EVERY word you type.. AND can even listen in on people EVEN WHEN YOUR NOT USING IT.... @ least the Govt. has to get a warrant before being nosey!! People are complaining about notifications,volume problems,cant delete, requests... ITS called tapping your phone!!!! Thats the whole point!!!!!
I‚Äôm sure there was a reason the old messenger system wasn‚Äôt working (besides the fact that it was just fine) but now I have a red notification that won‚Äôt go away because I refuse to allow Facebook to send me notifications about new messages. Seriously Facebook. You‚Äôre FACEBOOK. I‚Äôm already on the app, I don‚Äôt need your stupid notifications.
In iPhone also
I would give it negative stars if possible. There are so many problems I don‚Äôt have time to list them all, I‚Äôll just say don‚Äôt give in to the pressure they put on you via FB and install it. It‚Äôs a horrible and annoying app.
But on the effects you have like 5 rows that are all the same effects and if your gonna have that many rows make all the effects different not the same. The just keep repeating themselves. Thanks  happy new year.
I really hate it because I don‚Äôt want it to be honest but Fb forces you to use it because without it you can‚Äôt see your messages which is pretty trash so now I have 2 apps just to do what the 1st app use to do ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
so annoying having to use a second app
You honestly think I want everyone in my FB friends to be able to message me at anytime? My ‚Äúreal‚Äù friends have my phone number. And we text that way.  I hate having to download this app when my mom sends/forwards me a message/pic she found and then uninstall it right after. (Btw she has my number, just not very tech savvy. Lol.) Just get rid of messaging all together.
This app is entirely too invasive.
My #1 issue is this app does not have password protection to hide your converstions from nosy eyes! whom may be able to get on your phone if you fall asleep and is curious of your people you are entertaining. please update the app with this capibiity.
Delete unwanted messages  Fix it 
FB messenger stories is 100% useless and needs to be rolled back. The app has felt bloated for a while now, and copying Snapchat is not helping create a better user experience for anyone.
Can‚Äôt send pictures, share things from FB to a group. It doesn‚Äôt work.
Facebook is pretty gay in general but this does it for me
I should not have to download two apps for the function of one site. It should be optional. This app is just a way for them to make money. I do not prefer checking my messages on messenger id rather just check them like it was before. I cannot help but look at my messages as they may be important and something I must respond to because i have family who messages me through this site. Please make it optional
Messenger was still sending me messages using my data plan when data is turned off!  I have an iPhone. Going to delete this app until the issue is resolved.
This current version keeps telling me it needs to reconnect even though my internet is fine. It‚Äôs very frustrating. It happens wherever I am: at home, work, out in the community, and all while my internet is working. I test out other apps and they work. Please fix this.
Nice to have for messages on FB but the notification sound scares my little dog so had to delete it, every time it updates sounds automatically go back to on, please fix this.
Do you guys realize that if you put your phone on do not disturb, then someone calls you through messenger, it RINGS ANYWAYS? God I can‚Äôt count the number of times I keep waking up from this stupid crap. About to delete it and it‚Äôs a primary form of communication for me and a lot of friends.
I don‚Äôt know why my friends are getting a message saying that it‚Äôs not possible to contact me (like they were blocked) only on the app. On the website it works ok they said. This is going on for months already. Fix that!!
The fact that you have to download a separate app just do message across fb is way more complicated than necessary. Build one app
Please turn off the ‚Äúinvite‚Äù button when someone already has the app. I‚Äôve had this for a long time and I hate continuing to get invitations that clog up my latest messages. Also, I wish there was a way to group the messages. I belong to a collectors group and I would love to put all of these people together away from regular messages. Thank you.
For those who have long message threads going through the messsages to find something is a hassle. So the inclusion of a jump to date or view dates from when you messaged someone is a must and will be greatly appreciated.
Please put it back to the way it was.  So much spam coming through and no way to just delete without clicking or get it off your alerts without clicking it.  Uninstalling.
My story couldn‚Äôt appear 4 every 1
Facebook Messenger app was a great app a couple of years ago. But now with ADS, My Story and all these games, it has turned into a slow, ugly and an app thats not even a simple Messenger. Please Facebook don‚Äôt ruin the experience , Viber and Whatsapp are such a great alternative, simple and clean.
I really hate Facebook and their apps. But alas I‚Äôm forced to use them. Thin one in particular though caught my wrath. I noticed my brand new iPhone 8 battery dying faster than it should. I check it out and messenger who was only 10 min on screen had been running for 45 min in the background consuming 40% of my battery! I checked and according to my settings it‚Äôs not allowed to background app refresh. I‚Äôm not sure what loophole they are using to continue running in the background. But turning off notifications seemed to help, though that defeats the purpose of this app.
Please make a fix to choose the sound alert for calls and message alerts!!! The one sound drives dogs crazy and it too quiet to actually hear!!!!!
It was perfectly fine a few weeks ago but now it keeps freezing and I have to relaunch the app multiple times a day. It also freezes every couple of minutes during a conversation. This is unacceptable. Fix this asap please.  Also, the new phone and sms features are bloatware and made me despise this app. It constantly asks me to use my number and zi don‚Äôt want to because I don‚Äôt want non facebook friends to find me on messenger with my number. I also don‚Äôt like strangers being able to add me! I get enough of that on facebook as it is.   I only still use this stupid app because my parents don‚Äôt know how to use other messaging apps, which is odd since it has become unnecessarily complicated by the addition of these features.   The games and bot features are nice though and I can see their usefulness but the rest of the newer features are crap. 
dislike the fact that you are unable to discard a message without viewing it. a fix is past due.  phone/call quality is still üëéüèæ
Because I don‚Äôt want it on my phone. I keep refusing permission for this app to upload my contacts‚Ä¶ But it does anyway. My contacts are not Facebook‚Äòs information too... total violation of privacy. And to top it off! Half my contacts aren‚Äôt even my contacts‚Ä¶ I have shared contacts. And contacts of somebody I do a little donated work for. (She‚Äôs blind! I have to send texts and make some call for her.) Why should I be sharing other people‚Äôs contacts with Facebook? Not cool at all. I hate this app! I don‚Äôt use the Facebook app. I logon online. But no‚Ä¶ No you can‚Äôt get your messages unless you have this freaking app on your phone! People need to learn to freaking call or text!
I‚Äôm SHOCKED this app has anything over one star out of five.  I rarely use Facebook anymore, so to have to keep an app for those occasional messages I get is quite a nuisance, to say the very least. Not even having the option to view/respond to messages on Facebook itself is insane - NOBODY asked for a separate messaging app, and NOBODY likes that we are forced to use one now! Facebook has been dying out a bit, yes, but THIS will not save it. Make things EASIER, not more complicated.  Don‚Äôt download this app. It is a waste of time and storage. 
Constant updating is unnecessary as it doesn't address the aggravating things about this app. There is NO reason to begin a "conversation" with someone that you've just friended on FB. IF I wanted to initiate a message with that person then I'm perfectly capable of doing so on my own. All this app has done is create an aggravation. Knock it off.  Actually read your reviews and improve it based on the feedback given.  Fix it so WE can choose to opt out of this sort of thing.
Why can we still not change the notification sound its almost 2018....come on
My voice memo always glitches and doesn‚Äôt send, or cuts me off in 9 second intervals!!! Cant find a fix :(((
This just happened I tried sending a video to my friend but it said unable to play video like this is the first time it happened please fix it
Facebook messenger on Apple watch needs to be fixed iv tried everything and still wont work my watch is brand new just got it yesterday and everything is up to date
The 3D Touch feature is completely broken. Please fix this issue or remove it. It‚Äôs infuriating.
The whole point of blocking people is so that they don‚Äôt contact you, and you don‚Äôt contact them. Whoever thought it was a good idea to now show profile pictures next to the names on your blocked list, is beyond evil. People I‚Äôm not even friends on fb or the messenger are coming up on my ‚Äúactive‚Äù people list and I can‚Äôt clear my search history, that again, shows people I now have blocked. If you want Facebook to be a ‚Äúbull free‚Äù and ‚Äúdrama free‚Äù app, maybe it would be a good start not to have stuff like that happen. Thanks.
great app just the best, keep up the good work.
Since the 147.0 update, messenger will no longer open on my iPhone & any of my iPads. When is the next fix?
The app is fine. My objection is being forced to use a separate application
I never write reviews, but I am tired of the same problem when I receive phone calls on Messenger. I have an iPhone so a notification pops up when I have an incoming call. I click on it to answer, but the screen turns blank! I cannot answer or hang up a call. It does this EVERY SINGLE TIME! I have to close the app and open it up again, but the call does not show up so I have to call the person who had initially called ME. Please fix this! I am so, very annoyed!!!
My microphone doesn‚Äôt work on video chat and I have tried everything
I am fearful of opening some messages that might not be from the actual sender. I wish that I could delete a message without opening it.
Please re-add the sound effect during calls. Also can we get a cache delete button?
Would be great to have a spot where archived messages are put. And search bar to search the archived messages.
The only way to restrict people from sending you ‚ÄúPrivate Messages‚Äù asking you to share them with all of your friends (Make them PUBLIC) is to unfriend or block the offenders.  Facebook should give us the option to use the app, and also the option to choose with whom we share Private Messages. Without those options, I find the app frustrating and annoying. 
Tries to sneakily upload all my contact address book info, complete with a flashing arrow.  Have to jump thru screens to stop it.  Viewing messages forces users to install yet another messaging app that duplicates functions which already exist.
Hate the fact that it MUST be downloaded to view messages from mobile üò°  Edit: HOW TF IS THIS AGED 4+ !? 
I‚Äôd like more opportunities to turn off bloated features in Messenger. I have no choice but to use the app to talk to some loved ones and friends‚Äîand the new active notifications that block the clock and battery percentage are incredibly distracting. I‚Äôd like a way to turn off that new feature. I‚Äôd also like a way to pause gifs, if that‚Äôs even possible (shouldn‚Äôt there be a way to implement that?)   If any developers are reading this, thanks for taking the time. 
Ahora crean otra aplicaci√≥n solo para ver mensajes de Facebook, aparte a prop√≥sito deshabilitan Messenger cuando no se lo ha actualizado
No teardrop for filters on video call
You need to make it easier to delete messages... I have hundreds and I spent an hour deleting a bunch!
It appears I'm receiving posts meant to be on public Facebook? in this, it may be new users not understanding or something changed, it is also very difficult to clear alerts! I have hated this app from day one! I only allow it on one of my 4 devices and have deleted from that device at times. I doubt FB even reads these or cares about all the negative, it just gets worse.
Could stop wanting us to rate the app after ever call we take
Seems very easy to hack. Friends get messages that look like they r from me but are not. My settings are just friends
It always displays no internet connection when I switch from WiFi to cellular. While I can use safari for web without any issues
why does it take up 1GB of my storage? it only used to be like 500MB
Please add Siri support and enable encryption by default!!  Looking at the reviews here is time to look for a new messaging client... 
Dropped calls doesn‚Äôt show if any one watched my story always crashing
The option to setup via phone without FB is horrible. I have deleted and reinstalled this app several times because the verification code thats suppose to be sent via text never comes through
What the hell . Loading loading and loading.
Fix this app so I don‚Äôt accidentally send invites in GIFs!
My messenger call is bad. I can‚Äôt talk to my friend. Please do something. 
I‚Äôm tired of hitting the emoticon button on the Right when I‚Äôm trying to finish a sentence. I just hit my phone because I‚Äôm so sick of it.
The new update is worst about the edits picture I can‚Äôt add any picture in it. This messenger become worst and worst (I should stop using this app)
Please give us the option to shut off the minute time next to the photos and the scrolling live icon on the top.  It‚Äôs very apparent you are trying to manipulate our behavior to increase use. Considering deleting the app because of this.
Horrible, useless app that should not exist. Constantly annoying in every way. Would not recommend. Forced adoption for Facebook only compounds the deep, deep failure of this app to contribute anything of value to the lives of its users.
Can't archive my messages. After clicking it does nothing.
^^
Stop asking me if I want to turn on notifications every time I use this stupid app. Didn‚Äôt iOS 11 put in restrictions to apps to prevent these excessive notifications?? **pulls hair out and/or deletes app**
Can anyone help me I need to know why I can‚Äôt open this app so I downloaded it and it worked then I updated it and it didn‚Äôt work? So now when I download it, it just won‚Äôt let me open it? Please help
It is unbelievably frustrating, having to switch apps just to read or send a Facebook message. Not only that, but having to download a whole other app, wasting space on my phone. It‚Äôs completely unnecessary.
Terrible functionality terrible call quality terrible UI. Takes *****ing 10 steps to delete a conversation. **** you Facebook
If you're going to force me to use messenger at least make an app it doesn't freeze up every week. I also don't like being forced to receive notifications. Sure you can choose to opt out but then you will be asked every single time you log onto Facebook messenger until you finally give up and say OK
Messenger has been lagging a lot lately ,it needs to be reviewed over by someone who can fix because these new updates aren‚Äôt helping they are just making messenger so much worse . It shows that a person is active when they really aren‚Äôt . Messenger signs me out a lot . Also you guys need to bring back the old emojis
Why doesn‚Äôt this app have an option to log out? This app is pretty much like leaving the back door open to your house all the time. I don‚Äôt like this app for that fact.
No complaints
Stupid how you have to use messenger to look at Facebook messages to me
Sometimes more than not, when I send a message, the other person goes says without seeing it and I have even checked with them and they say the don‚Äôt get a notification about it. It just goes to a small circle with a delivered checkmark by it but not the big circle where they have read it. This always seems to happen a lot even when in a full blown conversation with someone it just stops cause they don‚Äôt get the message. Or especially when trying to message someone about something on the market place. It‚Äôs really annoying, hopefully you guys know about it and can fix it. Thank you
Only this app keeps crashing no matter how many times I uninstall and reinstall. POS FB App. Oh and it did the same on my iPhone 6S Plus
I HATE that I can‚Äôt use Facebook messaging without the messenger app. It is cluttered, annoying and a complete waste of space on my phone to have an additional useless app.  This app is like an annoying 2 year old asking ‚Äòare we there yet?‚Äô when it asks ‚Äòdo you want notifications?‚Äô. It shows notifications to make you turn on notifications.  I literally download it to look at a message and then uninstall after I‚Äôve replied.   Makes me like Facebook even less. 
Messenger drops calls whenever u talk to ur boyfriend/girlfriend so be warned their probably hearing our phone calls #RelationshipGang
Can not stand all the chain messages and buggy links. So ridiculous. Now all the marketing and emails showing in contacts. Spent hours going through and deleting them. Don‚Äôt do business with them and don‚Äôt need them appearing-especially when I‚Äôve no allowed access to contacts through Facebook, messenger, or email apps to have access. What a nosey world we live in. Also, when I set messenger to inactive why to you have to alert everyone that I still am and what time? You have secret messages why not secret activity?
Stop the ever present nagging about allowing notifications. If a user declines, then the app should respect that. Frustratingly bad UX decision.
PLEASE MAKE MESSANGER LOG OUT IM TIRED OF THAT NOT HAPPENING LIKE CAN YU HUST HAVE A SIGN OUT ANS SIGN IN BUTTON . SHEEESH??!?!??!!
Why my messenger sound don‚Äôt work they can‚Äôt hear me but I can hear them
I Hate Messenger 100,000% more than mosquitos.
It would be one thing if the app was optional for viewing messages, but the fact that I'm now forced to download an app just to open messages is so asinine that I felt compelled to give this abomination of an app one star.  Furthermore, EVERY time I open the app, even when it‚Äôs already running, it bugs me to enable notifications. Why is ‚Äúno‚Äù not an acceptable answer? How many times do I need to say this before the app takes me seriously?  It‚Äôs installed temporarily due to a friend‚Äôs phone malfunctioning but I can‚Äôt wait to be rid of it again. 
So dumb
I‚Äôm never able to send a full voice note cause it just stops all of the sudden like around 9-12 seconds then send its self  Also on video calls, can‚Äôt rotate the phone cause it bugs out. Like the camera will go sideways and the one that I see my self in stays normal. Won‚Äôt rotate. Causing the calls to be more laggy. 
This app is so trash now
Ter que baixar um app pra ler as mensagens √© horr√≠vel, n√£o √© justo com os usu√°rios do Facebook. N√£o quero ter dois apps para poder enviar mensagens!
There are some things that I would love to see again. Which would be the option to show if you are online or not within the app. I miss the option for choosing to be offline for however long you want too, even if you are talking to a select few that you want too, it will keep you offline until you decide to be back online again.
Trying to use the app to even get to the messages and it‚Äôs stuck on a screen and won‚Äôt let me select an option to move on
Why complicate things and have us download another app just to send messages? What was wrong with the instant messaging on FB. Hate that I have to have another app. It‚Äôs easier and faster just to post something on the persons wall.
And now we can't copy links or open them outside the messenger app üëé I'd delete this app but my mother still sends me Facebook messages
Just awful. Very long start times, crashes, buggy interface.
Facebook knowingly accepted money from Russia - that‚Äôs treason in my book!
I read the other coment. And the volume is a big big problem.... but also o want to have the chance to erase people I don‚Äôt want anymore in my group of friends. Simple because they never answer any of my texts. ...And one thing more;...  somebody is using us when I recibe a video and olso ask me to resent to the sender. I never ever send one thing to anyone. And ask him to send my text back.
It‚Äôs not one of my favorite phones it‚Äôs just not I want my Samsung back üò´üò©üò§
First Facebook tries to hijack all of the information on my phone then when I figure out how to keep them from doing this they try to force me to down load messenger so they again can have access to all of my contacts so they can send them unsolicited invitations in my name.  It will not let me completely install and use unless I give it free access to all of my PRIVATE information. When it insisted on accessing my information I offloaded it from my phone. GOOD RIDDANCE!
I use this app to have conversations with my family and friends and I like it, but now with the adds in the middle of your conversations is very annoying, is not enough all the adds that we see on facebook?  give us a little bit of privacy!!!! Hate this totally !!! at this point im going to start looking for an other application that doesn‚Äôt have all this advertisements !!!
Hey guys, I want to check my messages via my phone online without this app. Could you bring this possibility back? I‚Äôd be glad to remove this low rating. Thank you.
Got a watch can‚Äôt use this app at all
When I try to use this app on the Apple Watch, it just shows a loading icon/screen or a blank screen. This needs to be fixed!!
No one needs the notification ‚Äúyou are now connected on Messenger‚Äù when they get a new friend. It is so dumb and a time waster.
No a bad app when it works
A cpl days after the update the app has been loading and moving slowly. Sometimes freezing. Closing it out or re starting my phone doesn‚Äôt improve the performance. Today i decided to delete and re-download still same issue.
Theres a notification that shown in my app that says you need to update your app because may messenger is out of the date., and then when i try to update it,it didnt work until i cannot open the app. i have no choice so i decided to delete it, and now i try to redownload it,but the caution ‚Äúyou cant download the app at this times‚Äù always shown in app store., si please fix it.,
I hate that you HAVE TO have your notifications on or else the little red notification icon will always be up
You‚Äôd think the app should know if I have the most recent version.  App Store says I do.  But your app won‚Äôt work right and keeps telling me to update.  Fail.
Mine and my dads money sending or request keeps saying payment unavailable... it only does it on his name on all the others it works other than that the app is fine
I‚Äôm quite certain something can be done about it, I‚Äôm not sure how to go about it? Not very tech smart. Basics but not as far along as most tech geeks. But I‚Äôm sure someone might have tips on how to fix this.
Neosaginist stated exactly how I feel and what I wanted to say about this app. It does what it is supposed to, but the constant opting-out that you have to do to for the push notifications is terrible.  I only download this app to talk to people whom I have no other contact with, but then end up deleting it because it's the worst. It's silly that messages can't be read through the mobile site and a seperate app is necessary. 
A split screen or multitasking feature while using other apps would be fantastic  :)
Didn‚Äôt use to have to and don‚Äôt see the point. So I‚Äôd give it zero stars if I could.
dittttttooooo
Updates regularly and doesn‚Äôt tell you what‚Äôs being updated. Don‚Äôt want a mystery app adding stuff, taking up App Store reviewer‚Äôs time and our bandwidth, and having useless release notes. Deleted. Use Signal, Threema, or (best) IPhone Messages app instead.
Has there been an update yet that didn‚Äôt make things worse    Why don‚Äôt these tech weenies sit on there hands or go learn a real skill before trying to crate  ‚Äúupdates‚Äùthat ‚Äúimprove‚Äù   You kids don‚Äôt know sh*t 
I don‚Äôt want any notifications. I‚Äôve deliberately set it this way, but the app badge keeps telling me I have a message. And the message: it‚Äôs from the app telling me to turn on notifications! Even when I allow notifications, it tells me to turn them on. It apparently is only happy if I allow banners or sounds, not just badge icons.
My screen is so small. Why can‚Äôt it be adjusted to make it larger?
WiFi or no WiFi I cannot connect. Says there is an internet problem. Wish that‚Äôd get fixed
It‚Äôs good, one thing that annoys me is that profile pics never update. It‚Äôs a minor thing but it sure is annoying
There are rumors floating around that your account will not be safe... predators or even FB will grab your contact information. Why do I have to have the messenger app to communicate privately with certain contacts. I only install it when I see someone I know has sent me a message. 
I don‚Äôt want store fb messanger call history in my mobile. Better keep history own app.
This app is great for me to get in touch with friends that have Facebook. I just have trouble viewing My Day stories.
I agree that not being able to control the volume is a real problem!  Apple:  FIX IT!!!!!
If there is a way to delete people off of the contacts list in this app please let me know.  Somehow there are people I haven‚Äôt added.             Thank You 
This should be baked into the Facebook app. Not separate.
They insist you use this if you want to check your messages on your cell phone. The definition of a corporate Dictatorship.
I used to be totally addicted, but now I can honestly say that I hate you Facebook. In fact, I literally only ever re-download either of your apps for 10-15 (minutes at a time) when some ignorant a$$h0le I know in real life refuses to email me or send event invite info separate from your horrible, suicide inducing app.   That‚Äôs kind of it. I hate everything FB, ESPECIALLY the ‚Äúneed‚Äù for TWO f^<*!ng apps. I hate you I hate you I hate you times fifty billion.   Merry Xmas, dickholes. 
I don‚Äôt know if it is my phone or not, but messenger takes forever to start up. Each time i go into different account or just opening the app, it takes like 10min for everything to come up using and when it‚Äôs good as it should be after chatting from a conversation, when clicking the back button it does the same thing but at least 1-2min waiting this time. Need help. I don‚Äôt know if this is a bug or not or if it my phone, but i restarted my phone even uninstall the app but it still did the same.
This is ridiculous! It‚Äôs been over a week that I‚Äôve tried opening the app only for it to load (not showing anything), crash, and close on me! I‚Äôve uninstalled and installed the app multiple times, but that still doesn‚Äôt fix the problem! FIX THE APP!
Please fix messenger for the Apple Watch! I looked it up and it seems to be an issue for many people. Nothing has fixed it. Thank you!
Junk mail, physical and electronic Telemarketers, especially overseas who pretend to reside in your hometown Highway billboards FB Feeds about someone else's lunch Car dealership decals, emblems, stickers, and badges on your new car IE on Windows OS, Safari on Mac OS "Really bro" as an expression of incredulity from a stranger, especially those who are exercising their capacity as a government agent I feel molested every time I see notification in the FB app that I have received a message via FB Messenger Dear reader, If there is anything in this world that deserves to be called by whatever name it is you think is the worst name anyone can be called, it‚Äòs everyone involved in creating and distributing Facebook Messenger. 
Love it
This app has too many bugs, it will randomly close while I‚Äôm typing, when someone calls me or I call them we can‚Äôt hear each other. Never had issues before but in the past couple months this app has gone way down hill. Very disappointed.
The only reason I use this because I‚Äôm stuck in a group chat. Whenever I mute a conversation for a short period of time, it often forgets that I did that and will just play notifications anyway. Also I can never catch up because, instead of taking me to the last message I read, it takes me to the newest message and marks it as read. Whenever I‚Äôm chatting with other person and I have the group chat unread and I leave the app, it takes me right to the unread message instead of the main menu. There‚Äôs a few various dumb things that are completely unnecessary: like a displaying a full 5 second animation after reacting to another message. Why would anyone ever need that? Not being able to change the notification sound is also kind of a pain. This app is the reason I keep my phone on mute. And the FB team is only going to make this app worse. If you can, avoid this app.
For some reason messenger keeps connecting and disconnecting from my WiFi and data. I know both are working fine because every other application on my phone isn‚Äôt giving me problems. Please fix this ASAP, also fix the volume issue and make it changeable on video call.
Either I'm stupid or this effing app doesnt have a logout button
Issues when typing and display is off when typing. Keyboard taps out when just before completion of text. Often manually reset phone just for the keyboard. Sad. So judiciously sad.
Don‚Äôt want another full-fledged IM as I have plenty and don‚Äôt want one stop dingle mega vendor.  Especially given most my friends don‚Äôt even use Messenger, even if they use FB.
Terrible app.. it could be great. At least have a way to turn it off and no notfcaton while off 
Love the app always have but i think there may be a bug with replying through the notification center on iphone like its been a few times where the message would come down from the top i pull down type my reply hit send but later i check and it never got sent
Will you guys just add a feature that blocks all calls and messages?
I‚Äôve deleted, updated and re added the app and the video chat still does not work. Now I‚Äôm having issues with being able to send pictures. How can I fix this? 
....
Messenger is horrible and it gives people permission to be looking through your cameras at it in time without you even knowing
Watch app needs to sync messages from the phone much faster. Sometimes I dont receive messages from watch until 5 minutes after my phone receives them
Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the app or if it‚Äôs just the game itself. Been trying to watch videos for a week now and it keeps giving me this screan. By the way the game is everwing
There is nothing wrong with this messenger
The app was great until the games stopped loading.  Now I keep getting the message: "The game was not able to load due to an unexpected issue."
Stop denying access to messages in the Facebook app
This is garbage. If you want to edit an early part of the message you‚Äôll be typing blindly while it auto scrolls to lead you staring at the end of your message. But I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm writing this as there‚Äôs not really alternatives.
Now Messanger shows you the last time that person was online, by the minute.... not cool. üëé Breach of privacy
Great game play it all the time
I use messenger to call my Family back home cause I am stationed in Japan. I‚Äôm sick and tired of none of my calls going through and not being able to talk to them. It‚Äôs Christmas morning and I‚Äôm trying to talk to my family and the calls just keep dropping. This keeps happening with that past 2 or 3 versions of messenger. Any help please would be appreciated!!
Always sub par quality, unexplainable static, low volume, everything bad about calls happening every week
Messenger filters worked great until I upgraded to iOS 11. After iOS 11 upgrade when you try to use the filters the app constantly crashes. Messenger also slows down to a crawl. The app is practically useless. Facebook or Apple needs to fix the issue
Wish there was a way turn messenger off an on so messages can or can not be sent unless the user turn it on or off.
First off: how many F'ing times do you idiots need me to tell you I DON'T WANT NOTIFICATIONS ON?!?!?!  EVERY TIME log on, it pops up to "remind me" .... even when in mid-text!!!  Also - turns everything upside down when I click to close background programs.  AND: MAKE IT EASIER TO LOG OFF!!!!! 
C
Les publicit√©s ne sont pas mes amis et n‚Äôont rien √† faire ici. A retirer rapidement svp
Why haven‚Äôt they come up for a way to log out of this??
I‚Äôve had Messenger downloaded for years and never once has it told my friends that I‚Äôm on Messenger, so I occasionally get invited to join Messenger even though I already have it. This bug has been around for years and it‚Äôs never been fixed, it‚Äôs high time you get around to that.
THE OPTION TO STAY OFFLINE AND/OR INVISIBLE IS DISABLED. NOW, IT ALWAYS STAY GREEN OR AVAILABLE! STUPID!!!
If only it was more compact in size. The story feature is totally useless, i‚Äôm using this app to message and call my friends. If i wanted to see their story updates, I‚Äôd use Facebook or, even better, snapchat.
This application has gotten worse and worse and worse there‚Äôs just no other way to say it without being disrespectful and cursing but this application used to be very good now it‚Äôs stinks everything freezes you can open up your messages you get a blank page if it finally opens you can‚Äôt respond it‚Äôs stinks and Facebook what are they do nothing they stink to giving serious contemplation to deleting all of this and removing myself from Facebook because it‚Äôs stinks Mark Zuckerberg really needs to sit down and reevaluate what he‚Äôs doing to and for Facebook and it‚Äôs followers
How do you update an app by taking away features? Seems like a down-date to me üò° I would like to be able to type on photos sent please and thank you!
My messenger is acting uuupppo
What is the point of this app? Why can‚Äôt they just add the texting feature into Facebook like literally every other SM app?
BY DUANE SERGENT FROM ROGERSVILLE, TENNESSEE. IS THERE ANY WAY TO STOP IT?
Once you download the Facebook application, you then in turn have to download another application to use the message feature that should be accessible from the first application.
poor user interface. not intuitive and THE WORST PART you CANT DELETE MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS... you literally have to delete each individual conversation... who the heck has that time. super annoying and inconvenient. going to delete the app from my phone. sad.
There is no way to log out
Every time I open the app, it logs me out and asks if I want to add my phone number, it is becoming frustrating when I want to quickly reply back.
Last update thing just crashes for no reason.
The app freezes and crashes whenever I send a gif, and sometimes randomly as well. It‚Äôs getting really frustrating so please fix!
Hey Facebook, I don‚Äôt want Notifications on!  Got it?!  Stop the annoying pop ups asking me to turn on notifications.  App deleted.
It‚Äôs junk it‚Äôs been junk and you keep making it worse
Until all the viruses and filth that transfers through messenger is comfortably fixed I won‚Äôt be using it. You can‚Äôt ever tell for sure if it‚Äôs safe to open something or not.
I want be able to LOG OUT of this APP, FIX THIS - please.
So either my number or the messenger app is having trouble confirming my phone number to establish the app in my Facebook account. I tried to constantly change my number but the app still won‚Äôt send a confirmation code. Please help ive already downloaded it multiple times.
I think messenger is horrible
My messenger is taking forever to load my conversations please fix
Too many steps to get to the message!
Good
Either the app freezes or can‚Äôt review pictures you sent without deleting and reinstalling app.
Why do I need another messenger app when the Facebook app has Messenger? Then I get an invitation on the Facebook app to sign on to the Messenger app. WTH?  I already have it. But why does it not just open it?  Uggh. Get yo stuff straight

Can‚Äôt delete some messages. The delete option doesn‚Äôt come up when pressing on the message to be deleted. Frustrated. I deleted the whole app.
It doesn‚Äôt make no notification noise at all
They have complete access to your entire phone and cameras
iPhone has no chat bubbles?!?!!!!  NOT COOL 
I really like that I can chat with family and friends on messenger. What I do not like is that anyone can grab my name off FB and send me a message like they are a friend. It is creepy and wrong. If it keeps up I am going to just go off FB.
I want to get my messages on FB. Do not want app!!!
Every time  open this app it take forever to load. It‚Äôs so annoying it‚Äôs been goin on too long it needs to be fixed
Curses be upon you for blocking me from using messenger because of something I posted on Facebook. You guys are A$$holes, I can‚Äôt even contact my family now. I hope you have a disastrous holiday FB Messenger team. üñïüèª
We use this primarily for the end to end encryption. However, lately it's been not delivering notifications when you are out of the app. Messenger has stickers and a better conversational layout than Signal. All useless, if you don't even receive the message! Those interested in privacy should use Signal. It's a bit spartan, but it works.  Long term gripes.  * Ads  * Large fortnightly update, that doesn't seem to fix anything or let you know what they're doing. * Features for children that are bloat. * Reliability isn't there. Not sure if the less secure channel is more reliable than the above. 
The incoming message from someone else moves my screen when I've scrolled up and it would let me read my message. It's "seizure enducing" trying to read it.
The ONLY reason I downloaded this app was so I could see my PMs from my phone. There appears to be no way to view your "Other" messages folder, making this worthless for my purposes.  Also stop asking me if I want to turn on Notifications. I. DO. NOT. CARE. 
Even while I‚Äôm connected to WiFi I never get notified when I get messages from people. Messages take forever to send even on fast internet and when the finally send the person on the other end hardly ever receive the message.
Make it easier to delete conversations on Facebook Messenger.
Conversations won't load, stuck on loading screen for a full 10 minutes trying to reply to a message.  Also I still want to be able to change the notification sound. 
Since the last update I am unable to use the app. I can open but after that it freezes. I've deleted and reinstalled and still the same.
Smart invert is reversing the color of the images too!  But shouldn‚Äôt reverse the color of the images. It‚Äôs behaving like classic invert. I don‚Äôt see this issue in WhatsApp - smart invert is working as expected and displays the images as is. Thank you!
I despise the fact that Facebook makes you download this app just to send a message. How stupid.
You can‚Äôt write the letter ‚Äúi‚Äù, Instead it uses ‚ÄúIÔ∏è ‚Äú. Major bug that literally is ruining alll my conversations because do you know how hard it is to write a sentence without using the letter ‚ÄúI‚Äù? It‚Äôs been like this for a while and no one seems to be fixing it. It‚Äôs Ok, faceboook is a waste of time anyways. So dumb!
Constantly getting signed out ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It‚Äôs really obnoxious that you need this app to just see your Facebook messages
Using messenger is a fantastic way to communicate with my friends.  However, lately when I click to view an attached picture or video the app freezes and I can‚Äôt leave the conversation.  The only thing I can do is delete the app and reinstall.  I‚Äôve already done this 4 times this week.
So I can only see my older messages part of the time and that‚Äôs when I use the link through the FB app.  And I can only see them when there‚Äôs a new message.  Some new messages go into messenger‚Äôs updated app, while others go to where my older messages are.  Idk, doesn‚Äôt make sense and aggravating as hell.
Update: Had to take it down to one star because they literally spam you every time you open the app to ‚Äúturn on notifications.‚Äù It is the most obnoxious thing of all time.  So desperate to integrate our lives further into their system, Facebook has created a separate app with a constant barrage of notifications that beg you to give them all of your contacts.  Why could this have not been integrated into the main Facebook app? I hate that we have to download more bloatwear on our phones to get simple tasks done like send a simple message.  I had to give the app two stars instead of one because it‚Äôs cool that I can message my sister back-and-forth who lives in Singapore, which obviously could lead to charges if both parties don‚Äôt use iMessage accounts or don‚Äôt want to send emails all the time. 
Crashes every minute!! Not getting notifications. Have to physically open the app to get messages, also sporadically getting notifications and then once I open the app there is nothing there from that person.
I can hear you now. I‚Äôve only heard this phone once, and the folks who sold me this said it won‚Äôt go any loude! Oh, well...
Turns out I haven‚Äôt been getting a group FB message since all the way to June on the app! They are all FB friends, yet the only way I could get to them (which I just discovered today) was digging deep on the computer and there are 266 messages that I missed, some of them were super important. I go to try and find them in the app and nothing will show up. I am super annoyed! This needs to be fixed!
Okay its okay
My messenger was working fine until recently, I can‚Äôt see if anybody has read my message or even if I was delivered! Usually I would see the bubble when you go on messenger if somebody viewed your message their picture would be there or if your message sent it would be the blue check mark now I can‚Äôt see that unless I go on the message itself which is annoying. All I see is the time it was sent. I have my boyfriends account logged on to the messenger as well and his doesn‚Äôt do that just mine???? It‚Äôs annoying fix it!!!
I only downloaded this to get rid of my notifications since you cant see messages in the Facebook app
I was told I could use the messenger without WiFi... it should work automatically. Well my messenger never has worked unless I‚Äôm connected to WiFi. I have deleted the app and added it back several times and it still only works when I‚Äôm connected to WiFi. I have an iPhone 7 Plus.
I love this app, for me work perfect but please add support to smart inverted color to pictures please  and Thanks
When you go to delete a conversation and it pops up delete or archive it should say the persons name that you are doing it to. I have deleted the wrong person many of times thinking I was deleting the person above or below them.
I kept getting hacked on messenger so I had to delete it.
Why can‚Äôt I power down my screen? Every time I‚Äôm in a call on messenger and then I proceed to power down my screen, the call now drops. Wasn‚Äôt like this before. It seems like every update just get worse and worse for iPhone. I‚Äôm using 2 different iPhones and both experience the same problems. iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus. I noticed that the call answer button is no longer green but blue. It‚Äôs not always blue. Sometimes it will still show up green. But when the button to answer the call is blue, the call gets messed up. If it‚Äôs green, I can answer the call normally. Until this is fixed, I will start to use a different app to make calls...
Difficult to organized, nosing too much .
I‚Äôm making my peace with ads on regular FB, but now we got ads on Messenger as if we aren‚Äôt spammed enough. I‚Äôm seriously considering finding a new social media platform because greed is ruining this one.
By Downloading this app you‚Äôre allowing Facebook to look through ANYTHING on your phone; calls, texts, etc..you are even giving them permission to use your camera and voice recording ANYTIME they want without your permission!!!! Don‚Äôt download this app!
Should be able to see thin browser I hate FB apps. BS!
I shouldn‚Äôt need another app for this
I don‚Äôt want to use an app to view my messages!! let‚Äôs go back to the old way of viewing
The last few updates have ruined my notifications, and the latest update wiped all of my secret conversations because it treated my phone as an entirely new device. Switching back to WhatsApp.
I wish you guys to putting more MB and it is taking up too much storage and I have to get rid of all the other apps I like to use often
Okay so I have a connection that I don‚Äôt have as a friend, but for some reason it won‚Äôt let me have them view my story. I only have some friends and that one connection(I don‚Äôt have them as a friend on FB) viewing my story and the rest were fine and eventually my connection would view my story again. It keeps doing it again by not letting me have them view my story again. Please fix this bug Messenger.
I have no link to sync my I watch to Facebook messenger can you please help me
I have to keep adding my memes back on very time it updates- what a pain!!! Don't even see any difference in the updates anyway- Also the location of my friends is gone- would like to have it back to see were my friends are located or traveling to- an from-where‚Äôs my side bar of friends??? Tired of Gittin ads from messanger as well as to my email- stop!!! 
However, it\'s super irritating with this current version, that I can\'t play messenger games with people without it looking like I have an unread message from each individual because either them or I have made a move in the game. App badges would be enough for me, within the application. Separate the games notifications from the messenge notifications please! Badges on the game tab and that\'s it would be super nice. If I want to play games I\'ll go over there. But I\'m actually losing messages in all these integrated game notifications...  Also still having an issue with messenger not allowing me to continue typing a message when the phone is rotated. The whole app freezes and I am forced to close or send a half typed message. Many times this happens and it was not intentional at all. A fix would be fantastic. Currently functioning off iOS 11.2.1 on the 7plus. 
I don‚Äôt know if it is my phone or something but when I call anyone they either can‚Äôt hear me or I can‚Äôt hear them. Also when I‚Äôm calling someone and I want to watch a video with him/her I can not hear the video at all. Please fix these issues in a following update. Other then that the app is great for me!
Nothing has been fixed. Ive been having the same problem with it for the longest, no matter how many times they claim to have fixed bugs and Ive updated it, things dont change!
Your app keeps crashing ever since the ios11 update.  I can make the call and as soon as it connects it drops the call saying call failed.  I‚Äôve reset the app, deleted and installed, updated phone software,  did a factory reset on the phone.  Fix your app please.
Won‚Äôt even download for me
This app drives me crazy with trying to edit large messages.  I message a lot of friends and the space is so small when I proof read it.  I have to scroll to the word, click it fast to the right spot and hope it edits or adds the word.  It‚Äôs driven me crazy since day one. Now it takes forever to load on my phone. Not sure what‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôve e deleted it and added it back several time to fix the glitch. It‚Äôs still slow. You see the review space is large and I can edit Anywhere I want. I‚Äôd love you to fix this on messenger. 
I'm tired of using the newer versions that are unstable and full of bugs. I really wish I could run a older version like some websites offer til the newer version is actually usable. Yes, I love messenger but the older built in Facebook messenger was so much easier... you guys should consider both. Limit message capabilities but maintain them in the new version. It's a better marketing strategy to obtain the happiest of customers.
It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous that you have to log on to the internet to multi delete messages and not do so from within the app. It is sooooo time consuming to have to delete all individually.
Buena app, pero en estos d√≠as no me sirve  no lo s√© porque ,les pondr√≠a las 5 estrellas si me funcionara mejor üëåüèªno me gusta siempre me falla ami
My app is frozen every time i open it
Provide more options for the duration of muting conversation like 10 & 12 hours.
Stop rolling out non-optional, privacy invasive features like ‚ÄúActive Now‚Äù and publicly displaying usage information like exactly how many minutes ago a user was active.  Let me be clear, people should NOT receive a notification when I open Messenger.   Features like this increase social anxiety and only serve to pressure users into using Messenger more often (even if it‚Äôs not healthy for them) 
The app is free. Why do you care if I update or not?? This thing has become nagware and it doesn't even charge.
Whenever I try to send a voice message longer than 5 seconds, the recording won‚Äôt stop, and then not send anything at all. This has been an issue since release and I‚Äôm shocked that not a single developer at Facebook could fix a glitch this simple.
No idea why you guys would take away if your message was read in app. Now I have to go into the message to see if someone has read the said message or not. This is the biggest complaint. I have noticed how picture to text is slowed down as well.
Is it really necessary to build another app just to message people? If you really needed another app to use all the other functions thats fine, but if I only want to message people then I shouldn't have to download a whole other app just to do it. It takes up space too. Please just add regular messaging in the Facebook app. Then you can leave calling and video calling and whatever is else you can do on the messenger app.
The red exclamation point won't go away, it's there to tell me to turn on notifications which I already have on....
Currently the app is cluttered so the user is bombarded with unnecessary information and has become somewhat of a pain to use to communicate.   New update is even more ridden with features and apps I don‚Äôt need and have no way to toggle them on or off, such as: - A notification display at the top of your screen when someone you frequently message is online  - Stories - It‚Äôs been appearing as disappearing on my app; ‚Äústreaks‚Äù that enumerate consecutive days you and another person have sent each other a message.   These cause my app to be less functional. I enjoy having the option to add stickers etc and personalizations like emojis in the place of the like button are nice to have. Interestingly these are two VERY customizable options in the app which make what I thought was its function - communication - easier and more enjoyable. Would be nice to see such a frequently used and developed app gain this type of modularity. 
You are advertising Mopleez ads in very poor taste in the US. My kids happen to see it every day. One of the man says on TV about his mom: ‚Äúshe does not care where I am or who I am with‚Äù with a woman dangling her legs while he is speaking so. Is this what we want to tell our kids? You are legitimizing an action that we have not legitimized for our children. The second ad says ‚ÄúWhat Brian does not know is that like I can access his emails, I can also access...‚Äù. That is a gay abusive relationship. US Indians are conservative people. I don‚Äôt understand if you are trying to attract bachelors, are these the best ads you can put forth? I plan to post the comments widely on Facebook and Twitter if these ads continue much longer.   Disgusted customer. 
Don't give permition to your phone mic, try and say any kind of product, you will find Facebook ofer you an add for that product
Delete this crap
I could say this is the most uncomfortable update yet but I‚Äôd sound too pessimistic. I can‚Äôt look at shared photos in most conversation and when I can it‚Äôs just pure luck. Additionally, it doesn‚Äôt show me whether the message has been sent or delivered.   Thanks. 
The app keeps deleting itself out of my phone and I don‚Äôt know why
I try to send photos to someone but it doesn‚Äôt let me it says that I need to check my internet but my internet is working  good  And i can‚Äôt upload photos to Facebook albums not only one  Sometimes I have to upload the photos one by one I can‚Äôt even upload the 40 photos it says we well tell you when they are ready but they never upload them please fix it I can‚Äôt send photos in messenger 
What has been wrong with the Facebook messenger app all day today? It‚Äôs not just me, it‚Äôs about 9 other friends I‚Äôve spoken with as well. It won‚Äôt send or receive any messages. It won‚Äôt even connect. There isn‚Äôt an update available. I‚Äôve updated my iPhone (my friends have android) I even deleted and re-downloaded the app. Ugh.
I can‚Äôt handle all the spying this app does.
I don't have a lot of space on my phone so even the 33 mb of this app is more than I want to waste when the Facebook app was working just fine for me. There was no reason to make it forced to download another app, except maybe a better interface or user experience. It's not substantially better, and it should be up to the user to decide if they want to use it. It should not be required for me to see messages.
Where the heck is the icon that appears when someone has seen your message? I need that thing back. It‚Äôs annoying not being able to see if someone‚Äôs seen your message or not automatically like come on I am not going to everyone‚Äôs inbox manually. Also I can‚Äôt seem to see my streaks? I thought that was a thing???
Works fine for me but I hate that Im forced to have this app in order to look at my fb messages on my phone. Is there a reason it can't just be one app..?
I don‚Äôt see the need for this company that is rolling in money to add ads to literally every aspect of the program. Before you know it there will be ads before you can send a message... sad day for Facebook trying to monetize every bit of the program. I get that we get it for free... but come on.
I haven‚Äôt really had much problems with the app other than when I call someone and if I lock my iPhone on the call it‚Äôll end the call. This didn‚Äôt use to be the case but now they changed it. Please fix it
It looks really ugly on the iPhone x. It's as if it's not designed for iPhone x. The black bars on both the top and bottom just make the app look cheap. Very bad design for such a widely used application. I'm very disappointed
On the main page where you can see all of your messages, the previous version had a gray check mark when a message was sent, and the person's profile picture if they read it. Now that's gone and replaced with the time, completely unnecessary. Having the read indicator helped me a lot when it came to running my business, it let me see at a glance who I had to follow up with
The app is great I love using messenger and my phone would be Incomplete without it but I can no longer see when people have read my messages or if the messages have been sent. I‚Äôm honestly about to delete messenger all together
Do NOT UPDATE messenger. The government can spy on you through the new update.
For some odd reason unknown people hack into my friends messenger and sent me pointless messages, hacks, and spams. This needs to be fixed. Terrible.
I just finally had the bandwidth to upgrade my app, and I'm sorry I did. I no longer have be ability to go into a person's info, scroll down and see all the photos we've shared. Why is that gone? That was so helpful, because it's a pain to have to scroll forever to go find photos.  My friend and I are photographers and we are sharing shots from our gigs all the time, and I go back and forth to look at them and comment on stuff, and now I can't do that. PLEASE bring that feature back!!! 
It does nothing but take up space. 98% of the time my messenger app doesn‚Äôt even work. But Facebook forces you to have it. Whoever designed this deserves nothing more than to lose their job. It‚Äôs completely and utterly useless
And now the app won‚Äôt even open, so if that could be fixed that‚Äôd be great.
Add birthdays please. I‚Äôm often in Messenger rather than Facebook itself, and I‚Äôd love to see friends‚Äô birthdays here so I can shoot them a message!
I get her off?
This app is a joke! They are more worried about keeping up with Instagram and Snapchat than allowing you to send messages back-and-forth with friends and family. They have absolutely no support for iPhone.
Using Messenger is akin to employing a slide rule to compute a statistical formula. It is old, clumsy, awkward and vastly outdated considering available technological capabilities. I only use it because I am forced to by facebook. If one enjoys bringing Grandma to the Junior Prom as your date this is THE app for you.
There desperately needs to be an easier way to delete whole conversations on the IPhone version, also being able to find old unread messages should be easier. There should be an unread box, like there is with email.
Messenger seems to freeze a lot and crash my iPhone X.  Also, seems like my camera is always on when I use the app. I don‚Äôt feel safe (privacy) using it. 
Just switched from android, and I really miss the chat heads. I‚Äôm not a fan of having to open up the entire chat box to message one person. Chat heads are better in my opinion, but I don‚Äôt know how everybody else feels about it
This app is a convoluted mess....it‚Äôs not even a messenger app anymore. I haven‚Äôt seen this much parasitic garbage on an app since....actually I‚Äôve never seen this much non-essential garbage tacked on to an app.
Great communication app
1 star for making it mandatory when using Facebook
I absolutely hate the Facebook requires us to use this app! It's a space hog and won't function if you don't do the updates. They are not specific about what the updates are for, but they take up a lot of room, and are probably unnecessary with my older phone. Crashes a lot on my Samsung droid, slow on my iPhone. Wish Facebook would let us message through the app the way it used to be
I received flowers from my friends in Atlanta GA and they are such a sad bouquet. I called Customer Service and they are sending a new bouquet. I feel sad about this.
Can‚Äôt delete certain chat media/call anymore.
So it doesn‚Äôt show the person‚Äôs profile picture or sticker examples...
You won‚Äôt just accept that I DO NOT WANT to allow Push Notifications! If this doesn‚Äôt stop popping up Every time I open messenger I will just stop using it!
I am no longer able to access through Facebook app. If I open messenger it gives me only some messages and the ones I send are not being d livered. I can go to the page in and check messages but they only come up if I have a new message and the messages there are not the same as when I try to access the messages through the messenger app or by going through Facebook app
It would be a lot more efficient if users were allowed to delete messages in mass rather than one by one.  I have messages as far back as 2015, but trying to delete them is almost impossible. 
Please bring back that icon that shows when someone reads your message! I dont want to have to click my chat just to see if someone read my message or not!
You now have to put ads on messenger too?
I don‚Äôt need to see the time I sent my last message to someone on the home screen! And I hate that I can‚Äôt see if someone has seen my last message from the Home screen like I could before the update.üò£
Keyboard especially. When searching for stickers the search bar will often disappear. On that note, some sort of loading animation for the stickers would be welcome.  Scrolling through messages and then returning to the keyboard will frequently break the state of the app.  Facebook, we get that you‚Äôre bringing language AI to your platform but treating us as your content generation gerbils is really frustrating when the autocorrect frequently corrects words that are actually legal words.  This app has a simple purpose: messaging. Please let us do that without being harassed. 
When having a conversation with friends it doesn‚Äôt send messages for a good 20 minutes. But not all the time, just periodically.. and it‚Äôs really annoying when you‚Äôre mid conversation!
Every time I call someone and turn my phone off to save battery it ends the call...can it be fixed or...?
It‚Äôs a disgrace that Facebook pushes the use of two huge bloated apps, every time those two are my most storage thieves.
Yupik
üåπüíêüíêüíê
This new update has made the app very laggy. Sometimes the apps would freeze while typing or while changing orientation.
Make it simpler to use. I do not like having to say 100 words when 20 will do.
This new update is ugly, I liked it better when it displayed whether the message was sent, delivered or read. Not what time or date I sent the message, if I wanted to know that I would‚Äôve clicked on the message to see. The old update layout before this one was better and I wish I wouldn‚Äôt have updated my app.
I hate that it‚Äôs a separate app. All I get is spam. Needs better look.
Do we need this? What a PITA.
I have notifications turned off in the app and through Apple settings yet I still receive notifications of a group call... it needs to be fixed
Please make it so users can save an audio recording to their devices; as well as some audio recordings will not play and just say ‚Äùerror‚Äù in the time box.
So you install facebook then you get a notification that you don't have messenger installed. If you don't want to install it the notification never goes away. So lets install it to get rid of the notification because i hate those red dots. Then i install the messenger app and immediately i have another notification when it is open because i don't have notifications turned on nor do i want them. Stop trying to force people to do what you want. If I don‚Äôt want to turn on a feature you don‚Äôt have to keep throwing it in my face until I do. I just rejoined facebook after deleting my account about 6 months ago and 5 minutes after having a new account I am ready to delete it again.
For some reason my Facebook and messenger have been disabled along with my phone number I used for them. It‚Äôs been about a mth now and I still can‚Äôt get back on.i think I have been hacked or someone else has stolen my acts. Please help, Kim hall 
I don't have room for an extra app. Why can't I just check my messages like before. Did this need fixing?!
Still needs a little improving but it‚Äôs an ok app. For some odd reason, it‚Äôs not showing who‚Äôs active. Even when I have that setting on.
Are you serious ??????!!!!!!! BRING ON CHATHEADS
Ads are very annoying. One star.
The fact that Facebook is going to make it mandatory to have this app with the main app is going to be annoying, then there is the fact that they can turn on my mic, or camera without me knowing is an invasion of privacy. I give this app and Facebook two fat thumbs down.
Wasn't a single problem I had until this new update! I never write reviews but this update is horrible! I have 3 messages on fb! Open messenger app and nothing! Friends telling me they sent me messages but I can't open. Also notifies me with people's video updates open messenger guess what? Nothing again!
This new update isn‚Äôt just not as aesthetically nice as the previous one, it‚Äôs not functionally as good. For one, going back through pictures takes a century whereas it used to be a lot faster. Secondly, the transition between functionalities such as adding a picture and typing is not as smooth as it used to be. You used to be able to just tap on the text box to start typing after sending a picture, now you have to manually switch back, which is annoying as hell. Also, for bigger devices such as iPads, you used to be able to expand the current conversation, and you still can, but the functionality of that feature as been hurt. The text box used to go all the way across the screen so you could see more of what you were typing at once, but it now doesn‚Äôt do that anymore. The only update the old version needed in terms of that menu was making the process of adding a gif smoother, none of the rest of this was necessary. I also don‚Äôt appreciate the unsolicited notification I got about syncing my contacts. Thanks, but I hate this update.
Messenger crash everytime open and close itself
I can see myself on chat fix it please
Please stop requiring us to download Messenger in order to check our messages. It honestly makes me want to delete Facebook as a whole.
I will send a message and sometimes it will send but not deliver to someone until they open the app. Isn‚Äôt a WiFi or LTE problem because it happens with either in different cities. Please fix this
Rarely works correct, thought it was my phone so i got a new one (upgrade time anyway).  Only downloaded it because it made me when i tried to send messages.
It says that I‚Äôm online and seem like I could message myself. Is this a glitch?
can you please please add the icon in the home screen that shows if a message has been delivered or seen? i don't like having to open every chat just to check if my text has been seen, i miss this feature. everything else is perfect though!
For an app that's been around for years you would think they would optimize it so it doesn't take a lot of space and also have features to where you could delete all your messages at once without having to sit and manually delete a convo one by one... I have messages from 2011 and I just don't have the time to delete them. It's ridiculous Facebook still hasn't provided those options  Overall, I've had no issue with sending and receiving messages and I am thankful for this app, but it's 2017 please optimize and give us options to delete ALL conversations at once 
I keep getting invites to install messenger DURING conversations with people ON messenger. I‚Äôve uninstalled and reinstalled, restarted my phone and nothing. Please fix this annoying glitch
So it‚Äôs been more then a month, and call notifications are not working either for android or iOS. Missed call notification is shown after the caller has ended the call, which the receiver could not receive due to said problem. Also, too many unnecessary tabs are shown in the app. No need for separate games or people tabs. Also lately, the app has grown way too resource and battery hungry. Fix this mess
You used to be able to see if someone had read a message just under the time sent on the right side of the conversation on the initial app page where you see all of your conversations. The option to see if it has been sent, delivered, and read is no longer there. You can see it if you open the conversation but not if you‚Äôre just in the main screen of the app. Now the time sent is next to the last message send and there is no indication. Why take something away when it was useful?
the fact that you have to download this app to talk to friends or see who's online on FB is ridiculous and Im sick of doing updates every 2 weeks wasting my memory fix it or go back to the original also why is it showing I‚Äôm online under friends list it‚Äôs pretty obvious I know I‚Äôm online
App keeps crashing for no reason. Even after just opening it to view a message. Connection goes to red bar and starts to reconnect, when we good wifi connections using other apps.
I really don‚Äôt like the fact that you have to go on messenger to text. I think that messenger should have the little pop up messages to open them right away instead of having to go on it. Messenger otherwise, is really good on everything.
can‚Äôt see read receipts from preview page now??? needs to be fixed
How do I turn on chat heads on iOS?
I wish the app had a feature to detect, delete and destroy chain mail requests!
Moving 5stars to 1 star, Was fine yesterday, but the camera is totally backwards now. Tried moving and flipping my phone differently so the camera could be how it was yesterday... still its backwards!!!! Tried updating too, still the same! FIX IT!!!!
There was an update 5 days ago but, this app still has issues and continues to close abruptly every time I open it!!!
I regularly use this app to communicate with my friends but we have recently been using updating any game you can use in messenger as a reason to temporarily kick the person that updated it. The updates are fine within private chats because it is between you and one other person. I am in a group of up to 11+ people and one update between A and B can be annoying when you are C and D-K are trying to sleep. If something about this can be done, that‚Äôd be awesome.
I love this app and have always used it but recently it crashes or closes after every time I send a message. Please fix!!
They removed the ability to see from the main conversations page if a messge has sent or is pending or has been opened.  Now you have to click on the person to see the status of the previous message.  So annoying!  So much more convenient to be on the main screen and see all your conversations and be able to immediately see which messages have been opened, which ones aren‚Äôt sending, etc.   WHY WOULD THEY CHANGE THAT?!?  You think it would be easier for a software developer to just leave it as part of the software..   so why change it?
Please give us the option to choose our own notification sound. That wretched ding is so annoying!
First, just the emojis went. I don‚Äôt even know how. Since iOS got updated, my emojis have gone back to looking normal like they would in my keyboard and other apps.  With the last update, I can‚Äôt see if someone has seen my message from the chat list itself. I have to open the chat to check if my message has been viewed. All I can see in the chat is the time of the last message. Why the hell would I want to see the time I sent my own message?? Can you stop making rubbish updates just for the heck of it? If there is no issue, stop updating the app, and first fix the problems that people are talking about. 
i love being able to call on messenger but more often than not my calls fail even when i‚Äôm connected to good internet.
Since the last few updates, at the main screen where it lists all my chats, it randomly won‚Äôt show the checkmark or picture icon showing a message has been sent vs viewed.   And sometimes I won‚Äôt get notifications I‚Äôve received messages at all until I‚Äôve reopened the app.  And I‚Äôve noticed sometimes while chatting with people, I‚Äôll have blocks of messages just disappear. Like I‚Äôll lose both sides messages for a 5-10 min block of messaging. Sometimes restarting the app brings them back, others it‚Äôs just gone....  I really hope they work on fixing this, as it is extremely frustrating. 
Boooo. All of a sudden The app says my telephone number is not connected to any account on here say what it says my number is invalid say what what what what what what a piece of crap I‚Äôm signed in on a different account I can sign out whatever I sign into this other device and it says my number is invalid?????? Fix it
I can‚Äôt see the indicator for whether messages are read/unread.  It disappeared yesterday.  Useless app if I can‚Äôt see the message status.  Please address.  Already uninstalled/reinstalled, rebooted.  Same issue.
Most of messages in messenger have sent, but have not delivered even when the person is/or has been active. At first I thought it was a connection problem, but the messages still don‚Äôt deliver if I connect to other WiFi sources or use my phone‚Äôs regular data.
Voice message loading sooooooo slowwwwww
I use IphoneX iOS 11.1.2   12/19/2017 
This morning everything was fine.. but now i dnt have the small icon at the end of any messages.fix this??!
Unfortunately, I know people who msg me on FB. It is stupid that I have to use thus app in addition to FB page or app to read them. I don't want constant notifications or prompts to enable either - leave me alone. If there was another way to network with my professional and personal contacts I would leave FB in a heartbeat. I hate this company - it is completely tone def.
When I send a message it does not show a check icon anymore so I don‚Äôt even know if the person is receiving my message or not please fix this !!!!!
I can chat whoever I want but not this close friend of mine. I tried deleting and redownloading the app but it only worked once. I even try to chat using the browser on the computer but it still won‚Äôt work. Please fix it. Messenger is convenient.
Why won‚Äôt this notification go away!!! I only want the badges icon up, which is an alert, and yet the notification to enable alerts is still there. Beyond annoying!
Recently, I just discovered that on some of my messenger games, all of my progress has been erased and now I am forced to start over again. This just makes me upset! Messenger is a great app to use when talking to each other, but erasing my progress on the games when you least expect it was not something I was expecting at all. There has to be a way to get your old progress back!
I have no idea why Facebook took away the ability to quickly see if someone has read a sent message from the messages list. It‚Äôs an extremely hard feature that was ripped out.
I‚Äôd love to get the old messenger emojis back (I liked the faces more than the iOS faces).  Also, would love to see it simplified overall when it comes to aesthetic. 
Too many messages from people I don‚Äôt know. Wish you could block users.
Am I the only one not being able to watch videos for free eggs etc.  I‚Äôve logged out. Logged in. Update. Delete app. Download app again. Delete conversations. Reopen using game tab on bottom....I‚Äôve run out of what could be.... and still not able to get ‚Äúfree‚Äù featured items. This is the 3rd week.
Miserable. Takes up too much space. Wish people could not contact me this way. Intrusive. Cannot delete. Delete and keeps appearing. Getting ready to be done with FB. Ridiculous. To limit being able to see messages unless using app is their way of accessing all of your contacts. Pigs.
Messenger is having difficulty right now ! , it‚Äôs not loading üíØ
Every time I open the app it crashes shortly after, not allowing me to see or reply to messages.
I\'ve never really been a fan of messenger from when it was introduced.  The practice of PM\'s directly to a member\'s page was stopped.  I was told if I wanted to PM other members I had to download the messenger app.  I use it mainly to communicate with my son when he\'s online.  I do enjoy playing the bingo game, but I have issues with that.  The timer seems much faster than normal.  I think the count of the bingos I\'ve had is off.  This past weekend, their practice of showing ads for a few extra points has not been \"available\".  This wouldn\'t be a big deal but, when it does come up, it pauses the game till you finish.  Because it\'s \"unavailable\", you\'re unable to continue to that game, you can\'t complete the operation.  I went to Facebook Support to report it, the statement that came up, \"Not everyone has the games available to them on the app.\". Guess I have to submit a note.
1- the app always glitches-2 if you guys didnt know you look at us through our camera and we gave you no permission- people, if u dont belive me look it up (nessenger sees us through camrea) creeps just creeps
Hey what‚Äôs your code for your email password code please thanks again please send me
New update hasn't fix issues for used to much excessive battery drain. Messenger very slow and excessive the battery .also drain RAM in playground but the worst in this app is has take to much lose battery and we should improving Messenger. Unfortunately that all updates considered as the worst.
I don‚Äôt like how it shows your personal stuff and getting harassing messages in Facebook messenger spam box telling me hope my ovarian cancer kills me that not nice someone needs to fix that and all of Facebook messenger and why do we need Facebook messenger when we have Facebook to talk to our friends
How about you make an auto reply option?!   Some people constantly send messages knowing the pinging drives me nuts and eventually I‚Äôll answer.   It would be nice if the sender could get an automatic response message instead of blowing up my inbox annoying the hell out me so I will respond. 
Stop spam emails!
YET AGAIN this app is USELESS with new iPhone update. Thanks for forcing people to contact me thru an app that DOESN‚ÄôT WORK. NEGATIVE 10000 Stars- I‚Äôm beyond sick of this monopoly BS. And now I‚Äôm going to send this review to you once for every single time I try to open Messenger and had lock up in the last four days. So expect to get this about 500 times And from the bottom my heart thank you so much for ruining the  holidays you f$&wits.
When I updated the app it now doesn‚Äôt load my messages nor does it allow me to see any of them.
All the money FB generates and Messenger app is garbage. It is breeding place for viruses and chain mail. Uh take a page out of WhatsApp page and lockdown the look and feel of it. Absolutely ridiculous. I hate the fact I am being forced to even look at the icon on my page with an annoying red flag for people attempting to contact me. #freemychoices
As a messenger and video phone app, it works well. But dang, stop asking for notifications and reading my contacts!! Big Brother is watching, and his name is Facebook!
I resent Facebook for creating a single platform and split it in two separate apps codependent on each other.
The app just keeps showing the loading screen on watch series 3 . Tried so many troubleshooting but nothing works so I‚Äôm guessing the app is just not working ..
I use this app only because it‚Äôs used buy Facebook.  If I could I would use something else.  I hate the fact it‚Äôs hard to delete text or even delete people you don‚Äôt want to communicate with!  I know you all genius‚Äôs could come up with something better.
Voice message Only Loading no update better
When you have the Facebook app it makes you download the messenger. If you‚Äôre using the internet you can‚Äôt check your messages without this app. Scams from Facebook on top of all the ads and commercials on the Facebook app ... no surprise
Keeps spinning and never loads
I was literally forced to download this crap before I can use the messages tab on Facebook. No option to turn off completely after each use.
Messenger keeps crashing, then won't load new messages. This is only making me deleting Facebook now.
Use the phone.
This app is a great way to contact other people. This could also be an alternative to texting, if you only want to text your Facebook friends. I was annoyed by the fact that I always had a notification and I didn't know who it was from, but I found out how to see who it was from. Five stars!
I can't delete messages!!!!!! I don't want a message to send a new friend a message. Please fix
Please bring back where I swipe LEFT and able to DELETE whole message! Please get back to me.
Keeps deleting my messages without me knowing
Please make your app more user friendly for people that are not electronically savvy.  Would like to see delete friends, delete groups. Ability to separate contacts without everyone being notified. Delete own Facebook account would be great too. There are people that have passed away over year ago still on FB and IM.
Dear FB, please, STOP pushing this app on us every time we want to read a PM! I don‚Äôt want to have to have this app just to read a message, and we should be afforded the opportunity to choose. Thank you.
Ok trust me Messenger is a focal part of my day and my all around social network. I find it cool that you want to have people install and use your app, but that pop up to invite to Messenger is really annoying and bother some. if I may recommend if you want to keep it as a part of your app, do it as if it a menu selection option on each persons info, not at the top where their name is.
I can not open it, it stays downloading all the time? It‚Äôs weird
No entiendo Xq ponen publicidad.
Since, the latest update I can‚Äôt save giphy‚Äôs or certain gif‚Äôs. Facebook can you please fix this!!!!!!
My messenger app is showing the name Facebook and not messenger under my name. I have done the most current updates for software and messenger. What has happened? Do I have to rejoin, delete app and reinstall? I DO NOT WANT TO LISE ANY CONTACTS AND MESSAGES. DEVELOPERS PLEASE RESPOND RIGHT AWAY PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I enjoy messenger but recently I got the update and now when I open the app, it is slow, sometimes real  slow to show conversations and other info. Please check on this. It is a great app, it just needs a little fix up. Thanks so juch 
Since this new update, I am unable to open up my message requests. It just keeps loading. Fix that and you‚Äôll get a better review.
This new update is horrible. You ruined the app completely. I could customize photos exactly how I wanted by moving the frames and borders around making them bigger or smaller. I could save the pictures and come back in and make it so the border was all the way around. I could search for anything and just keep adding to the picture. I was having so much fun and now it is awful. I would never have updated if I knew the change that was gonna happen, put it back the way it was. I hate it. I know there‚Äôs tons of photo apps out there but I loved what the Facebook messenger app had all it‚Äôs borders and stickers are so pretty and now there‚Äôs barely anything and the border is just stationary and isn‚Äôt even in the edge of the picture at all, so yeah won‚Äôt be using it unless I have to. Just change it back please.
GÀÄgÀÄ
I hate Messenger. Why don‚Äôt you make a simple one where the folk that don‚Äôt want all the crap can just send and receive messages. I‚Äôm tired of all the jumping reindeer and your going to die unless you send this flashing dog to 20 people. I try to block everyone who sends this junk, but you can‚Äôt unless you block them on Facebook. It doesn‚Äôt do any good to post on Facebook because they don‚Äôt read everything.
If the app just updated or something, suddenly its notifications are not working properly. I only get notified half the time when I get a message, and when I get a call it never rings, only later says I had missed a call. Frustrating.
I would give this app 5 stars but the app doesn‚Äôt feel complete it needs Siri App support I would like to be able to send a quick reply to my friends on messenger using Siri and my Voice
Unnecessary app
Esta demasiado mal no me funciona y no me deja ver mis mensajes se cierra o no me carga los mensajes
Why does it keep showing that I have a Messenger notification, and when I open messenger, there‚Äôs nothing there. As soon as I close the app, it shows a notification again. It did it once in a while before I updated it, but now that I updated it, it‚Äôs nonstop. Not a fan of this!
Ugly & slow
Pless
Your app prompted me 4 times in 30 seconds to turn on notifications.
Unbelievable. What a load of self promotion on the part of of FB. Just for that I‚Äôm literally not downloading the app. From the majority written here it looks like it‚Äôs doing a pretty poor job anyway.  Edit: Ive been without the app. I wish I didn‚Äôt have to download this app but I need to now I really hate FB for making me do this. 
I like this app and use it daily. But I noticed there is no GIF option. I just downloaded the Messenger Kids app for my daughter and it has GIFs. This app needs some updates!
I hate this application. It keeps on glitching and the messages need to load faster. I uninstalled this app in hopes of fixing the bug I had with my account and tried to install it again since I'm left with no choice and I'm FORCE to have this god forsaken application, but it's been giving me that "Messenger couldn't be downloaded at this moment." for 3 days! Get your crap together!
At best it is a mediocre experience. My biggest peeve is that if you don‚Äôt turn on notifications it will prompt you every single time in both FB and Messenger.
The app is great just the games are a bit off on the bowling one it will say you hit it when you Are far from it and the basketball one is a little slow other than that I like it
This is app is great when it wants to work on my watch. When i send an instant message through my watch it sometimes does not send to messenger. It will send it(sometimes) once i open the app on my cell phone. Hopefully this bug can be fixed!
Compared to previous versions of the app this is by far the best one but personally I think it would definitely be much better if a few things were changed on it. Even just the smallest changes could make it way better. Simplicity is key always. With this being said I think by making the main messenger screen less complex and having it to where you can go in the app and out quicker could have a great affect on everything including the ratings. Meaning having the Messenger App uncomplicated and more straight forward I know I would personally be happier with it and use it daily and as well as a good amount of individuals I know. For example if someone could get on message a friend & respond right back; almost compared to AIM or slightly like iMessage. It would change the game completely and have a higher rating guaranteed. Only asking to take it into consideration. :)
Desperate like a ‚Äòyou won a jackpot‚Äô popup webpage, this freaking ‚Äòturn on notification‚Äô keeps popping up. Super annoying & reminded me why on the 1st place I deleted this piece of junk. I DON‚ÄôT WANT TO TURN ON MY FREAKING NOTIFICATION. If I needed or wanted to, I‚Äôd do it. You don‚Äôt need to popup every time I open or even navigate away to check other app & come back. Have some respect & decency for the users‚Äô selection not to get notified. I check my phone when I want to & don‚Äôt want to be bothered by the notifications while working, but this trash of an app won‚Äôt understand that, nor will the dumb developers
Why is my time showing exactly beside my messages? Everyone else‚Äôs ain‚Äôt?
If you could please fix the volume issue that would be great.
When I would call people it would let me send them a voice message now it will just hang up without going to leave a voice message. I use the phone call on a daily basis and really need that to work for my business.
I hate Facebook messenger. When I get a notification that there is a message, it is always a pain to even find the message. The App is awkwardly constructed. I only attempt to use it when I am told there is a message. It needs a total revamp.
whenever i try to send a picture/gif it sometimes fails to fully send. this means i cant delete my pic/gif to stop trying to send it and it wont let me send any other messages.
My message icon on fab says I have messages but doesn‚Äôt show up in my messenger app have to go to the browser to open them
Exactly all of a sudden I don‚Äôt have messenger as usual for several years. Why?? Why do I have to reinstall?  I was very happy with the way I had it, but now no more!!!
please support smart invert color in conversation
I have 5 new requested messages and every time I tried to open them just keep loading them so I can‚Äôt I noticed it like 5-6 days ago
Used to be able to click on a conversation header and look up all images sent quickly and easily. Can't anymore.
NO FACEBOOK, I DO NOT WANT TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS.......
Having Problems With My Day . It‚Äôs Not Telling Me Who Viewed It An Will Not Let Me Select Who I Want To See it .
Nice work
This app won‚Äôt load! For a week now every time I try to open it, it doesn‚Äôt load. I have to delete it and re-download it to see my messages. Super frustrating.
This app has never ending bouts of glitches. Stop updating so frequently! It causes too many bugs. So many frivolous features- I wish they could be optional. I don‚Äôt need a rave setting in my fb camera. I don‚Äôt need floating emojis. So much unnecessary stuff that bogs down the app.
Last night. I was there for a Christmas party. I have been there at least 5 times, for wedding parties, holiday events, etc. This time , I wish I passed . The food lacked flavor. The salmon and pork was old and over cooked. The lamb too, was tough from over cooking. The service rushed over us and took food away , shortly after it was served. No smiles. Just authoritative looks to give them our plates and flatware, when they take them away. Slamming dishes into buss buckets, near our tables with no regard for our presence.  No one in our party was blown away with happiness.  The singers , had no business being up on stage. There were mostly flat and pitchy in their poorly  attempted performances . We drove 3 hours to get there and couldn‚Äôt wait to leave after an hour. Just want to say. I personally love this place and hope this was just an off night. 
Doesn‚Äôt open at all.
Why can‚Äôt I just see my messages in my google browser? I hate Facebook.
Excelente site   Me encanta messenger. Verdaderamente es una herramienta para comunicarse con todas las personas
Piece of garbage. Can‚Äôt save a photo. Double S$$T
I think there‚Äôs a Bug on the Apps. all my deleted messages came all back on. it was deleted. and so sudde  it appeared.
I don‚Äôt have a facebook account and do not want a facebook account.  On my iPhone app I‚Äôm allowed to use my phone number to login and use messenger. Apparently on the iPad that‚Äôs not allowed.   I‚Äôve tried for weeks to get any response from anyone on this item but no help is available in any form.  Once again FB proves that it‚Äôs money and not a fully functioning application that governs.  Any chance you‚Äôll get this comment?  Since I don‚Äôt pay millions of dollars to you, I do not believe I will even see a remedy. 
Volume is TOO LOW during video call. This is VERY annoying and makes for a difficult video call. When I try to increase the volume nothing changes :(  Please fix this!!!
This app has some major speaker problems as well as audio... Whenever I try to turn in speaker phone then it‚Äôll show that speaker is on but it‚Äôs really not and speaker doesn‚Äôt work at all, also, half the time I call someone they can‚Äôt hear me at all and the connection issues also keep on getting worse and worse, this app is extremely buggy, please please fix.
App is great, but the latest version sometimes does not load a voice message. The spinning wheel spins forever. I have to forward the voice message back to the sender for me to hear it.
good
Is there anything that can be done to better guard against spam and hacked accounts in Messenger?
I wish when I‚Äôm typing a message and I hit the send button it wouldn‚Äôt refresh and send me all the way back up to our very first time we started to talk to one another. This happens to everyone I talk to. The screen rolls all the way back up to the first time I‚Äôve talked to a person.
I have same problem with volume on iPad, but all else with volume works fine
This app was good when it first came out. Now it's slowly going down hill every time they "fix" a problem.
LET ME CHECK MY MESSAGES WITHOUT DOWNLOADING THIS APP. ALSO TURN THE MIC OFF, YOU SPIES. SO EVIL.

Sometimes won‚Äôt get message notifications, until you open the app !
I want the sound button back so you can change own ringtone
So many crashes!  Your friend ends call = quick freeze = instant crash  You try replying to a person by clicking the notification = opens app with endless a blank white loading screen = few seconds then crashes.  The sound could use an update. It‚Äôs syncing isn‚Äôt good, the face cam cam lag like a B.  Lastly, talk about quality of facecams. 
It‚Äôs not letting me send messages even with the latest version
Just downloaded it.  Does not seem to be getting good reviewsüôÅ
Really need to work on he video chat feature. Some times it works some times it doesn‚Äôt! But most the time it doesn‚Äôt! üò°
It‚Äôs bad enough we are bombarded with Ads when using Facebook in general. Now I can‚Äôt even open my messenger messages without having Ads mixed in with my messages.
This app has really helped me contact with others that are far way from me or close it's an app were you message people
I shouldn‚Äôt have updated. ‚ÄúStories‚Äù now eat up screen real estate when i just want to communicate with my friends.  No real changelog is a coward‚Äôs game. 
Convenient and easy !
When will ios be able to have the chat bubbles? It used to be a thing a while ago then you guys. Screwed it all up
It would be nice to be able to log out.  Thank you.
We need tickler back kept us caught up with friends  Why was it taken away ? 
It keeps prompting me to turn on notification every time! I DON‚ÄôT WANT TO.  Why can‚Äôt you respect my choice the first time i said mo?! 
The video call button is in the way so I always call people and sometimes the app just crashes randomly
I downloaded the app because the Facebook app didn‚Äôt have this functionality. Once it asked me to share my contacts on my phone I force closed it and uninstalled it, as there was no option to opt out. I got messages from friends telling me that they were notified that I downloaded the app.  I‚Äôm tired of all your privacy violations and I‚Äôm a very open person. It‚Äôs a terrible business model to make your users not trust you. 
Stop listening Facebook! Very creepy app and company is full of lies
please make it to where you can delete all messages at once. going through and deleting each conversation is not fun!
Enough said. There's no way to disable the "turn on notifications" message. I don't like being coerced by my software.
Shouldn‚Äôt have to have a second app just to check a stupid message.  Awful garbage, would rate 0 stars if I could. 
Exelent
super convenient
Makes things much smoother.
Use it more than my regular text app! I love the group apps. However, I wish I could go back to where I was on FB when I got the initial notification of a chat.
Idk when I updated it but I haven‚Äôt been able to use my messanger app for the last 3 weeks maybe. I have an iphone 6 and every time i try to open the app it sits on a white screen for like 3 seconds and then closes. Fix this bug please. I thought you would‚Äôve by now
I love to be able to talk to my friends
Constantly freezes, especially if you have the audacity to send a gif, which I do a lot of.
Need to be able to delete
I have the worst time. The app opens but just loads and loads then says that it can‚Äôt load the conversation. I have rebooted my phone and uninstalled and re installed. Same issue. I have great signal full four bars and also a WiFi connection of 50+ MBPS. Not a good app for my iPhone 8+.
Stop notifying me that my notifications are off when they‚Äôre ON !!!!! So annoying !!!!
I love it. The only problem is that my school blocks it now and the internet is bad in my house but that's not the apps fault so I don't see nothing wrong with it. I always use the app the call and text to all my friends, and even now it is getting better and updating so there is always some thing new.
Other than it's way too easy to call someone
Tired of changes on the spell check . It has not been working out for me. Could you go back to the old version. Other than that issue I love this app.
Wish the iPhone had chat heads like android does! So much easier that way!
Great app
Facebook is getting ridiculous! Making it necessary to download this app first, then they keep adding pointless stuff. This "my day" bs is so stupid! It keeps prompting me to add pictures i send to people to "my day". And keeps showing people's "my day" at the top of my screen. I don't care about people's day, if I did I would message them directly to find out what they are doing... Quit updating the app. We don‚Äôt need all this sh*t that you are adding. 
Not good really üò°üò£
Always reliable and full of new features. Have used for 3 years now without a flaw!! A must have to stay connected worldwide. Thank you Messenger!!!
Make messenger louder please the sound is terrible
I find it infuriating that I cannot simply log out of the app when I need. I share an iPad with other users and it is unfortunate that I can easily log out or switch accounts on the regular Facebook app, but not with messenger. I‚Äôm writing this review close to Christmas, and I had to delete and reinstall the app so other users wouldn‚Äôt become privy to the gifts I discussed with family members in conversations I would prefer to stay hidden.
I absolutely hate when someone calls while I‚Äôm on a messenger call and it kills the call within messenger. It‚Äôs so infuriating that it can‚Äôt handle a simple call.
It will not update location if/when in motion and says you‚Äôre still sharing your location even if you‚Äôve already turned it off.
The Facebook app forces you to get this instead of just use the regular messages tab within the Facebook app. It\'s creation was redundant (what with the previously mentioned already functional messages tab,) inconvenient, and really just a waste of space on my phone, but if you communicate with anyone through Facebook messages, you kind of need it. Even after deleting it, just seeing a little red dot lingering in the corner of the regular Facebook app any time you receive a new message, forces you to either go on your desktop or redownload the app just to check the message. God forbid you turn off notifications for the Messenger app, then a different little red dot refuses to let you forget that ‚ÄúYOU NEED YOUR NOTIFICATIONS ON.‚Äù I don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs why I turned them off. This wasn\'t revolutionary in design, yet Facebook is constantly pestering you to use it, and honestly whoever thought it up should be fired from the company.
I open up the messenger app on my Apple Watch and it never loads. Something need to be fixed.
Se torna pesado
I can‚Äôt figure out how to block someone. I followed directions. I might have to delete entire app
I love it!! 2 thumbs up!!üëçüëç
Suddenly Messenger is taking FOREVER to load. Can someone PLEASE fix this!!!
The messenger app in my iPad doesn‚Äôt open anymore after yesterdays update. It always crashes after being stuck.
The issue I complained about in a previous build seems to have been resolved. Thanks! Rating has been adjusted 
I really wish I could give this app zero stars.  If you don‚Äôt elect to turn on notifications, facebook sets a continue barrage of requests to turn it on every start AND resume of the app.
Facebook is desperate for my attention constantly. Their messenger app is so obnoxious and tries to force you to turn on notifications. It notifies you of this with a big red dot. Once you enable notifications. It gives you a different big red dot. In both cases there is a corresponding big red dot on the regular app that won‚Äôt go away. Facebook needs to stop trying to be everything to everyone.
I love this app
I liked when messaging on Facebook didn't require its own app. It also didn't require so much access to the things on my phone. It also allows notifications when I don't want them. If I'm not online, I don't want people able to call/video chat me. I hate the messenger app.
I used could delete messages after I had just became friends with a new person, now I can‚Äôt. And now I‚Äôm getting messages from ‚Äúmoments‚Äù. I need my delete button back.
Doesn‚Äôt work through Facebook!! Then when you open app through Facebook it sends you to the App Store as if I don‚Äôt have the app installed already. Then when I open it directly through the app it doesn‚Äôt respond the way it is supposed to! I‚Äôm not seeing messages through the app. When I finally do get on the app it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs like in a search part of my phone; as if I‚Äôm searching for someone or something. Then and only then I‚Äôm able to see all of my missed messages!! I‚Äôm so close to deleting this app!
It's very useful to use since I can only afford wifi as a network.   However recently I just noticed I can find the setting that lets me click non active.  It ends up appearing I'm active 24/7 which is misleading to my friends online.  Please find a way to restore it so I can deactivate to active feature on the app so people know I can't respond and that I'm not deliberately ignoring them if they IM me.   Otherwise I love the app giving it 4 out of ten.  Can you patch that please?  Idk if it's just my a glitch on my iPod touch or legitimately a glitch in the app... 
Messages sent via secret don‚Äôt deliver and I no longer get notifications of messages sent to me. This has been a regular and increasing issue for months, now has become intolerable.
The new update completely drains my battery. I went from 100% to 72% in less than 10 minutes after installing this app and opening it without even actually doing anything on it. Needs to be fixed ASAP
Too many HACKS with this APP Many friends have deleted it. I did but download just to get a message then delete againüò©üò° 
When I open my Facebook iMessage. It‚Äôs shutdown. Not able to access at all.
I hate the new messenger ads! Not only does it slow your app down and wastes even more data when half the ppl doesn‚Äôt even look or pay attention to the ads!  But this has been just recently!  I‚Äôm tired of seeing ads why I don‚Äôt pay for cable not going to pay to watch advertisements. I‚Äôll stop using messenger if these ads don‚Äôt stop or get even worse. Because it‚Äôs getting really annoying to have ads pop up on messenger. I feel like I can‚Äôt enjoy messenger because ads slows it down a lot! I don‚Äôt live in China! I don‚Äôt get 5g connection! 
It's good bro
I hate it. Put it back together with fb app. You get like a window the size of peewee hermins johnson. It doesn‚Äôt allow you to copy text and keeps bringing up stupid emoji window. All this like unlike stuff is dumb because most of em aren‚Äôt real people and ones that are WHO CARES WHAT THEY THINK! Most are idiots!
This updated is the worse. Forget about Video chatting,  I received a message five hours after it was sent to me. A photo was also the victim of this update. I receive the photo about three hours later. Fix this problems otherwise messenger is not needed. I didn‚Äôt think it could had gotten worse. It‚Äôs December 14,2017 and it did get worse. 
I'm good with the option, where if my text/imessaging isn't available. I can depend on the messenger. Same with calling from, option
They need to do something to make this app more secure. I would prefer more security and to pay for messengers than it to be free and spread viruses everywhere.
Every time has many options
Every time I open the App Store there is an update for Messenger and Facebook, it‚Äôs very annoying actually
But since an update or two ago(maybe longer) my messages no longer want to send. I get the ‚Äúsent‚Äù notifications next to my messages but they take hours sometimes to actually be delivered. I just want my messages to go through without me having to sit and watch to make sure they sent. I thought it was just my WiFi or something but it‚Äôs happened at home, at other people‚Äôs homes, with strong WiFi, everywhere. Please just make it so my messages go through!
I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôve ruined the aesthetic that I loved. It‚Äôs been months and honestly I hate that you guys took it down. I really liked them cause they were cute. And it was the main reason whyI actually enjoyed using Facebook messenger over other messenger apps.
Need chat heads for IOS !!! I want to be able to access messenger from any app like i could with my android!
I wish you could delete msgs directly in app. Frustrating
Reset code won't go through .
Facebook is using this app and all of the twisted permission that it requires of you in order to steal more of your personal information and quite literally surveil you. Delete this app.
For AGES (far too many flippin updates to count!) this app insists and indicates I have a message ...   but there is no message ...  instead, it wants me to turn on notifications ...   which are already turned on with the app and within the iPhone notifications too!!!!  Fixit or offer a switch to turn that off within the app. 
5 stars cause Brittany P went over and beyond as our server. Heart of gold and composure to match. My sister got physically sick and was unable to make it to the restroom. Brittany was kind and sweet and super helpful. Her quick response made the best out of a bad situation and kept the embarrassment of the situation to a minimum. We were very blessed to have been sat in her section.
When you get emails notifying you that someone sent you an email, the link in that email: ‚Äúopen in Messneger‚Äù does not open Messenger, it just takes you to the App Store.
I love having Facebook Messenger - I am a first time user of Facebook and by having messenger, it has connected me automatically across the world to family I hadn‚Äôt had connection with before and now I do. It has brought my life together with close friends as well that reached out to me from the 80‚Äôs that I lost contact with from the lack of using pen and paper. This way is instant and great üëçüèª Thank you Facebook.
Error this moment
Is there a reason you refuse to give users the option of turning off messenger invite? It REGULARLY AND RANDOMLY AUTOMATICALLY Invites people you‚Äôre trying to message even when you DO NOT HIT THE INVITE BUTTON. Please don‚Äôt tell me that is not accurate because I know it is. It just happened AGAIN. As soon as I clicked that person‚Äôs name it sent the invite. I 1000% sure I DID NOT It‚Äôs an inconvenience to say the least. As of today, I‚Äôm DELETING the app and no longer using Messenger until this issue is fixed. And by fixed I mean the user has the ability to turn off the invite feature. For the record... if I could, I would give the app a rating of LESS than 1 star.  Thank you 
Wish we could remove messages after we are done talking with the people.
Like It
Fun app but constantly the number one thing at the top of battery usage. They have to know this but do nothing about it. Fix the app please or provide a thinned down version. I don't know how much longer in going to keep using this phone killer
Since the update this morning my iPhone 6 Plus S does not open messenger. It‚Äôs just rotates. I‚Äôve closed the window, looked for new update, shut off phone and uninstalled and reinstalled. Still just rotates. I was using it several times daily now it‚Äôs blocked to me üòû
I need help can't send nor receive  messages....have to go through  SAFARI to get to Facebook...!!       HELP 
This half-arsed pile of shart is what you get when a monopoly go unchecked. A dismal toilet-scented quintessence of late capitalism. DOWN WITH FACEBOOK!
No,  I am not a nerd or techie, but I do know  when an app works and this one does not. It is probably the most confusing, disruptive, and disheartening app I have ever used. I always tell my friends DoNot communicate with me using Facebook Messenger. I have tried/wasted 15 minutes today trying to open  A message. I finally gave up. I am going to delete this app again once and for all time. I think you could try to do a lot better. 
Messengers new features ARE BOMB! I use Messenger STORY now so MORE THAN Snapchat! Great idea! Keep them coming
I think it's stupid you need a second app just to get to your messages. I get logged out of fb everytime I check my messages and its kind of a waste of time to open a second app to check messages when you use to be able to check them and reply right through Facebook. This app is ridiculous. I just tell everyone not to message me anymore. :(
I love using Messenger
Friendly Interface. Easy to use, fun stickers!
This app has helped me a lot to keep in touch with family and friends! I haven't had any problems at all!!! Thank you for tha great service!!!  Cathy
Hello and thanks..  Please consider the ability to delete conversations as I can do on the Android lite version.   Thank you. 
I just need basic messenger functionality and I already have the Facebook app.  It will be great if the Facebook app can read and allow to send basic reply.  I don‚Äôt use anything else from the messenger app. 
üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
How do you get the face filter?
Can you not delete more then one convo at a time in messages... kinda stupid with emails all they back to 2008
The messages don‚Äôt sync well with the watch.
This is literally the only way I can keep in contact with some people. I used to love this app. Thought it was silly it was a separate app at first, then the updates came. And I grew to love it even more. Then video chat. Then, updates to start competing with SnapChat. I hate that app. I think it‚Äôs pointless. Getting updates that mimic other apps started to bother me. Now? Now there‚Äôs ads. In my friends list. Ads. Facebook. You make stupid amounts of money each year. You don‚Äôt need ads in my friends list. I don‚Äôt have unlimited data. So, I might switch to only using Facebook on a computer and deleting the app from my phone. If it wasn‚Äôt for the fact I have friends and family I can‚Äôt reach otherwise I would have already deleted it and reclaimed the gigs of storage this app is devouring on my phone.
Maybe add a black color for the bubble texts? Please?
It's too clunky & tedious to get texts. There are still people sending me invitations to play stupid games!! Why use messenger when texting is really effective. I try to not use it. 
This horrible app violates your right to privacy.  If I log out it shouldn't show that I'm available and also why don't I have the option to "show offline"!!Fix this crap! I still stand by this review! This is a piece of garbage
Everything is running fine on my end. The video calling has been superb! Not one called has dropped outta nowhere and left me hanging. This update has done its job 101% and although I use messenger about 35 to 40 throughout the week, I would like some new features maybe some color chats or better notification sounds, something that lets me know theirs someone else on the other end calling me or trying to get in touch with me.   ‚ÄúNonetheless best updated in a whole a** time‚Äù 
There is a glitch with the icon, and the red circle with 1, 2, etc showing how many ‚Äúsupposedly‚Äù unread messages you have, won‚Äôt clear off the screen. The app isn‚Äôt that great anyway, and editing, deleting pics to save memory, etc., are not easy to use. If there was a rating of ZERO stars, I would have chosen that.   Currently when someone messages me, I immediate get there number and text them, as texting is a 1000 times better than this app. 
Make it possible to log out... PLEASE!!!!!!
every time i make a call al i hear is static
They try to force you to turn on notifications by leaving those red badges up even when you choose ‚Äòdon‚Äôt allow‚Äô or ‚Äònot now‚Äô for notifications. Irritating!
Facebook... a billion dollar company, makes the worst app on my phone, Messanger. It's so poorly made that it needs to be updated at least once a week... and on top of that, it's rarely able to connect to the internet. Who is managing this disaster? Good news is: this will allow a competitor to penetrate the market.
I was thinking truth or dare would be a fun game to add with it making people build a level of trust and a better understanding of what your friends are willing to do with a risk or taking less of a risk and to build a better level of a friendship to allow you to know if you can trust this friend of yours to help you out if needed (like a fight) or if they‚Äôll betray you
You should add black as a possible chat color choice along with more colors of the deep category and of the pastel category.
When u am trying to talk through the voice recorder it gets stuck and won‚Äôt let me send the message.
Everything I could say is already on other reviews, but I'll say this. Remove the share video button from being on the screen at all times. Its freaking annoying. It always gets pressed accidentally.   Funny that a multi million dollar company cant hire proper app developers. This along with the facebook app has so many bugs that its ridiculous. 
Every time I need memory on my phone, I delete this app and magically get 2GB.
Why would we need a Separate app to message people? They could easily insert it back into the normal Facebook app so what's stopping them? 
The X has been out for over a month now and there‚Äôs been 5 or 6 updates, and yet the emoji keyboard still covers the text input area ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
STOP THE UPDATES!!!
This works flawlessly on Android. But iOS, nada. I split them. Press send. It does nothing at all. I have to save each split. Then send separately.
Call Alert has become annoying in the alerts ????????
My Messenger app is frozen and I do t know what to do. I‚Äôve tried uninstalling it but now I can‚Äôt install it. Help!
I usually love this app but today it's completely whack! I can't message anyone! It just keeps saying connecting. üòù getting frustrated. Some messages go through a day late. Can‚Äôt answer some video. It‚Äôs a problem with all I talk to so there‚Äôs got to be an issue on your end.
This is the most obnoxious app I‚Äôve ever come across.  I don‚Äôt want to enable notifications!  Deal with it Facebook.  ‚ÄúTurn on notifications‚Äù is not a legitimate notification to be spammed with in the Notification Center or pop up box every single time I open the app.
Issues with action buttons at top of app sitting over time and battery status/signal. Can‚Äôt click. Have to reset app to hope t works.
Please make it easier to clear old messages. Would like to clear a whole page at a time. Maybe I‚Äôm doing it wrong but having to do it one message at a time is very time consuming.
Doesn‚Äôt let you delete conversations. Doesn‚Äôt let you delete contacts. You can only turn off notifications and block. You can‚Äôt revoke permissions after given. If you join a fab group they can just spam you with messages. You can‚Äôt delete them. Even if you press delete button. They just pop back up. It‚Äôs a trap.   Messenger needs to update and let us have some rights as users. 
I can‚Äôt see the last time my friends were active. I really liked when that worked
Nice messenger
Can‚Äôt send the message ! It‚Äôs not same as long before . 
I think it totally stinks that I‚Äôm forced to use the messenger app because they took messenger capabilities away from the mobile site. I don‚Äôt use the FB app because I prefer using the mobile site, but they took away the messenger tab. Pretty sure I bet they take away the mobile site so I won‚Äôt be able to use it on safari and they‚Äôll make me download the app. Sad times. God bless everyone and I hope you all have a Happy Holidays and a Merry Christmas! Be well!
Fix the notification! Someone messaged and calling me but messenger is not notifying!! It's like you're in silent mode!! Worse than silent mode!!
No me gusta
Who cares about the volume on Facebook video chat that‚Äôs why there is IPHONE‚Äôs.... never once thought I needed FB for a video chat... but yeah like she said step your game up!
Update, 12-12-2017, Now using the speaker phone is gone from calling too!  Why is Facebook removing features?! They are ruining it completely!  The last update totally changed  calling. Incoming calls do not behave like a regular call anymore, instead they are like any other message and on a locked phone it takes about four steps to answer a call whereas before it was simply a matter of pressing an answer button. Such a huge step backwards!!! I mostly use messenger for calls so until Facebook corrects this problem I am uninstalling it. 
I would like to be able to read messages without installing this app.
My calls don‚Äôt show up like my phone calls anymore it sends a notification and I have to open the app to accept the call. Maybe make a setting with an option of how your calls come through. Also it does not send me a notification when someone I recently called gets back online
Replying directly from notifications center doesn't work. The message either doesn't deliver or delivers severely late. This has already led to several inconveniences.
I wish the program did not exist.  Why when we have email?!!
Y'all need to fix messenger cus it won't download on my iPod
Fix your stupid messenger app. When you have important messages coming in and need to respond asap thats always when the stupid thing doesn‚Äôt want to send your message.
Installed this because messenger\'s the only reliable way to contact some people, and wanted to do that on the go without full Facebook. It works, but these sleazy jerks made me answer ‚Äúno‚Äù to sharing my phone‚Äôs contacts or enabling notifications like four times on setup. Every time the app‚Äôs focused I have to click ‚ÄúNot Now‚Äù on a popup asking me to enable notifications. There are two permanent red marks on the app interface: one saying notifications haven‚Äôt been turned on; one saying ‚Äúfind phone contacts‚Äù. This is a strident, annoying, user-bossing product. It‚Äôs a bad look for a company with a deservedly crappy rep.  Also has a weird animated gif  chooser that pops up w/ suggestions when it sees certain key phrases, and makes it *really easy* to send an accidental gif if you tap the ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù tooltip. App puts itself in the way of communicating too often. 
I wanted to say something encouraging to you after the complain ing and offensive remarks made (on the right  side of screen) .... I appreciate how easy it is to find friends and family! I like you Messenger ‚ù£Ô∏è 
Suddenly I‚Äôm inundated with messenger invites. I can send messages to others but everyone is saying they cannot send me messages and that it tells them I don‚Äôt have messenger though I do. ü§î
Why does this thing keep saying I need to pay to download it?
Things in here need to be fixed. Messages disappearing, and if you ask if I‚Äôm in a secret message......., says people are signed in when they aren‚Äôt. Just a mess now. Why do you keep fixing things that aren‚Äôt broken?
I hate this app. The fact that you have to download is awful. Can‚Äôt send a video. All these updates just making the app worse. I‚Äôm done.
Everything is wrong with this app. I am deleting it.  Let me know when you fix it.  If there was a zero stars rating, that's what you would get.
I know they have accepted my friend request or I have accepted theirs by the Facebook notification. It is so frustrating to have to open both apps to get rid of notifications of me being told to ‚Äúwave‚Äù at a new Facebook friend. Please take this feature out!!!
I‚Äôll apparently get a message on a Monday. But won‚Äôt get a notification on my phone until Tuesday morning saying I have a message. Please fix it‚Äôs very irritating
I don‚Äôt want notifications. I don‚Äôt want notifications. I don‚Äôt want notifications.  So stop asking me to turn of notifications. Stop with the pop-ups already. üò°üò°üò° 
Please make it go away - I don‚Äôt want to turn on notifications so now I‚Äôm stuck with a red exclamation mark!!! Ugh!!!!!
I‚Äôve just updated this app today and I have iPhone X. Earlier today I was voice messaging someone left a 45 second voice message. However, after update I am only able to leave a 10 second voice message. It just cuts off and sends it automatically. Please look into this and update ASAP! I will rate this a 5 when you fix this
Just a horrible app in general, Facebook messages through the Facebook app was way more convenient.
I love it because EASY TO USE!!!!!
Yes please The volume during video calls must be fixed That‚Äôs all 
For calling, remove the feature where if you‚Äôre on the call screen and click the off button kt ends the call, I keep hanging up on people because of this stupid ‚Äúfeature‚Äù Ive dropped multiple calls simply because I‚Äôm trying to save battery life, I did this last night during an important call and it aggravates me more than anything like why would this be a choice, anyways, just something to think about.  also add multiple notification sounds for messenger everytime a phone goes off I‚Äôve got people checking phones, ‚Äúwas that you or me?‚Äù It‚Äôs very distracting and a time waster 
This update screwed my app up. It can‚Äôt no longer load anything people sent me. It‚Äôs always connecting, such a poor user experience.
Been trying to use my messenger on Apple Watch Nike series 2. It stays stuck on the loading screen plz fix.
I get notified that I have 6 messages, but when I go to Messenger to read them, there are no new messages!
I go to this everyday a real nice way to have fb conversations but you have to keep switching from the conversation screen to the online screen to talk to people, also the notification doesn‚Äôt not leave even if you respond to a message out of app
Some words don‚Äôt show up from the persons text. It‚Äôs like invisible in a way and the notifications are also bugging. It doesn‚Äôt give it to me immediately. It‚Äôs sometimes delayed. Last week my friend wrote a whole paragraph to me and it showed up as symbols?? Why? Please fix this issue
Creating a separate app just for messages was the worst thing FB has ever done. So now, when I don't already have any storage on my phone you want me to download ANOTHER APP that takes up SO MUCH STORAGE BTW just so I can read my messages? Horrible idea. I should be able to look and read all of my messages in ONE APP. Please go back to the old ways. 
Muting a conversation doesn‚Äôt mute group calls. This is absolutely terrible and must be fixed. I constantly get bothered by other people in my chat wanting to video chat and it‚Äôs the worst.
With the recent update(s), you can no longer see how long a call is. I use the call feature often as calls are expensive on my phone plan, while WiFi readily available. The Messenger app developers have many reasons and opinions behind many of their features, but this one I do not understand. There is absolutely no reason that the length of a call shouldn‚Äôt be displayed in the chat. I don‚Äôt get it and it doesn‚Äôt feel fair. Messenger has been my most used app for the longest time, but bad updates like this make me wonder if that should change.
What‚Äôs up with this nonsense in the very top bar where the time is telling me that some random person is active?? I don‚Äôt care who‚Äôs active and I‚Äôd like to always be able to see the time.
This is a terrible app, very easy to be spoofed. I had someone trying to get me to try a get rich quick scheme pretending to be a Messenger friend of mine.
I give this a one star because people can access my messenger and use my messenger as theirs. They make a group that doesn‚Äôt belong in my messenger and they won‚Äôt go away. I can‚Äôt delete it because several people own the group. I don‚Äôt like this and I want it fixed
I will suggest to make different folders for business family or friends that were you know where the conversation left off I want to business or family and  you can decide ehat to delete or keep easier
Not telling me what‚Äôs in the update?    Then I‚Äôm not going to upgrade.
First of all, you cannot block people or delete conversations. I want to delete a conversation so I dont see it at all. Even in the app.
Won‚Äôt open. Just get a circle like it wants to open but doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm on my iPhone. My moms doesn‚Äôt work either and she has an iPad.
Latest version on iOS 11.2 on iPhone X. Crashes while I type replies.i get to type a word, app closes.
When I video call someone on Facebook I can hear them but they can‚Äôt hear me at all how can I fix it I got an iphone6 I can hear an see the person when I video call them on messaged but they can see me but they can‚Äôt hear me it‚Äôs not my phone it‚Äôs this app so can u fix it please an thank u an please help me fix it or write me back thank u
iPhone 6s Plus and it slows my whole phone down to a crawl or freezes it! Im not gonna choose between contacts and pictures for this! Stupid you even need this to read a message!
i don‚Äôt understand why a separate message app is necessary when any ther social media app can have DMs in app.. cmon facebook it‚Äôs 2017 and you‚Äôre still behind.
Very good
App will not allow me to log in.
Do something to help block people spreading viruses. I know this probably sounds stupid the way I stated that but something needs to be done about all these viruses coming through messing care and you guys are the only ones that can fix this issue, because it is BAD.
When i open some particular messenger chat bar, messenger & my iPhone get stuck. Please fix the bug asap.
I do have one thing to ask because ever since it got updated a few days ago I have no idea how to turn the Active Button off now? I knew where it used to be but now it‚Äôs not in the same spot it‚Äôs like y‚Äôall got rid of it or something... if anyone can comment back to me and let me know I would appreciate thanks üòé
i need to update my messenger but it isn't working . I can't see My Day and cant use upgraded features . It would be nice if someone helps me with this problem . i wrote too many times in troubleshooting service but nothing was done to help me . so i need attention!!!!
What happened to this feature??
The only thing I don't like about messenger is the way I delete messages now. I wish there was a all delete button or even to be able to select up to 20 messages at a time would be nice.
Problem with new version in iOS
I have games attached that I didn‚Äôt load and have never played.  I tried blocking them and they don‚Äôt go away.  I tried reporting them, they are still there.  What is up with that.  I hate this app.  Forced to use it to message in my phone with FB.  Just because you gave a deal with FB to force people to use you does not make you in demand for the right reasons.   Fix your problems before another app comes along and does a better job. 
No longer getting notifications that I gave a new message.
Unable to share FB articles in Private Message....  so sad that Users have to tell you what‚Äôs wrong!  Need a PAY CUT from department who screws things up!  Or get rid of the Messenger App -haven‚Äôt benefited from it - just a major ongoing headache!
It‚Äôs just a very glitchy app. I keep seeing deleted messages and cannot open new message requests either.
My messenger is so slow now and I know I‚Äôm connected to the internet it takes so long and I can‚Äôt even review my messages and my phone gets frozen
I NEVER had any problems with my messenger since forever, but these past days have been really bad! Connect-disconnect- connect is the usual cycle! Then I can‚Äôt receive my messages on time! üò¢ Hope you can fix this.
I feel insecure by using fb app and messenger. No matter how did I control my phone contacts, fb messenger & fb app uploaded automatically. In addition, I also did the tasks what Fb help center suggested.   Your marketing strategies are not safe for user due to privacy issue and ethical issue.  Tun 
I love spider and play it every day. The current ads that turn my screen are a real annoyance though!
- Notifications are forced - Intentionally has no mobile-browser version, which I used to always use - Takes up too much space - No reason for two separate apps - If you get a page, Facebook constantly notifies you that you need a THIRD app - Facebook is no longer about communication; it's about consumer data - Logging in and out is a pain - Also notifications are forced  Why can't people go back to real text messages? 
It would be awesome if I could delete multiple messages at once instead of just one at a time. I'm tired of old messages on my app and it's annoying when deleting them one by oneüò© all in all don't have much to complain about. Please fix!!!!!   Please and thank you!!!!!! 
Please add edit component to messages I write; so that I don‚Äôt have to be inefficient with copy, delete, paste, edit.   The only options now are Copy and Delete. 
that is good
thanks facebook for sucking
I uninstalled and installed the app and i still can't log in or see any if my chats, notifications pop up but I can't open it. It stays on the loading page but never logs in.. Can you help please..
Just did an update and now I get NO messenger notifications in FB! Otherwise same complaint as others, laggy, if I dont want in-app notifications quite bugging me about it, and you 'll have to provide sexual favors for my number too!
1) This app does not need to exist, I can be folded in Facebook app. In fact it was part of the Facebook app. 2) Fake notifications. Oh there‚Äôs a badge icon with the number 3. You would think it‚Äôs 3 messages, but no it‚Äôs reminders on Facebook to do what you don‚Äôt want to do, like have access to my contacts so something else I‚Äôm never plan to do. 
Even tho I send different videos one that I sent in the past is played instead every time
Messenger is great. My teams and clubs use messenger for a lot and I like how there are gifs and stickers and stuff that you can add. You don‚Äôt even need a Facebook in order to use it. I only have 1 problem  and it might just be a me thing. The Facebook emojis don‚Äôt work on my mobile version whereas they used to. Messenger switches out normal emojis for their Facebook emojis, and it works on the desktop version, but it doesn‚Äôt work on mobile anymore. It used to, but idk what happened. 
Add a changelog if you want an honest review!! There should be an un ambiguous reason for me to hit the update button.
Very annoying to have a separate app from Facebook... also keeps saying I have new message requests when I don‚Äôt.
I‚Äôve used this app with great success for the past 6 + years but Ever since I‚Äôve done the most recent app update my IM hasn‚Äôt worked. I‚Äôve reported this problem twice with no response from FB. The only thing my IM Keeps doing is ‚ÄúThinking‚Äù with the rotating circle. This is extremely irritating for me since I use this app to communicate with all of my Plastic Model Car Club members. Unfortunately FB now has most people under their thumb & when something like this happens we‚Äôre all screwed. In retaliation I‚Äôll most likely be booted for telling the truth in this post when all I need is the app fix.   (Update1) As you can see they‚Äôve posted my review but stupidly gave me the name ‚ÄúI‚ÄôVE GOT GAS‚Äù like a bunch a children. STOP PLAYING GAMES & FIX THE PROBLEM!!!   (Update2) Finally started working today sorta, but it doesn‚Äôt respond correctly. The circle still stays on the screen for about a minute then opens up the messages. Then it locks up again. .   GrUmPyüò°üá∫üá∏.... 
Dude I just wanna talk with my friends and sometimes get an awkward reminder that I‚Äôm apparently still friends with my ex‚Äôs mom. I don‚Äôt need Scientology ads.
-Badge Alerts on app are fake.  The conversations are Really OLD. This is to Force user interaction. -Also: permanent "notice" reminding you to Turn On Notifications.  Guess what I don't want to get notifications on your non-existing conversations!  If it was not only way to reach some friends I WOULD DELETE 
This version has ads
For the love of god, fix the volume issue.   It stays on max volume no matter what you do to try and lower it 
CYou and Yvan little kids MyHeritage k
I have the iphone x, when i open an image or link, it crashes.
I use this app every single day. I like it, usually works well. But I will say this... the messages I get when I accept a fr or vv......... that say ‚Äòyou are now connected on messenger!‚Äô Are RIDICULOUSLY UNNECESSARY! Literally serves no purpose whatsoever other than to annoy users and crowd our inbox. Other than that the app is great imo. Also, I‚Äôve said it many times before and have seen others suggest it too, please add at least a few more color options in the app. That is all.
It‚Äôs Made my iPhone slow, and the call appear on luck screen , I don‚Äôt like it I like the older one when there is no call in luck screen, thanks

It's a pretty good app. One thing is that people keep sending me a request to download the app when I already have the app. So that gets a bit annoying! I definitely recommend to get that fixed ASAP. Other than that I like it so far.
I lost my Facebook about a month ago heartbroken to find out have to start candy crush over as a beginner, I was 2nd in the  United States.  Now I have double messengers can you help me 
My volume is always stuck on loud as hell. I have to sit in my car when I video chat with my friend while my sister is in our apartment studying.  It‚Äôs ridiculous.  Besides that, I really appreciate the app because it allows me to video chat my best friend who doesn‚Äôt have an iPhone.
Would be nice to be able to search through conversations like you can on a computer browser.
I‚Äôm so done. Can‚Äôt even toggle my active list anymore without a hassle so I either have to be offline or online all the time and I like toggling it for peace and quiet! Always ‚Äúfixing‚Äù things that are fine the way they are!
I never minded Messenger, in fact I used it fairly regularly, putting up with the updates. Now, after this most recent update I HATE MESSENGER!!!!!!  I am sure I will end up deleting it before too long. I DO NOT care to see  "suggested people" u think I should freakin add.  If I knew them I would be friends with them on Facebook, but I DONT KNOW THEM WHY DO I WANT TO MESSAGE THEM????  Ugh! So annoying!!!!!  Quit updating!!  You're just making it WORSE!!!  Hopefully the next update is returning it to the original messenger.  Cause like I said, I'm on the brink of deleting.
I updated the app and for some reason it keeps crashing I tried to reinstall it, and even restarting my phone but nothing has worked please fix this problem
How do I show the message count? My sister is able to see how many messages she has in a conversation but I can‚Äôt see that.
I love Messenger I can talk to my friends all over the world. I use it a lot! But the stupid invite this friend to message in all my messages makes me so annoyed! It‚Äôs so easy to hit and I keep getting it and sending it. Please take this out and I‚Äôll give a 5 star. I know I‚Äôm not the only one.
Why is it not a way to change the notification sound.  I don‚Äôt understand.  I shouldn‚Äôt have to have my phone turned all the way down. Just so that Obnoxious notification sound doesn‚Äôt blow my ear drum out when I least expect it.   But seeing as how the app has 3.3 out of 5 it‚Äôs clear that it‚Äôs not the only issue with it. And I‚Äôm sure my feedback will go unnoticed to. 
I used to use this all the time but right now the app is down and have been down for weeks
How about letting me be able to view my message requests
Why make this the only app with no log out feature? That‚Äôs crazy.
Messenger is overall pretty good but I think during group calls, you should have the option to mute someone who is talking in case you don't want to hear them.
Don‚Äôt trust this app. They send ads/messages to your contacts saying it‚Äôs from you.
Always working for me! Keep it up!
Functionally the app works fine. But I have a few issues with it. Mainly my biggest issue is I think there should be a way to customize what notification sound plays when you get a message. I also feel there is no reason to have a tab at the bottom for people when home shows you who‚Äôs online. Especially when you can press the new message button in the top right. And finally while it‚Äôs pretty easy to figure out you can access the settings by tapping your picture in the top left, I feel be people tab at the bottom could be replaced with settings.
Messenger hasn‚Äôt been working for two days now. I‚Äôve updated it and deleted and reinstalled on my iPhone, and nothing. It won‚Äôt load.
Can we do without the constant notification that notification settings need to be turned on. Perhaps we DON‚ÄôT want or need notices coming on our phone when we aren‚Äôt on messenger.
Honestly can‚Äôt stand this messenger app! Can‚Äôt see what people post as their story I can‚Äôt be a vieja chismosa üò´üòøüò° hope you guys fix that in order for me to see stories I have to delete the app and re downloaded it and calls u can‚Äôt hear anything well hope your do something about this üôÇ
Messenger is extremely beyond worth your time to use! This is a great way to connect with people from Facebook and from especially other parts of your social life! I can't complain about this app even once!
I don't know why I have to open a new app when somebody sends me a message on Facebook, however I tolerated it because I had to. Now I just updated the app and it crashes and won't open. Good idea, bad execution of an app.
You used to be able to get on messenger and make yourself appear online or offline and since the last update it‚Äôs no longer an option.
I keep getting messages that I‚Äôm not able to even open... I‚Äôve looked this up online, and a step by step process is given, ‚Äúclick on settings‚Äù ‚Äúsee filtered messages..‚Äù blah blah blah... that‚Äôs all well and good, but my messenger app, letter A, doesn‚Äôt even have a ‚Äúsettings‚Äù option, and letter B, once I figured out another way to follow the steps (by clicking on people), there was no ‚Äúsee filtered messages link!?‚Äù Sooooo
This app is the best for messaging, single and group voice and video calls, file sharing, games!!!! I simply love it!!!
I never use Facebook but when someone is trying to contact me I have to download the app which I don‚Äôt even want. And then it keeps asking if I want to put in my number and why would I want that I already clicked no the first hundred times and the notification to enable notifications is completely annoying.
Previse ste glupi, ne mogu mojim drugarima iz skole srednje  da snimim pesmu, dusmani
So tough to delete messages
App crash
I have no clue why it keeps shutting down when I click on it. No way to use it.
Constant notifications yet no new messages. Annoying!
Fix your voice make record I‚Äôve waited for like an hour for a record duration 3 seconds
Easy to use...
I was forced to install this redundant app after attempting to read my private messages in the Facebook App. Never could retrieve the message! I quickly deleted Messenger. App is totally useless.
Good grief! This will not load!
Seriously FB, in how many different ways are you gonna ask me if I wanna enable push notifications? FOMO tactics etc, seriously? I refuse to download any of your apps bc you don‚Äôt value our privacy anymore!
I didn‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôd want or need this app at first. After all, how‚Äôs it different than texting?! But now that I‚Äôve used it for years, I get the purpose. It allows other friends to text me that don‚Äôt have my phone number or a phone & visa versa. Good job FaceyPage! 
I cannot hear the notifications anymore.  It does not even tell me if I have any until I go to the app and open it. 
I did an update for my iPhone 5 months ago and haven‚Äôt been able to use this app to make any ‚ÄúFaceTime‚Äù calls to anyone since.
Love it
Pick an emoji style and stick with it. It‚Äôs so annoying to have one style type, get used to it, and then have you switch whenever you guys feel like it. Was finally getting used to the what I assume is the android standard style and now you‚Äôve switched back to Apple style. Maybe you guys could spend a little more time making the actual application better than fidgeting with emojis and whatnot.
Please have a section for unread message!
the pictures that they send me and the days don‚Äôt load
publicite comme topface etc
Why does notifications need access to my contacts? I can‚Äôt allow notifications without giving you all of my contacts... which I do NOT want to do. Because of that I don‚Äôt allow notifications. Yet I am constantly requested to allow them . I find this app to be redundant and intrusive. I try not to use it but a few of my friends don‚Äôt have other text apps.
No matter what platform, Messenger is just terrible. Its been a resource hog, it does not respect privacy, notifies me of things i do not want. Im uninstalling it.
I hate this app. It notifies you incessantly about adding your number or contacts or allowing notifications, none of which I want to do because it‚Äôs just a FB chat app to me. IF I WANT TO CONTACT SOMEONE IN MY PHONE CONTACTS I WILL CALL OR TEXT THEM BEING THAT THIS IS ON MY DAGGUM PHONE. It takes too much space up and I already have the Facebook app so why do I have to have a second app? That defeats the purpose of the Facebook app so now sometimes I just delete the FB app and access fb through safari or I download the messenger app and check messages then promptly delete it again after. It‚Äôs a hassle. It‚Äôs annoying. And I just don‚Äôt see the point of having two apps when you could consolidate them into one great one. I liked it the old way and I don‚Äôt like being locked out of my personal messages unless I download this app or get on a computer. Ughhhhhhh
I‚Äôd give it a 5 star but I cannot cause you guys don‚Äôt have a chat search feature, I like everything else but this is something that really bugs me.  Please PLEASE add a chat search feature where you can search for texts in particular chats  I think a lot of us will appreciate that 
It listens to everything you do
Dr Oliver and staff are the best. He repaired my wrist and hip very successfully and I am grateful     I also want to thank Boone Hospital for all of the great care as well
My messages stay in ‚ÄúSent‚Äù for hours and are delivered randomly later, making this app useless until the issue is fixed.
I‚Äôm not sure how else to report this, but I have an old connection request from someone who is now a friend... the actual connection request is gone but I can‚Äôt get the notification to go away! I can choose ‚Äúdelete all‚Äù under connection requests (even though there isn‚Äôt an actual request to be seen) and it will temporarily go away, but it always comes back!!
Messenger is telling my friends that they can‚Äôt message me because I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot on messenger‚Äù, but I clearly am. The app is installed on my phone and I use it on a daily basi.
add account options
What it‚Äôs the point of a search bar of you can‚Äôt search for key words in conversation?!?   If you get messages from sales posts or groups or anything, unless you remember the persons name, there is no way to go back and find it! It‚Äôs insanely frustrating 
I'd give five stars if the call quality was improved.
Read its new privacy policy folks. It has right to access to your phones internal operation including GPS, BT and contacts.   Just uninstalled it. When will tech ever learn. They are pushing the limits all the time only for people to push back. 
The app, as long as it‚Äôs open, gets the job done but there are a surprising amount of bugs for how often they update the app. Sending messages from the lock screen always hangs for me until I open the app (on both iPhone 6 and 8 plus.) and sending certain media will crash the app. Don‚Äôt rely on this app to get your messages sent. Use the desktop version if you can.
Notifications come through but trying to access the actual message from watch (Apple Watch 3) goes to a never ending spiral of dots. Absolutely never ever ever works.
Messenger and Facebook will never get more than one star from me as long as they require you to download an extra app to view messages. I don't care what features you add to this app, it won't justify two separate apps and now I don't use either.
I love using the Messenger app however, I find it extremely annoying that people I am Friends with on Facebook have the option to message me at any hour of the night. You should definitely have an option to block certain people from messenger without having to unfriend them on Facebook. Also, this past week my ringtone has changed to a very low volume as well as a different sound. This is quite frustrating as I now can't hear when I'm getting a call from messenger so if I'm not sitting by my phone I miss calls. You've got the right idea but definitely need to correct these issues.
Works reliably, but nothing flashy. Still looking for killer features
Consumes huge data and battery.
Delete this app and put messages back in the Facebook app, having this takes too much room in your phone and not enough space is on the phone. Besides your way to prevent us from messaging people on the other app is dumb and messenger is a pointless, piece of crap to have and use.
can you pls put chat heads for easy access plsssss
No problems!
There was an error loading the upgrade and now my app is just waiting...
Could be better
I love the infinity games.  Can‚Äôt get enough. Absolutely fascinating. Highly recommend for all ages.
Please guys add chat heads on ios its so comfortable and usefull only thing i like about android messenger is that i can chat and do other things on my iphone so please have in mind about modifieing messenger app
I think there is no need to browse any website on messenger.We use multitasking and its preferable. It‚Äôs embracing for me. When I have to know some information and the link is given in the inbox.it directly took me the website ,at the same time I can not access other conversation box.its really irritating .I think it was better to browse any website with a browser not with messenger.Browsing with facebook is ok.but browsing option in messenger just disgusting and it's not efficient at all. üòèüòè Another problem is that. There may be text length  limit which don‚Äôt allow me to send a long lengthened text. This is also so so irritating .  I hope u guys will fix it out in the next update. 
Whenever I try to edit my profile picture this app doesn't allow me. I wanted to delete it so bad, so I Googled and followed the steps but for some reason you cannot find the deactivate button. Save yourself a headache and don't even bother downloading this app!
Not sure why Facebook decided to make an app just for messaging and it's not even an option cause I tried for the longest to not get it but it's annoying. I like being able to call from messenger but don't like that's it's a separate app from Facebook.
There is NO reason for this app to exist separate from Facebook besides giving Facebook an excuse to rummage through your contacts to get even more invasive information about your daily life. Simply put, it‚Äôs bloatware.  You can\'t even open up Facebook messages in your mobile browser of choice anymore, you HAVE to install the app, because otherwise FB is holding your messages HOSTAGE.  All it does is take up space on your phone and take more of your info. It\'s bloatware. That\'s all there is to it. 
What you need to fix in this app is to not notify the group chat that you had left the group because they just keep adding you back when you don‚Äôt want to be added back. Like seriously.
I hate having multiple apps. Why can't everything be bundled together in the main app?
Great. Now there‚Äôs three tabs I don‚Äôt use. When will there be a messenger lite version for iOS?
Used to be such a good platform, but it‚Äôs turned into trash. Messages don‚Äôt send, volume is extremely loud which is annoying. Main problem messages don‚Äôt send and never get received.
First off, I hate that people weren‚Äôt given the choice on wether they want to use the app or not.  Now they have added ads to the app.  The ads are so annoying.  I will probably be deleting this app since the ads will surely continue on.
Would be great if Facebook messenger would support 360 photo and video playback..
To chat with reactive friends, Uninstall and reinstall....repeat -_-
Working. Very nice!!!
Awesome messaging app overall, I‚Äôm just suggesting a thing to where you can share screens on your phone/computer. Thanks!!
Works great, easy way to communicate with Facebook friends and family, it's a great app
My favorite texting app, preferred over iMessage.  Better in every way except with Apple Watch. The Apple Watch app has  syncing issues, enough to not be useful so I don‚Äôt use it on the watch. Here iMessage reigns supreme. Perhaps one day messenger will work remotely from iPhone with Series 3 LTE and this issue will be mute.
Messenger is very useful, including the free phone call and video chat features. My main complaint is that people can flood your in box with junk videos and messages, and there's no easy way to prevent it.
What else would you need from a messenger app, does everything +,
I hate having to down load this just to see my messages on Facebook. I don't like too many apps on my phone and being forced to have this on my phone is really dumb. Facebook just like any Sofia media has been ruined with so many updates. What a shame. Let's see what else gets updated to ruin face book. I don't even log on face book much anymore because I see message notifications and I get curious and I down load the dumb app over and over again. Thanks Facebook.
I had to delete the app and now I can‚Äôt reinstall it from the cloud, ant that is my only option.
I love the connection with my friends. I hate that I'm constantly being surveilled. ToS are really a steaming pile. Thymes are unethical and choirs be illegal.
bust a big nut for FB messenger
I only use this for communication between friends. I really dislike having notifications from other things I don‚Äôt use like the discover page. A nice feature would be to be able to pick what notifications you want to receive (I.e. choosing to opt out of discover and games). I also dislike getting notifications when I make a new friend on Facebook, I already know that I can now message them. I don‚Äôt need a notification stating so.
This Program will not complete the update it just keeps running, running, running and using up all my cellular data. Can you please fix this!
I've been on messenger since it began and by far this is the best update ever!! Thanks FB team!!
Messages and whatnot
I love it so much
I have to give Facebook messenger five stars it‚Äôs completely taken over my life I know no longer communicate with anybody who‚Äôs not using Facebook messenger I like to video call people sometime so I can look at them and not have to be in the same room as them it makes me feel like I‚Äôm being friendly with people
I hate the fact that I can not get rid of notifications from FB letting me know someone messaged me. My phone, tablet and computer go off constantly even though I deleted the messenger app. So stupid. Also, it‚Äôs a complete waist of memory for my phone, why can‚Äôt I just have the original FB message instead if having to download the app
FB Messenger is no longer a secure app because spammers are now able to use your friends messenger accounts to spam you. I‚Äôve received numerous spam messages from many of my FB friends that hardly use messenger and once they realize their account was hacked they uninstalled. Today I had to do the same because spammers are having a field day hacking into people‚Äôs messenger sending me crap and I‚Äôm tired of ignoring it. It‚Äôs not fair to make us install this messenger to view our messages if you can‚Äôt keep our accounts safe from spammers hacking us. Fix this issue and I will reinstall.
Buenas tardes ,messenger me parece mucho mejor que WhatsApp,y me gusta mucho sigan as√≠ actualiz√°ndolo mucho mejor
I have messenger but no longer Have FB. Since closing my FB page I can no longer share videos with friends within the app. For example someone sends me a video, I cannot forward it on to anyone else.  Now I can take a YouTube video and share that which I think is nuts.  I can text, share my day, upload anything from anywhere else and share EXCEPT Facebook videos! That is completely bizarre. I am thinking of deleting the app. 
Nice app
Why remove the messaging feature from the regular app & force is to download another?  This is a stupid move. I only downloaded it to leave a 1 star review. 
This is my first review ever in my lifetime, and will likely be my last. Facebook&Messenger is that horrible for non-frequent users. I only use the messenger when I need to contact someone not saved on my phone. So a few times a year maybe. For that reason I want the log out process to be easy so I won‚Äôt fail in the 10-step process, and continue to appear ‚Äúactive‚Äù to others every time I use the connected facebook app, which is the case that deserves another review of its own as one of their many horrible set backs despite being the biggest SNS service. Each time I use facebook messenger they have updated the app so the logout process I used before has a high chance of not being applicable anymore, which leaves me to scavenge for the latest method. Any app/service that relies on its annoying opt-out processes instead of improving their service in order to increase their user pool deserves to be ridiculed. 
I always forget how to delete the messages ..it's like a task to do so every single time .. at times some messages show up as notifications on my phone and others they don't. .. it serves a purpose I suppose but it's too easy and quick to jump to new things like taking a selfie or "add to your day"...the basics have. Even lost and the EASE of use is not as easy as it seems for certain tasks ...
This app is stupid, senseless and useless. It used to be a part of Facebook, now we are forced to use 2 apps for one program.
A lot of crybabies wanting this to be whatsapp but this is a nice alternative i like it
It keeps chatting private
I have a iPhone X I can‚Äôt make calls when I try to make one on messenger it shows that your call failed please fix that error.
I know messenger is a free service. And ad revenue is the main source by which to pay all the salaries of facebook employees. Normally I don‚Äôt mind an ad or two on my Facebook feed.  However I do not want an ad in my chat apps. They are intrusive, the content of the ads seem to be aimed at me through the filtering of my conversations in the messenger. It‚Äôs bologna. I‚Äôm going to stop using messenger until you remove ads.  Or add an opt out.
People should be grateful for this app bc it's easy to find lost person also make getting in touch easy
Messenger is a huge joke being forced on Facebook users. We have to update so called bug fixes but NOTHING gets fixed, the opposite happens, more issues! Can‚Äôt delete conversations anymore, or delete when someone is new to messenger. To many issues not to mention it takes up data and contently having to update and the problems get worse! Go back to where we can just read messages off of Facebook while we are on our phone!  I wouldn‚Äôt even give this app 1 star! I hate Facebook is shoving this down its users throats! 
G R E A T ! ! 
EVERY time I want to answer a video chat, it takes me to a blank screen & I have to close the entire app & reopen it to answer that same call. It‚Äôs really annoying because I can‚Äôt simply answer the video chat right away & sometimes I end up missing the call since I took too long to answer. üòí ALSO, my volume does not adjust. EVERY time I video chat someone, my volume is super high and loud, no matter how much I turn it down, it STAYS loud. Please fixüôèüèªüò© 
I do not want to share my contacts and I do not want to have non stop notifications. This is made quite painful with the way you are building this app, Facebook is way too aggressive
Live and work away from family, friends - messenger helps keep me in touch with everything thru pics, text, calls, video callls, groups - it can't be beat!
How do I delete the latest messenger update?
Maybe I‚Äôm missing it, but there should be a way to limit the people who contact you on Messenger to just the people you want, such as friends.  For a company that claims to be all about privacy this is a huge oversight.  Recently I have been having complete strangers text me on Messenger and Facebooks only solution is to block them after the fact. How about not being able to contact me in the first place?!!!
I don't like how I have to download a seperate app to see messages from Facebook. Thank you. Merry Christmas.
Awesome
A great way to talk to your friends and family
The (lack of) stars speak for themselves.
Latest update apparently cannot take no for an answer.  Every time you open the app it asks if you want to turn on notifications if you haven't. Multiple times.   Seriously. If we want them, we will turn them on. Asking once is enough. If I wanted to keep answering no to the same question, I'd go to a bar.  Update: Still not taking No for an answer. Seriously?!?! How have you not fixed this yet? 
Please add a button to check multiple messages and be able to delete right now you have to go into every message and with Xmas around corner and people selling things I message a ton of people with the same things if I‚Äôm trying to get them and then I have so many messages and it is super frustrating doing it one by one why not add a button like the iPhone has to edit and select which message to delete!!!
This app is great, but you know what will make it better? Implementing Chat Heads or Chat Bubbles! Like the Android devices have? I want to be able to message and be in a separate app at the same time.
The amount of advertising that you are pushing on us is getting ridiculous! I just had to hide an ad in my messenger! On the verge of deleting Facebook and messenger both.
The text area is obscured by the keyboard so you can‚Äôt see what you type.
It's a great app to connect with friends .
Sometimes crashes
I am going to remove facebook and messenger completely off of my phone. I don‚Äôt want to see the update every week, it is getting really annoying and frustrating. Messenger doesn‚Äôt need to be updated because there is nothing to fix in it, it is just to refresh app ratings, nothing else, nothing. If I see another update again in 2 days, I‚Äôm going to completely get off of facebook and remove my account from it.
R·∫•t t·ªët c·∫ßn ph√°t huy h∆°n n·ªØa
I have no issues with this app whatsoever. I don‚Äôt know why others complain. I‚Äôm not using it constantly like I do use WhatsApp or iMessage but I do use it everyday and there are no glitches or any other problems.
1. I hate that you can‚Äôt adjust the volume during a video call. It‚Äôs either waaaaay too loud or super quiet and no matter how much I press the volume key. Nothing changes.    2. As of this new update, whenever I send messages to an online person, my messages will send but not deliver. Why is that?? 
It is just stupid, takes lot of memory and I hate it because I have to download it and I don‚Äôt need it because I have Facebook in my search engine but no, I have to download it because you are stupid. For one message in a week a have to have this stupid app.
At the most inappropriate times you manage to invite someone to Facebook message because of where they put the button.
‚ÄúWe update the app regularly so we can make it better for you. Get the latest version for all the available Messenger features. Thanks for using Messenger!‚Äù   Stop doing this and post a better changelog. 
Facebook Messenger has really been pretty horrible lately. It used to be pretty good & I would know, specifically its video feature. I speak with my girlfriend over video chat often & it is really bad. I wish she had an Apple product like an iPod or something so that she could FaceTime with me because this video chat service is just really bad. It has to improve. Too choppy, too glitchy, too freezy, unreliable. I even have a range extender on my Wi-Fi Network + I‚Äôm the only one on it & she has the same & we will STILL have issues. It‚Äôs really bad & needs to improve. 2.2 rating from me as of the last month. Down from last month‚Äôs 2.9 rating.
Confusing and not user friendly. Rather just text then have Facebook keep everything you send and receive
Why is it updated every week yet nothing changes? And every time I update I lose all of my stickers for at least 2 days?! This is ridiculous. And I'm always getting invites to messenger from my friends........hello...I'm ON messenger. This is the stupidest app I've ever used.
I believe the app used to have a notifications section separately.  But now the only way to set ur notifications is by going through the iphone‚Äôs settings and changing it from there. I‚Äôm not talking about the mute setting for each individual conversation but I‚Äôm talking about it as a whole.The app is getting worse day by day. Plus too mch advertisements are very annoying.
Does anyone have this problem!! I cant see the pictures I send through messenger!! I deleted the app, rebooted my phone and nothing !! I have over 300 pictures saved in messenger with my friends!!
Please do make a chat box pop out when someone‚Äôs sends a message its so hard to change screen while doin something or even okaying games or watxhing movies this i gross, and the app is crashing oftentimes or message‚Äôs not appearing it will take a minute please do fixed it bc we don‚Äôt have any options messaging through fb without this.
This app. Is great. What not makes it great is there is no more privacy. People can see you online and message you at the same time when they see you online and you don‚Äôt reply to them. And the next thing they see is you‚Äôre already offline. PLEASE TAKE THAT ‚ÄúACTIVE NOW‚Äù off the app. No volume control on video call its always turned up. no matter if your volume is all the way down.
Why the hell do I need an app to show me Facebook messages? Why can‚Äôt you just view them in Facebook, oh wait, you have to spy on our conversations, so you target ads towards us, based on our conversations...
Too  Much 
This app used to be great but over the past few weeks messages take forever to deliver! Sometimes very rarely they deliver right away, but mostly it takes minutes, hours even days to send one little message!!
Can‚Äôt download because it says it needs me to sign in to my payment info
Deserves zero stars. I absolutely hate this app. It is slow, and I resent having to use a seperate app for FB messages. I can barely message anyone without accidentally sending them an "invite to Messenger" by mistake, because the button for that is RIGHT THERE where I am having a conversation. Hate, hate, hate this!!! Please bring back Paper! Update 12/6: I hate it even more now that it has suggested responses and suggested people to chat with! 
Latest update added giant ads in your message list. That‚Äôs worth one star on its own, but notification alert volume is still broken too. Horrible.
I don‚Äôt get why messenger has a log out button. There should be one.
Went to FB  to post in messenger and it updated and now Messenger in Facebook is GONE- and it goes automatically to the outside app, when all of my contacts were in Facebook! WTH?  No! My contacts don‚Äôt get a new invite!
His version doesn't work!!! Fix it! It gives an error "can't load secret conversations"
Update December 6 2017: Ads inside of the Messenger app? Welp, I deleted FB in part because of the overload of advertising. Then I did the same with Instagram. Now, bye bye, FB Messenger.  Update June 19 2017: Please fix the software so that I'm not constantly being asked to turn on notifications for Messenger. I am not turning on notifications for Messenger. This is incredibly annoying and I don't mind getting rid of this mode of communication if I continue to experience this. Thanks. 
Really need to get a faster way to delete messages. Hello did you come up with a faster way to delete
There is no way to change that annoying default ringtone this app has
I turned Messenger off by accident. I need help getting it back on?
I LOVE using messenger, however the new update is having a really rough time buffering! Please fix!
Varios amigos tiveram v√≠rus por causa do face book messages
I‚Äôm receiving my messages late sometimes when you talk to them on messenger for a while ! So I‚Äôll haft to send another message and right when I do the message that they sent earlier comes right when I press send for the second messages it won‚Äôt even let me know that they read it or that they were recently online . Messenger was never a problem like this for me until this year .
I love messenger! It seems though with one of the latest updates CallKit no longer works and needs to be fixed. Having the calls integrated into the iOS operating system so flawlessly was nice, and now I get the annoying banners and singing noise rather than my contacts ringtones.
It keeps crashing. Please update soon.
Unreliable, inconvenient and not easy to use when it works.
Why can‚Äôt you delete old messages
This app deserves zero stars.
Extremely unstable since iOS 11. The app crashes when I try to open it, and I am unable to share anything from other apps.
I mainly use this app to read chats from friends (as opposed to video calls) when I am roaming around, but after the last two updates (latest on 12/5/17), the app crashes every time I try to open a new message. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I force quit the app and try again, I can‚Äôt ever open the message.  It‚Äôs basically worthless now.
Something seems wrong with this app.  In my opinion, If a virus or hack is going to happen it will be through messenger.  I load this app when i get a message then unload it after I read it.  I only use it because fb jams it down our throats. 
Latest update Bricked my iPad & iPhone
Ok look, the new calling B.S. is just that. It‚Äôs stupid. Having to unlock my phone for a call for FB is extra steps that shouldn‚Äôt be taken. Change it back to the old way and almost everyone would be happy.   Please add customizable ringtones/notifications. People have been asking it for years and nothing has been done. It‚Äôs quite stupid that you haven‚Äôt done so. You wonder why people are using different messaging apps.   Also please add custom backgrounds. The white background with just different color bubbles is plain boring. It reminds me of iMessage. Be different and listen to your users, it‚Äôs not hard. 
Obviously there is some kind of bug AGAIN!!! Can send messages!!!
Is there any way from blocking people from messaging u?
Why is the file size so big?why does the problem not open sometimes? Terrible app
NSA spy tech approved. Say good bye to your privacy.
Can‚Äôt tell you how many friends I‚Äôve notified were in the process of being hacked.  Another one today that either tried to call me, or was stupid enough that they just hit the wrong icon.  When is this app going to clean up its act?  Now I feel like I‚Äôm at risk having to change all my passwords AGAIN!  I won‚Äôt use it ever again until it‚Äôs vermin free!
Positives: Very nice for video chat, Sending photos excellent! Convenient to see who's available for group chats.  Negatives: Sometimes typing lags but may be a phone issue and not the app ...unsure. 
What I like about messenger is that I can send messages to some of my friends on Facebook, then they would message me back.
Fair
Sound on video still needs work. Still either lagging or just stops playing after 15-20 seconds.  Video still needs work... after video starts to either lag, loop, freeze everything or stop playing, everything starts to loop instead of the sound. There‚Äôs no sound at all after. 
Love this app
I'm not receiving messages from people
Zero Stars Stop Spying On People üñïüèΩ
I don't like it,it won't load half the time.
I am tired of being alerted that my notifications are off. I know that, and I want it that way. I wish the app would quit asking. It keeps making it look like I have an unread message. Please change this small issue and I‚Äôll be much happier.
I'd say fb scored with this one
I shouldn‚Äôt have to have something & if I don‚Äôt I get constant alerts and a stupid red number on my FB PAGE.
Set up a PIN option of calling us and saying the PIN. Other sites do it.
Messenger has been around now for what 2-3 years now?  You'd think they would have improved it by now.
I really hate the face that I need to have this app in order to write and view my messages...!! It's good in a sense that I can reach ppl right away and call and video chat but other than that it takes up way to much space on my phone and it has a lot of glitches..! It's an okay app...!
I hate I when I call somebody it shows up on my phone call log üò°fix it please
I can only send 1 message, more if I‚Äôm faster but it‚Äôs constantly crashing lately, it‚Äôs updated and my iOS is updated as well, idk if it‚Äôs because I have a 6 Plus but it‚Äôs been crashing a lot :(
love it for messaging, calling, and video chat üí≠üí≠üí≠üí≠üí≠ 
Y'all need to fix this app I have people online but I can't message them because it will send but never deliver I'm tired of this sh#$ fix your broken app
I was being nice with My Friend Lena for today!
Won‚Äôt let any video messaging work after new update! üëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèº
Please fix it.
Hello can anyone please help me? I have the latest version of messenger but it is still rounded on top.. how can i fix this and get normal latest version which is shown here on photos? my friends have it like here but i still have rounded corners
I don‚Äôt like the new edition that cuts the calls when receiving a normal call or even whatsapp call!
Awhile ago, I tried sending someone a long message and I had never messaged them before. It wouldn‚Äôt deliver for a few weeks. It‚Äôs months later now and that person and I have had several conversations on messenger but now it randomly won‚Äôt let me send a simple ‚Äúhey‚Äù because it won‚Äôt deliver. I sent it on November 28, and now it‚Äôs December 5 and it still hasn‚Äôt delivered
Susita
These people have now pushed ads into messenger..
The App keeps "refreshing" every 5 seconds and nothing ever happens. Messages aren't going and connection through.
I love Messenger! I can talk to almost anyone privately. Written or orally. Send pictures and videos! Absolutely LOVE it!
'Messenger' makes it much easier to get a hold of some people that you could never ' get a hold of ' by regular cell or land lines. As it's title says, you can send messages also.  This app is an amazing medium for 'non- verbal communication with the emoji & numerous other pictures/ with short-to-the-point phrases like " I Love You " , or " where are you?"  So thank you, & as we know, you'll keep improving & updating this fine  app.. Aloha from Hawa-i'i. üå∫üåøüå∏‚òòÔ∏èüçÅüåøüåºüå¥üçÄüåè‚òòÔ∏èüíêüçÄüåà‚≠êÔ∏èüåô
I told FB I believe someone hacked my Messenger several times. Now whatever happened I can no longer get in at all. No straight answer from them at all. Or possibility of helping me. Now things have been taken over my Instagram too. I do not believe Messenger is that private. And I have no safe place to even tell my friends this has happened. I am not even going to give it a star at this point. Hopefully I will get the change to do so soon.
I use this app several times throughout my day. Easy to use and I have not had any problems with this app!
I think you should be able to delete pictures when you view them all. The way it works now, one has to scroll through the messages to get to that picture that he wants deleted. Let's simply this process by making it accessible when viewing all the photos.
I absolutely love messenger!
Still waiting to have the delete or archive feature back on the mobile app... instead of trying to be SNAPCHAT, you might want to work on features that matters to your users... Wishing somebody at your team read reviews. 
Hands down worst app I have on my phone. Every few days the app says it‚Äôs connecting or there‚Äôs no Internet connection when here I am leaving a review, ONLINE. I‚Äôve turned on/off my phone to fix it, erased and re installed the app etc etc and nothing. It will just start working when it feels like it. I hate this app.
One of the things I dislike about messenger is that once you‚Äôve read the message the notification doesn‚Äôt always go away.  You have to keep going to ‚ÄúHome‚Äù to get the notification to turn off.  I delete the app at times, because it is annoying when the notification won‚Äôt go away once you‚Äôve read the message.  Hope that is something that can be fixed on your end. 
This is my go-to app to message family and friends that are abroad. This morning I tried to send a message to one of these people but got a message saying I was blocked from sending messages because I had abused it in some way. However, I hadn‚Äôt sent one single message that morning yet. I am confused as to why this happened and wasn‚Äôt able to talk to my friends and family before they went to sleep. Very disappointed as i talk to them everyday and shouldn‚Äôt be regarded as spam or unwanted in any way.
I hate this freaking app. Tired of all of the annoying messages sent from followers. Please add an automatic reply to tell senders for users who choose not accept inbox messages.
Helps me keep up with friends on xbox ! Does however need improvement since this app is linked to facebook & my account has been blocked where this app isn't working I‚Äôve try'd signing in with just my phone number and it still doesn't work , maybe if facebook team would get off their high horse üêé & have an actual costumer service number to call this issue would be solved.
Do I need a separate messaging app to talk to my Facebook friends? And... if I truly do (I don't) why can't it just be simple and not try to be the next Snapchat? It doesn't crash (much) so I give it two stars but it's unnecessary and a pain.  Just another distraction. 
It won‚Äôt let me delete my messages. Please fix this issue. Update, it started working properly again.
i'll never understand why a secondary app is needed for fb messages. just.. keep it inside the fb app? 0/10, try again
That option is always on & off w/ this app. People can see when I was last active on messenger & I kinda like it when it doesn‚Äôt say that. But mostly, that option is never even there.
I click to view messages when it says there is a message- there isn‚Äôt one. I read all the messages.
I hate that it‚Äôs only the one sound. I‚Äôll be standing with my friends who all use this app and one of our phones will go off and we all have to pull out our phones to see who‚Äôs it was!
Facebook strikes again. Advertisements right in your message listing. No way to search or categorize messages. Messages get lost. Messages are not saved if you get kicked off mid way through writing. Totally worthless email program.
For being a massive company this app really peeves you off. Why does it NOTIFY you that you need to turn on notifications???
This new messenger is difficult to delete all conversation you have to download something in google b4 you can delete all the messages
Needs more stuff for the editing photos; also time for some newer ' find a face' options perhaps?? Maybe also make it easier to find and post my pictures on  my day.Messenger should make it to actually show up like other contacts doif y'all know where's i'm going with this??....
Everything was fine until this automatic update.  W t f.
This is how I keep in touch with family stationed overseas and it not sending messages or receiving them.
Man can y‚Äôall please hurry up and fix messenger my messages not sending or popping up !
my whole messenger stopped working and i‚Äôve tried to uninstall and try again still didn‚Äôt work.
The messenger app got updated but when I send a message it never sends to them I can only talk to people when I create a secret conversation I‚Äôm scared cuz messenger is the only way I can talk and contact most of the people near and dear to me if u can fix this plz do so immediately I can‚Äôt send or receive messages and it‚Äôs really annoying cuz I just wanna talk to the ones I care about but I can‚Äôt
New update for iPhone X does not work. I understand the update process to make things better but this time around u guys really messed upü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è All the convos have disappeared and now sending messages doesn‚Äôt work. Do we have to wait another 2 weeks for an update üòê Wish I could go back to older version that was stable .. Most of the time this program is solid! What happened ?
Fix messenger so it stop crashing I have ppl to text
There‚Äôs something with the updated version, my messages won‚Äôt send and when downloaded the app again it deleted every single messages I had. Please fix it!!!
Now you can‚Äôt delete messages!
I can no longer send any messages because they won‚Äôt deliver and people I‚Äôm not friends with on fb I can‚Äôt even message. It just fails
Messenger just did an update and now my messages aren‚Äôt going through. Ummmm did you test this update before you rolled it out? Please fix ASAP
its not working.
Thanks for updating my app and now it doesn‚Äôt work at all üñïüèø
Can't send messages in or out!! What the hell is going on?? Doesn't even show a list of previous messages everything is gone!
Won‚Äôt let me text message in Facebook idk what the hell is wrong but I‚Äôm scared my page gonna get deleted
I use this app everyday but everytime I tried using it today it has not worked at all i un downloaded it and re downloaded it but its still not working
Is there a reason your not working at all
It‚Äôs 12/5/17... your last update completely screwed up the app. No messages for anyone are going thru. Plz fix
What's happening?!  Doesn't work... don't load the messages!  can't write messages either üôÑ 
There is a bug with the latest update my messages aren‚Äôt going through and I have perfect connection so it‚Äôs an issue with the app
I cant believe. You recommended me to use it. But this app just always crashes. Fix it!!!!
With the newest update you guys did you can‚Äôt load the messages or send one.. fix this some of us rely on this for home businesses.
I cant send any messages and i cant even read any of my past messages what is this? Please fix
The app updated last night. Now it will not deliver or receive any messages.
This application is decent at times, and that‚Äôs putting it nicely. Today for example this application will not load my messages for some unknown reason. I have shutdown my phone and restarted it. I‚Äôve deleted both the Facebook and Messenger apps. Then reinstalling them both each respectively. The application also takes to much data, and space (IMO). Facebook Messenger needs a massive overhaul with more thought put into it.
Since update last night nothing will load up!
Since yesterday‚Äôs update, I can‚Äôt see my messages. What‚Äôs the point?
Forced update...completed it. Now I have no messages or the ability to send messages! Of course you force us to only use messenger. So now the important message I am waiting on a response from is gone!! Thanks a lot Facebook! #trash!!
I can‚Äôt see anything in my messenger... the thing that I can only see is the my day of my friends that‚Äôs all...
It‚Äôs bugged. Please fix it right away.
The newest update that happened on December 4th messed something up. After the update, none of my messages will send, they say they are sending but they don‚Äôt. All of my friends are having the same problem. My other social media‚Äôs and messaging apps work just fine, it‚Äôs only Facebook. Please fix this ASAP
My old messages won‚Äôt load and I can‚Äôt talk to anyone nothing works
Since the new update my old messages that I had are now not showing. Please fix.
The app won‚Äôt allow me to send some videos or pictures. It just has the sending bubble next to them, but they never deliver. Please fix this.
Can not send or receive anything üò§
In the last update the app doesn‚Äôt want to work anymore. I deleted the app expecting all my conversations to be there and they weren‚Äôt there. Along with that none of the messages were sending.
All my messages on my messenger they font show it only shows that there are no messages while i havent used my messenger as i was not connected with internet. And when i start to find a connection and went to see my messenger it appeared i had no messages. Even at another account i have it shows the same thing which that other account i havent used it for so long. I open it also from browser the same thing. If you can fix it it would be great.
All the updates just make it worse!!! It went to barely working to not working at all!! Won‚Äôt send any messages!!! Annoying when you have to speak to people who you would rather not have your actual number. Fix this!! ü§¨
I have trouble to load my messages then i delected. And when im installed i couldnt load my old messages and couldnt text to anyone
Broken can‚Äôt send messages
The new update just messes everything up. I cant send messages. It kept saying cNt load messGes even if i have a good internet connection bcz i can access other app without problems except this one

It says, "Waiting to send." What is wrong with this app? Too many glitches!!!
After this new update I literally cannot do anything on messenger. I‚Äôve deleted the app twice and reinstalled, restarted my phone several times, and logged out of Facebook and messenger completely. Nothing has worked.
Thanks for the update.  App doesn‚Äôt seem to want to load messages.  I can access stuff like PayPal and games, though.
Can‚Äôt load messages
Ever since I updated nothing is sending or receiving
I got a new phone and downloaded all the apps again. It works well until all of a sudden I can‚Äôt send messages using the apps and even on the computer. It says chat is down. My friends fb messenger don‚Äôt have any problem. I tried to removed the apps again and downloaded a new phone. What seems to be the problem? It‚Äôs the first time.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love the app but today my messages have stopped sending. I have asked my fellow Facebook friends if they have the same issue and they do. I‚Äôve tried redownloading but still nothing will fix the issue.
Mine is not working since the update this am
Messages said sent, but still have the check in the hollow circle indicating it wasn‚Äôt. Right after the latest update.
The only thing im having a problem with is its not working at allll. And especially when i calll someone i cant hear them berely.
my messages are not loading now. this update is now making that problem
The only thing tht appears when I open the app is who‚Äôs online my messages doesn‚Äôt show up it‚Äôs only a big blank white spot where it shows the entire list of messages
Hey decelopers, since the iOS 11.2 update. iOS introduced the stupid one-handed keyboard, and when I trying to switch keyboard from Text to emoji by long holding the ‚Äúswitch keyboard‚Äù button and jump to emoji,(pattern of an little earth on the lower left hand side next to space bar),  the emoji keyboard is slightly larger than the regular (US) keyboard so that my text window will be covered.   This is extremely inconvenient for me to text and editing. Please fix this!  Poor app.  Now I can‚Äôt even load mesg. 
Just updated this app and now it doesn't work at all. Cannot send or receive messages. Please fix asap
Now a days Messenger is crashing often and app isnt running smoothly. Sometimes message gets hidden and sometimes we cant even send or recieve message. This issue must be fixed as soon as possible. THANKYUU 
i dont see ALL MY MESSAGES
Used messenger all the time. Updated it and now I can‚Äôt send a message or load messages.
I just updated this app today and I can‚Äôt load any old messages :/ can you guys please fix this thanks üôèüèº
The new update causes messages not to be able to send.
Not letting me send my messages, not loading any of my messages im highly angrt
Ever sense the most recent update, my messenger isn‚Äôt working at all. My messages won‚Äôt send, it lost all of my past messages, and it‚Äôs making my phone glitch like crazy.
I just updated the messenger and surprise surprise, it is not working. Why keep updating it if its not broken?! I have important messages I cannot even read now. I had already uninstalled it and reinstalled it and nothing!!!
Now none of my messages are sending and I‚Äôm not able to receive any messages. It‚Äôs not only me it‚Äôs happening to either. Please fix
Soooo after the update yesterday I can‚Äôt message anyone or receive messages I can‚Äôt see who‚Äôs online I can‚Äôt see any of my messages or anything fix this problem please
I get a message where I ‚Äúcannot load messages‚Äù but I am unable to delete the conversation!
So I updated the app today and apparently with the update erased every conversation I‚Äôve had with anybody out of my phone I have conversations on that I will never get back
This is the third or fourth time...seriously
My app updated over night and now will not load anything! This needs to be fixed immediately as messenger is the only way I have to contact some family.
Messages aren‚Äôt going through and now won‚Äôt load. I had to pick a star rating. I‚Äôd give ZERO because it‚Äôs not working at all.
I CANT GET OR RECEIVE ANYTHING...
Messages aren‚Äôt sending with the new update.
This messenger app doesn‚Äôt serve its purpose since I can no longer message people. Its not my phone but it gets stuck on sending messages. This pretty much ruined my morning since my whole family started getting frustrated, thanks Facebook :)
It‚Äôs a great app at times... I can‚Äôt get into rn and it deleted all my messages and won‚Äôt let me send any.... 
Messenger is not working on my phone I can‚Äôt send messages and I can‚Äôt receive messages ... please fix ASAP thank you üôÉ
Can‚Äôt See My Messages
I deleted the app and re installed it but still doing the same thing, was working just fine till I updated.
This is the first time I am having issues with messenger! On my Iphone 6s Plus, I have a ton of messages saved. Now they ALL disappeared & just shows a red bar saying 'Cannot Load Messages'. This is very upsetting. Especially with the fact I have messages that go all the way back to 2007!
You updated it and now it won‚Äôt work on my iPhone! Not happy about this!!
This app has way to many issues. Ever since the iPhone update my app keeps crashing, now my messages aren‚Äôt going through. The volume on the video chat is low, so I have to use headphones. The app freezes up while you‚Äôre using it. Too many issues and I‚Äôm over it
Messenger really bad  No msg have been displayed 
This latest update is horrible. Completely shuts down and does not send messages. Fix it!
The previous message won‚Äôt load I can‚Äôt view any ones day
I just updated to the latest version of the app and once I opened the app, all my messages were gone and it said it couldn‚Äôt load my conversations. I deleted and reinstalled the app but still no messages would pop out. Please fix this. Thanks
Ever since your update about 22 hours ago I can‚Äôt use the damned app. It crashes or it says ‚Äúcant load conversations‚Äù this is ridiculous. Updates should make it better not WORSE
I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on with the app,but all of a sudden after the update my messages are stupid and keep showing in error when I send a message!!! Please fix it asap
This update appears to have broken the app. Can‚Äôt post in our group message or change notifications. Won‚Äôt even load on a computer. Fix it don‚Äôt make it worse.
I updated dated my Facebook Messenger app today. I can‚Äôt delete messages or send/receive anything. I‚Äôve tried deleting and reinstalling it, did nothing. So I‚Äôm deleting the app for now till it‚Äôs fixed. So please get on it Devs, thank you.
Can't see none of my messages, as if it all by deleted. I just updated it too. Please fix
Are you kidding me? Glitches upon glitches!! And you know what's the worse problem? You are forced to use this app in order to message on Facebook! Here's a big middle finger to anyone who thought this was ok!
I can‚Äôt even get in it to see all the message. It so annoying, I tried to reset my phone and try to reset the app but nothing work. Please fix this problem because this is ridiculous, ever since the new update on messenger it screwed up the whole app. Fix the problem or you‚Äôll have one less user to worry about. It still going on and ever since the recent one, it screwed up again. I‚Äôm about done with Facebook.
Bcz messages are unable to load!! There is so much problem
Why the massenger doesn‚Äôt show massages ?
i cant text anyone. my messages will not load nor send. it is not my wifi or data this is the only app doing this PLEASE FIX IMMEDIATELY
my app updated itself today and now it wont let me read my messages?
I've tried to use the app to ask my classmates about the assignment and quizzes for the next day. When I try to send something it would say "sent" but about one second later, it says "sending..." Like it annoying and my phone keeps vibrating because about the send problem.
Facebook messenger is the worst app ever cause when you go in the app it doesn‚Äôt show your messages and it won‚Äôt let you send messages it just shows you a white screen
So I updated the app and its awful. The screen is blank , all of my previous messages are gone, I can't text anyone ,the text are not being posted , my internet is doing just fine I double checked it. Please fix.
I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on here, why can‚Äôt I find my photos which I sent and received from my friends. Please READ THIS REVIEW and find out what‚Äôs wrong here and don‚Äôt make my review wasted.  ‚ÄòCause I really need to find some pictures in this app.  Please, fix it as soon as possible. THANK YOU.  Okay. First of all, things are still happening as I‚Äôve written above, second of all, the app sent me notification that there‚Äôs someone sending me a message. But when I open the app, there was nothing. 
I was talking to my friend then it hung up on us so I went 2 message them and after that it kept saying it was still sending but kept making the send sound over and over again so I deleted the app reinstalled it and now it won‚Äôt let me see any messages I ever had it says couldn‚Äôt load these messages or whatever and it‚Äôs really pissing me off I can‚Äôt talk to ppl anymore
This is ridiculous. Several updates of this app now have failed to fix the 180¬∞ screen flip issue, the touch screen inaccuracies, the ridiculous autocorrects, the highlighting selection problem and the infuriating failure of the screen to follow typing below the initial 2-line horizon. I've wanted to throw my phone across a room repeatedly while using this frustrating and poorly functioning app, and will simply stop using it. There are several alternative messengers available that use the same contact list and are much more stable. Why continue to bloat and add extra frills to this crap app when the basics of still don't work?
Where is the chat bubble on iOS? It‚Äôs there on Android but not iOS.
Why does this exist? I can't even check messages on my browser anymore, it's a horrible model to need 3 apps for one service, not to mention being bothered with 7 (yes I've counted) pop up questions when you download it,  no I don't want to turn notifications on, don't ask me 4 times after I declined the first time.
You force people to retrieve messages through this app that has never worked properly. What a waste of time and energy. Useless!
However, you never get 5 stars in review. What's a point?
Honestly it would be acceptable if there was an option to change the notification sound. The ding sound is so obnoxious I actually get mad whenever i hear it.
It won‚Äôt even let me open the app to read a message. Keeps shutting me out when I click on a message.
Waste of time & poor service  Ur knowledgeable staff need to be given room to grow on this amazing technological time  Wake up & make us want to use ur service Respectfully submitted 
Convenient and sooooo easy to use!
It would be nice if you could fix the feature on the I watch because right now it‚Äôs blank!
It's kind of disgusting that you've injected ads into the conversations list.
Separate app not tied in well into main app. Sending messages needlessly complicated and slow. About to delete as well.
I miss the old messenger! Everytime someone messages me now I have to leave whatever app I‚Äôm on and physically go to messenger.
This app is one of the most pushy things I have ever downloaded. No, I don‚Äôt want push notifications. And the fact that they have a pop up EVERY SINGLE TIME I GET ON THE APP IS ANNOYING. I‚Äôm done with this app. And randomly, when the app was completely closed, it asked for access to my camera. Pushy AND suspicious. Super disappointed in this app and Facebook. 
Too sloww don't work properly always take forever to open da app. And yea MB is too high mke it reduce. Need more work fastüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ
Before when ever i what to see the groups in chat i could see the names who seen the messages now its just a picture  I couldnt really know precisely who seen it to be able to find out in our group chat that didnt participate of didnt read what our messages for the group 
It by far is using the most battery out of any app on my phone and I don‚Äôt even use it. I heard Android had a problem like this back in January.  If you have an iPhone X do not get this app.
Such a terrible app. Can‚Äôt even log out of my bs account
Facebook, pull your Kimmy Schmidt together. This is ridiculous. I hate how slow it takes to switch from one app to the other. Usually the memory required means the Facebook app closes so when I go back I lose wherever I was in Facebook and have to start over.
This app has slowly fallen apart over the course of the past three months. Now even Facebook‚Äôs emojis don‚Äôt show up.
I play huuuge everyday & today all day it has let me open the app but as soon as I do it closes out & puts me on my home screen! I‚Äôve spent my $ on this app & it won‚Äôt let me play it now?? I‚Äôm getting really angry about it! I just bought a package two days ago & I can‚Äôt even use it. How do you fix this???
ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≥ŸÜÿ¨ÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿØŸäÿØ ÿ≥Ÿä ÿ¨ÿØÿß ŸàŸÖÿ¥ ÿ¥ÿ∫ŸÑ ŸÉŸàŸäÿ≥ ŸÑŸÖŸá ÿ≠ÿØ Ÿäÿ™ÿµŸÑ ÿπŸÑŸäŸÉ ŸàÿπŸÑŸä ÿßŸÑÿßŸäŸÅŸàŸÜ
There should be a way to search for specifically media, links or attachments in the chats like in Whatsapp. It would improve the search and help finding much more useful info than keywords.
More often than not Messenger shows that I have a message but tells me the message is unable to load. I knew when the system started forcing me to go through the Messenger app instead of reading messages from my Facebook page it could only mean bad things. I told me so!
I‚Äôve had my phone for a few weeks now and still cannot connect to Facebook Messenger? Is there a glitch?
No point to have a separate app!!!
Is there anything you can do about a hovering 2 on the app that won‚Äôt go away. It is an eyesore.
Super inconvenient, especially when the notification pops up just because you made a new Facebook friend. Also when your iPhone storage is limited. Everything should be confined to one app. Easier to use that way.
I hate Facebook for making me download this. I rarely use Facebook or need to message any one through it, but when I do, I can only do so through this app. The fact that I can‚Äôt just reply through my web browser makes me mad. I don‚Äôt want to be forced into downloading this.
Forced to install this stupid app
The app does not show any profile picture of groups or ppl or people I am talking too and the app takes forever to load
Ok, when I do the Tapback response like heart face, laugh face, thumbs up/down, why do I have to see that ridiculous animation and not be able to move on? The person who should see the animation is the one recieving it only if they have the setting on saying that they want to freaking see it ... I‚Äôm livid that logic was not used in the coding of this copycat feature üò°  Also, how am I supposed to know who is messaging me when I can‚Äôt look at my phone? There needs to be Siri support, and also needs support for changing the notification sound for people and groups!!!!! 
Within the app, there will ALWAYS be a little red badge with a 1 in it in the corner. It‚Äôs an in app notification. It makes you think you have a message. And when you click it (it‚Äôs always visible and it‚Äôs instinctive to click to make it go away) the notification is this exactly: ‚ÄúTurn On Notifications.‚Äù  Screw this app. Screw Facebook for blatantly disregarding choice and customer opinion. For DEMANDING to be the center of attention in a world already so full of distractions we can‚Äôt see straight. Just for the possibility of a tiny amount of profit.  It‚Äôs obnoxious to begin with that Facebook demands you have a separate app to use fb messages. The reason is they want to compete with or take the place of your texting app. It‚Äôs all about profit. Blatant disregard for the customer.  The thing is you don‚Äôt care. You don‚Äôt have to. You‚Äôll probably slap a copy pasted ‚Äúwe‚Äôre sorry for your disappointment please contact customer service and we will try to make it better‚Äù as a response to this.  You know what? You won‚Äôt even do that Facebook. You don‚Äôt have to. You‚Äôve abandoned all illusion of caring about anyone using the app. You‚Äôve got a complete monopoly on of the greatest mediums of communication the world has ever seen. It‚Äôs value is comprised by the number of people on it. It cannot be competed with. The only solution is making it a utility, run by the people for the people. And one day the people will come together to replace Facebook with something community run and built. Because we don‚Äôt need you. We made you and we can destroy you just as easily. Until then, screw off facebook. Screw off. 
I was HACKED IN MESSENGER! I have deleted it out of my account.
I wish you would create the chat heads or the chat bubbles on ios devices
I am using iPhone X. And whenever I use an emoji and then go back to typing letters, the suggested words will cover the space where I am typing. It doesn‚Äôt adjust back! And it‚Äôs so annoying. I have to close it and then open it again then it will be normal. This is the only app that have this annoying bug!
Y'all need to add the chat bubbles on the iPhone version. That's the one thing I miss about my android.
I detest this "feature". Why switch to a completely separate app? Which doesn't even open without having to first visit App Store (even when already downloaded). I absolutely hate it. AND, it‚Äôs slow to load, cluttered, and not user friendly
And now it looks like I no longer have an archive for messages I don‚Äôt want to see in my inbox. My only choices with Messages are copy, delete, or forward. Good job Facebook, it worked fine, and now you fixed something that really didn‚Äôt need fixing. I award you zero points, and may God have mercy on your soul
I am so over this app. Deleted.
Pls add volume controls to be able to watch/listen other video/audio apps. I would like to be able to watch and actually clearly hear a video that it sent to me or in another app without having to hang up the Messenger video chat.  Messenger has a mute option but it only mutes the mic audio. It does not mute the sound from the video chat. It would be great if you can mute the sound or lower the volume of the video chat so you don‚Äôt have to hang up the Messenger call. 
I‚Äôm missing the call button on the group chat. Can‚Äôt log out of messenger and there‚Äôs a lot more I have a an iPhone 8 I just got today nd my iPhone 6 has all of that so what‚Äôs the problem I upgrade and loose more ???
This messenger leaves your Facebook open to getting hacked on the daily. I had to change my password almost everyday due to funky stuff. Should have just left the message combined in the Facebook app.
This app impedes communication.  When I have it installed, it‚Äôs intrusive and superfluous.  I can be reached easily through FB posts and regular texts.  When I delete it to avoid the hassles, people assume I have it and they don‚Äôt get responses.  If FB HAS to have it, an automated response should be generated:  Please access me through a regular post, or go to my web site for contact info.  What a disservice this is! 
please bring back the option where you can select a specific message in a convo. its hard to like click delete click delete per message.thanks
This app is complete and utter trash! There are way too many glitches! I can even view anyone‚Äôs day on there! Fix this app!
I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have to download an app to check my inbox, very annoying!
Do not run ads in messenger. It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous.
None of my actual messages or threads show up in the app. If I can‚Äôt access messages through the mobile site or the messenger app what‚Äôs the point of even using Facebook for messages?
Look. I don‚Äôt know what the deal is, but I‚Äôm tired of seeing the little ‚Äú1‚Äù notifying me of a message AND THERE ISN'T ONE. seriously, it irritates the mess outta me and fix it. Thanks.
The app recently decided it can‚Äôt count . It says I have 18 messages but I have way more than that and just a few hours ago it said I had 19 . It keeps switching the number back and fourth between those and another thing is when I have a message request I will check it and it will still be there. I will deny it and it will still be there ! And then disappear and then come back ! VERY annoying !
Irritating that you can‚Äôt adjust the volume on your call when it‚Äôs too loud on your end. Needs to be fixed!
Can we get the ability to delete conversations.... there are viruses starting to circle through messenger and there is no way to get rid of the links when a friend‚Äôs account has been hacked
I love the app but I need an easier and quicker way to delete multiple messages. Can u swipe a message then have the delete option? Works wonders in GMAIL. Give it some thought.
I have notifications on, but i am not getting any, so when i open the app i have messages that were sent to me a while ago. But i didn‚Äôt notice due to no notifications appearing, i have the Noise and Lock Screen appearance thing. Still no noticiations, please fix.
I am a big fan of messenger but when ever I go to make a video call neither people on the video call can hear each other and most times it doesn‚Äôt want to connect although the WiFi is fine if you guys can look into this problem it would be great thank you.
Please find a way to delete ALL messages st once!!!!!!
I was forced to install this app to view any FB messages and forced to turn on notifications. I would give zero star if possible because I do not want this app.
With all of the resources that Facebook has, you would think this app would be better. Sometimes if I haven‚Äôt opened the app in a while, it doesn‚Äôt alert me when I get a message. It often doesn‚Äôt send the messages when I‚Äôm replying from the lock screen. Also with iOS 11, Touch ID sometimes no longer works from the lock screen for this app only. I would strongly prefer to use another messaging app but this is what my friends use so I‚Äôm stuck with it.
Scammy app
I had someone new send me a message and even though it shows me I read it, I still have one ‚Äúunread‚Äù message. I went through and opened every single conversation with people and it still shows I have one unread message from the new person I got the message from... I‚Äôve read it and even replied and we are carrying on a conversation, but now whenever one person messages me, it says I still have the unread message from that other person and the false notification is driving me nuts. Please fix ASAP!
What is going on with this app? It used to work flawlessly. Now after a few updates when I go in voice massages are spinning and I have to type something before they stop. This happens on both WiFi and when I am on my cellular network. So it is not a network issue. You really need to add a feature where a user can email the developers. Having to leave a review when you have a problem is lame. I like the app but the are issues that hat need to be addressed. Sometimes lately I don‚Äôt get notifications when I‚Äôm not on the app. Very annoying when you are having a serious conversation and things need to be addressed. I use messenger because of the features versus the text message on my phone. Messenger has much better photo capabilities and much better gifs. Please fix the issue I have addressed here. Thank you
so many ads
Really enjoy it
You used to be able to delete messages by swiping right. Then it was you had to hold down and delete. But now every time I hold down to delete a message, it opens the message up then asks if I want to delete. Sometimes I just don‚Äôt want that message opened, I just want to delete it. It would be greatly appreciate (and I don‚Äôt believe I am alone) if you would bring back the swipe right delete. Thank you.  Update 3DEC17: there are now ads in messenger. 
Since,we all know that there is a new update of giving stories on messanger,like snapchat,Instagram and/or other social networking sites!The problem with my app is that ,it‚Äôs not getting updated to it‚Äôs latest!
bring back the option to sign out of messenger. this is ridiculous. If I decide to deactivate my facebook I don‚Äôt want to keep messenger either. üôÑ
Sooo annoying that my messages to certain people who aren‚Äôt friends are always ‚Äúsent‚Äù and it takes sometimes WEEKS or months for it to show me that the message was ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù!!! This thing about the recipient needing to ‚Äúaccept the message request‚Äù be

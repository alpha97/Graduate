Hola cómo soy goran  Voy el muy bien 
A great app for listening to the music that you like
Best app ever and free!
Pandora is amazing. But NEEDS the subscription plans to be available on Google Home, Entune for the car, Apple TV, needs a family plan, etc. They have the app there, but can't use your paid subscription. THEN I will subscribe. But NO ONE beats Pandora in regards to song selections. Smart.
Love my pandora app!!!
Love this app!
Stuff
It’s getting hard to keep my Pandora account active when a YouTube subscription is the same price and I can download the songs that Pandora doesn’t have due to “Licensing Restrictions.”
I have all my music set to explicit music and pandora still sensors my songs
You guys need to cut back on the ads played. It is ridiculous when there is an every two songs. Pandora premium is so pricy that it is not worth it. Work on making your app better for us all. Ads are taking over everything. Look around Facebook and the internet. Please take this into consideration
I use to love pandora, now every time I try to use the app it won’t even load, it’ll stay stuck on the P for the longest time. I’ve tried deleting and redownloading it but it does nothing. I’m dissapointed 🙁
Desperately needs a UI refresh and landscape landscape landscape!!! It would be nice to use Pandora in landscape position. What ever Pandora uses to select songs also needs an update!
Muy bueno
The music genome project is highly intelligent and feeds me the music I want to hear based on Artist usually and sometimes genre
Okay, so I love pandora, but I accidentally subscribed. How it happened was I accidentally pressed “upgrade” instead of “cancel” when something popped up. I hadn’t realized I pressed upgrade, and was exiting out of the pandora app. My thumb was on the home button. Well, as it turns out, I paid for premium pandora when accidentally using my thump print passcode. So...yeah I was disappointed that I couldn’t get my money back when hitting cancel subscription, and my parents were mad. :/
Lost signal much
Excelent!
Love the variety that can be listened to. You can go from old country to hard rock. Love it
Thank you Pandora! Always enjoy your company! :-)

OMG, This thing is just so good you get music on the go with hardly any lag and when you buy pandora plus, no ads and offline mode so no data is used and lag is non existent.
The best
Almost accidentally upgrade. Feel like it's almost a set up so people will upgrade perhaps unknowingly and Pandora reaps the benefits of innocent music listeners.
I only use Pandora. I’m aware of other services. I used to enjoy Sirius with my TV provider as it has unique content, but Pandora is great. I’d be playing hip hop songs in the hood before anyone here was aware. The Punk and Rock selection is great. The mix on channels is great.
Just give me a clear thought while I’m hustling to make your money
Free unlimited quality music from any genre and great for introducing new music. 2 thumbs up
So I was forced to download you new and improved app. Naturally nothing works now!
I really LOVE pandora it helps me chill out
I like pandora because I can listen to the songs I want and skip the songs I don't want to listen to I can choose my own playlists and I can choose my own station
Damm😃😃😃😃😃😃😃
Used for the first time in months and soon realized why I had stopped using. Played a 30 second ad between every song. Some ads are “bearable” but there were just too many.
Love Pandora!
I like this app but it would be better if u didn’t have to whatch so many ads
Pandora is amazing. I love their new update. It is so helpful that I don’t have a playlist I have a mixture of songs.
It’s the worst app ever stop making it!!!!!!!
I love pandora. It helps me get through the day.
Everything ok
A year of Pandora was a Christmas gift and though I like it, I was very disappointed to find I can’t use it on vacation if it’s online.  I get a message that “Pandora is not available in this country.”  And the only way I know to go offline is to be online first. So, no music on vacation. Bummer.
All in all, I dislike Pandora Premium. I found it slow to load and buffer songs and search function wasn’t great. It’s ok if you know exactly what you are looking for but sometimes you might not know how to spell or the full song title and Pandora suggestions weren’t very good. The most annoying feature is the manner in which it buffers on my phone when I’m driving. If my phone grabs a wireless network while I’m on the go, it will switch off the song and the app will basically stop responding to any taps I make. This never happens with either Spotify or iTunes.  Also, playlists are too rudimentary: your favorites basically become one long playlist. I want the ability to create several of my own...  Save your money - stick with the free service as it’s more than adequate for what it is. Premium is NOT worth the $$.   One last gripe: you can only cancel on a laptop or desktop computer. It won’t let you access subscription (unless you want to add) via mobile or tablet device - couldn’t cancel via my iPhone or iPad. Pandora got an extra two months of payment from me because I don’t have regular access to a computer where I can log in to a music service. Buyer beware!!!!!!! So shady!!! 
I love it!
I’ve been with pandora since it was a mere website. I use it all day everyday. In the car, work, shower. Love my personals radio and the new thumbprint radio! 
Whenever I want to create a channel based off a song title it asks me if I want pandora premium and I don’t I just want a channel based off of a specific song
hate that the same song are put over and over if I am hearing the music for a long period of time.
I listen morning,noon,and night I love it.Easy for you to make playlist yes!!!
I love pandora, it plays all he right songs at the right time
Great
I just listening to Pandora all the time especially with with the different stations.  In with Pandora in Zachary.
The best
I understand that to use the free pandora app you have to have ads. When I began using pandora it was awesome. Every 4-5 songs you had a 30 second add, tolerable and understandable. After each “update” the ads became more frequent. Now, I hear an ad after every song, at the most 2 songs in a row. Plus, every other ad is for upgrading to premium. Your trying to force an upgrade by making it intolerable to listen to the free ap. All your doing is making me abandon pandora for another service.
Fan...tastic!!!
Aw some music
Great
What’s not to love about pandora?
I love this app is so great and I just love it
I pay for this and after couple songs it just stops till I cancel the app and restart it! And if I give feed back it locks up and I have to cancel the app and restart it! I about to cancel paying for this!!!!!
Been using plus for a long time, but getting tired of constantly hearing the same songs over and over.  I was also getting sick and tired of every 15 minutes seeing the recommendation to try premium. So I did, what the hell. Thought I could hear more original songs instead of the same 5 they always repeat, which I think is probably done on purpose. I was also stoked about being able to repeat the songs I like and add them to playlists, but guess what?  Already 5 times in the past hour have songs come up that I am unable to repeat or add to play lists due to licensing restrictions. So why advertise that ability when clearly it is false. Canceling pandora all together due to this.
This keeps happening. I have updated regularly and have no idea why the music starts playing with no input from me. Then I can’t clear it out because the app isn’t even open. I have to pause it from the lock screen. Fix it! Please! I can’t have my music start in the office.
The best I ever downloaded
Cannot cancel subscription not downgrade!
Thanks guys for fixing the bugs for this app so far. I’ve been using pandora for free  ever since I was a kid. I’m still using it and don’t have any problems with it. Keep up the great work. 👍🏼

Ever since the last update one week ago this app stopped working. It loads but won’t play. I deleted it and reinstalled and now won’t load at all.  I have a subscription.  But will cancel.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I accidentally got premium. But how do I get rid of it
So many adds... I get that you need them but come on it’s a little ridiculous!!
Love the ability to change things up throughout the day. From working out to casual listening
I like new rock music and it’s great to have this large variety to choose from. The custom stations are very nice. Thanks for this app 
I wish it would update more often. Not able to delete suggested interest.
Unless you have the subscription for pandora, you will only hear a few songs of the artist station you created.
The best personal radio/genre/ favorite wacky loves ever!!!
Love offline listening with pandora plus makes easier to travel with music playing
Excellent selections...I enjoy!
I am okay with commercials and everything but I am NOT okay with commercials in regards to adult products.  If you do not want to listen to commercials about sex products and and stuff in that nature then stay away from this app. 
Pandora continues to enrich my life with an essential element of quality living...great music! gc
Why can’t we skip more
Pandorosa is the best.
What else can you say.  Pandora premium is excellent.
I love pandora
For a few days I’ve been playing with what Pandora can really do. I’m impressed with the way that I can pick a channel and all the music is relevant to my generation and taste
Was very happy but getting frustrated due to continually crashing
What the hell! I have to pay...Um no! This app was okay but it just made me pay so no sorry not using again deleted. This was good until I had to pay sorry it’s not working good so deleting 😁going to re download if Spotify is “worse”. Edit: I’m very sorry 😰 Spotify is much worse re downloading please get fixed though.
What is the problem please let me know what is going on.
You need to expand your song selections
Pandora isnt working anymore. It just says station not available on EVERY station. I even tried reinstalling the app. 🤔
Love love love♥️♥️
Only thing that gets me thru the work day....
I\'ve been a very happy user of Pandora for years now, but suddenly the app won\'t open. Says it can\'t connect and there\'s no problem with my device or internet connection. This is very upsetting as I have a 6 year old daughter that one played a \"lullaby\" station during bath and getting ready for bed since she was a few weeks old. Suddenly not being able to access this is very upsetting and has totally thrown our routine off, which is a huge deal for a kid with autism. I have trusted this app for years and I\'ve never had a problem until the past few weeks. Zero access, no problem with my devices or internet connection, what gives??? I\'m not happy to have to try other streaming music apps all of a sudden.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble.

Great
The best way ton listen to music hands down!
I never entered any billing information or a tempted to purchase premium. When I open the app it asked me to complete a transaction which I did not initiate. I press the cancel button but the app submitted the transaction without my consent. Now I am struggling to get them to refund me the money that they stole.
Thanks Pandora for two price points  that you can enjoy offline music! Others charge much more & no option to download music without having premium for $10 a month. Music selection is excellent & love can listen on my Roku which I love the screen images that act as a screensaver. App is also very user friendly. Keep up the great work!!
Eye loves yoooou
I really enjoy the wide variety of music!!!
I have bought ove 500 app since my first iPhone, and this is the only bad review I have ever make. This app doesn’t want to start and when it does it change the songs in the middle of the one that is playing. It constantly ask me to buy the premium and some time when I press no thanks it ask for my finger print to confirm the purchase, and before you guys think is my phone. It does that on my iPad and my previous phone.
Pandora really does cheat people out their money don’t try a free subscription of premium cause then you’re going to have to pay for it then after you pay it and cancel the subscription you’re going to have to pay for it again not worth it don’t get the app waste of time but I would recommend "Spotify" it’s great!!!
Need a replay button and a history.
I do not know the reason why, but since the update my Pandora app won’t even open!! It just shows the loading screen and then after a few minutes it says it can’t connect to my network or WiFi. But other apps work just fine on WiFi. Not sure why it’s glitching but it’s very frustrating  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Far too many ads. They used to have about 10 skips per hour per station no matter how many stations you click on. Now it is only about 1- 2 if that. On stations that I haven’t been on in over a year will have no skips on it and it’s ridiculous.They also have ads that will interrupt a song. Many times as I’m listening to Pandora I have to exit the app and restart it just to get some of the ads to go away. Also what the heck pandora? Do you really think you’re going to get more customers by playing ads that are over a minute long as soon as you click on a station? No wonder so many more people use Spotify
I love ❤️🦄😘 it
I love pandora but it’s become pretty repetitive by playing too many ads after like only 1-2 songs are played or skipped. Also I noticed they sometimes don’t play the right songs on a specific channel? Like they’ll play 90s songs on an 80s channel and vice versa. Either way I’m just tired of the lack of variety on some stations as if 10 bands existed in a whole decade. Not to mention way too many ads like every few songs..(30 second ads too, not 5-10 second ones) :/
It sounds like a number one hit tune.
it is good
I’ve been using Pandora for years and I absolutely love it. I discovered lots of music from this app.
Horrible customer service. Have been trying to contact in regards to my account for THREE months. No response in emails or reviews. For 3 months I have been charged for a service that I did not authorize and now can’t get ahold of anyone no matter the method of contact or device used. I’ve tried multiple desktops as well as my phone. Even had friends and family try to email Pandora with no response. Anyone else struggle like this? Absolutely livid.
Love pandora nothing else can be said
Good stuff!  I like several channels but John Williams keeps me alert at work!
I just wanted to use the basic paid version of this app. The app constantly harassed me to upgrade to premium. It would ask “Yes or later”. After months of this I thought that maybe it was an upgrade I had to do. It should have said “yes or NO”. “later” kept me in this mad cycle of harassment. So, I upgraded and was charged $12.99 a month. It didn’t say it would charge me more.
This is SUCH A GREAT APP!!!
Too many ads, other than that, everything is amazing!! Have found awesome new artists w/ Pandora
Biggest beef (and ive been a subscriber for yearrrs) is that 1) the genome plays the same songs over and over every day if u hv liked them instead of going more to songs similar - i dont want to hear the ones i like over and over everyday OR the same music chain every day.  i finally quit paying and am using my free Amazon music.  2) as a subscriber for about 7 years - NEVER offered a discount, even if paying a whole year, thats bad PR. And, at the free level 3) AD VOLUMES RIDICULOUSLY loud - which is why i purchased in the first place.  When they upgrade the app, many times troubles with it freezing up my phone too :( 
I have been using Pandora for years and have always enjoyed the service. With the new upgrades it is not user friendly. I have a hard time getting to play different music. I pay for the service for it to play downloaded music offline and it plays two songs then stops playing my shuffled downloaded music. I am very unhappy and they charging me $12.99 for a service that doesn’t work. They have made it difficult to end your account. You have to request and they still are charging my card. This “upgraded” Pandora has ruined my feelings toward pandora and I will be switching to a different music provider. 
I love Pandora, but the gag-worthy ad of a guy sneezing and coughing has GOT TO GO.  I exit the app every time it comes on because it is THAT nauseating.  Find a better way to advertise for whatever medical thing that is because it’s a HUGE turn off for me.  It’s like nails on a chalkboard.
Very good app!
I love this app so much😂❤️

It a great app
I’ve been a user for around 4 years now and I’ve had it. I get 2 ads for every 2 songs that come on and now completely closing out the app doesn’t skip. They drill ads at you until you’re FORCED to buy premium. I’m done with pandora.
I only want to listen to pandora
Pandora has had spurts of notoriety But as of late - it stinks!  Perhaps they’re aiming for your subscription-  SMH! There’s other music apps  Can’t connect anywhere- even in front of a router😡😡😡😡 
Though I love how well pandora knows my taste, I can’t stand how often it crashes!! Literally every time I have the app open it crashes within the first 3-5 songs. Once I reopen I end up hearing the same songs I’ve already heard and can’t skip past them without using all my skips  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

This is finally something that’s really easy. It’s a good music player. You can pick your stations, and honestly since I downloaded it I stopped yawing Spotify and Spotify is #1😳
This isn’t much of a review, I love Pandora. But if you play another Don Blankenship advertisement I will delete my account and remove the app from my phone. I’ve only heard it once, that’s all it takes to show how spineless you all are to allow such a corrupt creature buy an advertisement from you. It’s sick. And I refuse to keep listening if you support him. I can put up with a lot, but HE is not one of those things.
A general summary of Pandora: Something has gone wrong. Please try again. Something has gone wrong. Please try again. Something has gone wrong. Please try again. Literally everything I touch on this app brings up this Something has gone wrong. Please try again. notification. If I even look at it the wrong way, a Something has gone wrong. Please try again. notification pops up. Fun times. 
Great music
Pandora keeps me company all night at work. With great tunes, it’s 5 STARS !!!! I have it on when I’m at home doing work around the house. I have on when I need to tune the rest of the world OUT! Thank you !!!! 
Ever since I’ve upgraded to the premium service songs will cut off mid way & start a new song. Quite annoying. I guess there are some bugs that still need to be worked out. But if it continues I will have to discontinue my premium service & go with a competitor & hope I don’t have the same problems. And I never had this issue with the free service & I’m up to date on the app & IOS.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I canceled my paid membership due to the notification to upgrade to their even more premium subscription every single time I used the app. I emailed my complaint to Pandora and they basically told me to pack sand. I knew the first time you offered your premium subscription that I didn’t want to upgrade, and you lost a customer because you simply weren’t willing to add an option to disable that annoying notification. I’m currently giving Spotify a shot to impress me. So far so good. Also, the offline mode was never very good
Free music app, amazing
Thumbprint radio combines all my genres when I can’t decide what I’m in the mood for.  Then just as I begin to sing along, Pandora switches and suddenly I am rocking out to some Big Bang, Rat-pack,or inspired WWII songbirds. Take a breath and It’s Fire and Rainy Days and Monday’s, playing Gentle on my Mind rolling me through some good old country classic, which according to Suzy Boggus is Aces.!.!
I love it is the best of all
Pandora is the absolute best!
Not perfect, it tends to repeat songs. In addition if I choose one artist I expect to just listen to that artist.
Love every bit of it and ALL of you at PANDORA. THANK YOU. !!!!   Jeanette
I like it
I love pandora because it gives me the best songs. The songs I love come out and that’s all I want from a music app and I’m happy thank you.
Too many Commercials and when you do pay for the price just keeps going up & then they want you to keep paying more & more
I love pandora
I’m very disappointed in how much of the music selection is not available for download or repeat. A lot of my favorite songs I am unable to listen to on demand.
Beautiful!!!!
I hadn’t used Pandora since 2012, but decided to give it a shot after finding out that the music in a few of my favorite spots were all Pandora playlists.   Pandora’s analytics appear to be so much better than Spotify’s!! Maybe it needs better marketing. The one thing I would change is the way the advertising is integrated. 
Holy crap with the ads!
Please premium free
This app is a life saver. It is great for on the go and when I am doing work . Love it so much!!
This app is very great. It plays all the music you want. Only thing I personally don't think you should have to pay to browse songs. Other than that I love this app. I really recommend this app
Helps me find new songs all the time! Great for someone who likes a lot of different types of music.
Like it
I truly enjoy Pandora. It has never failed me. No matter what mood I desire to be in I can rely on Pandora to set the atmosphere just right for the occasion.
Pandora is the best! 🎶
I like Pandora a lot but there are times song come on I’ve never heard of they are not the ones I chose for sure. But other than enjoy free music 😎
Love this beautiful app

Listen I found something STUPID!!!!, so say I go on Demi Lvato station and I listen to one of her songs but , the song after that song IS NOT EVEN A DEMI LAVATO SONG!!!!!!!!!! Please help fix this because I want to ONLY listen to Kesha or ONLY Demi LAVATO  Ok ten weeks later that’s still not fixed but another thing I hate. I want old pandora back. The way it looks on the app is stupid I can do things easier how it used to be.  Four days later I came up with three words to describe pandora one frustrating two fun three stupidest 
This app drains my battery 50% in just a few hours. Ridiculous.
I love pandora it lets me listen to my music that gets me pumped and excited to start the day.
Always there for me......thanks!
It always can put me in a good mood!! My favorite!! Best Rock ever!
I wish that the app would let me know which one of my stations a song was playing in if it was for a specific kind of music only so I would know whether to thumbs down on it or not if I already had that song on another station. For example if made a station just to listen to a certain band and a song from ANOTHER band showed up on it that I already have on a different station. I would have songs from that certain band station I approved of in that other station but I wouldn’t know whether I already thumbed it up in that station so I don’t accidentally get roccomendations for more song from that band or other bands in the station where I only want to listen to ONE bands songs
I am paying for a subscription without commercials and I find that the band announcing their album or tour dates is just as annoying as commercials. Get rid of them.

Let me tell you fine people a little story, I’m driving down the road listening to my favorite English 80’s hair band sing photograph and I said to myself , self you could use a peach tea . So I pulled into a gas station shut off my car and left my phone with the pandora app still open in said car. I go into the store buy my favorite brand of peach flavored tea and come back out , maybe five minutes total. Upon my return my phone had timed out and was on the lock screen , so I reopened it to find the pandora app has shut itself down and it restarts upon opening it . I said to myself “ crap on a cracker! “ and “ I was really enjoying Def Leppard! “ and that story has been repeated many times since the last update . And all this wouldn’t be so bad if it wasn’t for all the in app pop ups that come along with starting the app up ( no I don’t freakin want concert dates! ) , all this has started after the latest update and if pandora premium ( or whatever it’s called now) is anything remotely like this I don’t want it .
It seems that Pandora is now playing games with its upgrade service. Every time....every single time!!! I want to turn on Pandora it asks me if I want to upgrade to its new “play all your favorites” service. I DON’T. I am very eclectic with my music and stick to genres depending on the mood. I don’t want to hear the favorites of all those genres. STOP ASKING. STOP MAKING ME CHECK A SCREEN EVERY SINGLE TIME I WANT TO USE YOUR APP!!! STOP WITH THE SILLY MARKETING TRICKS OF SHIFTING THE GRAPHIC RIGHT WHEN I GO TO HIT THE NO THANKS BUTTON THAT REALLY MAKES ME SELECT THE SERVICE!!!!!!! This is the kind of thing that people goto their congresspeople to find ways to deal with companies abuse like yours. If you don’t stop asking about this service in a week from today 2/27/2018, I will stop using your service for a month. When I come back if you ask me one time if I want to upgrade. I WILL STOP USING PANDORA FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER 6 YEARS. - Seriously!!! 
Love the service, but guess what? I don’t want to pay $12 a month! I also don’t want to have to turn down the offer EVERY TIME I OPEN THE APP!!!!! If the $4 a month I’m paying is no longer enough, I will cancel the subscription and look elsewhere.

It was annoying before- now it's above & beyond overkill. STOP. THE. MADNESS.  I’m also tired of hearing the same songs over & over. 
It has only a few flaws, but it is overall great👍
We are the masters of our story
I just had my phone make me sign in to my Apple Account, then it said “the payment failed” presumably for the Pandora Premium subscription, which it’s randomly pulled up a window to have me sign up for this, under the guise of “renew your subscription” to Pandora One (at $5 per month instead of $13) which, to me, is full on trickery to get me to sign up for something more expensive without my intent or consent. The failure no doubt occurred **ONLY** because I didn’t have enough money in my bank account, and so I would have been had otherwise. Not to mention the countless hours I have to spend trying to resolve this issue - in the hundreds AT LEAST and likely 10,000 to 1,000,000 - and yes, I am aware the upper end of this is more than a human waking lifespan. This knocks a five star app down to one star and I wish I could give it negative 5 billion stars for this evil, deceptive behavior. PANDORA IS EVIL - DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!!! You will only have your hard earned money go to an evil corporation.
I have returned to Pandora remembering how great it was. I know you need to make a living, but really? Talk about overkill. You ruined your service, sorry. Too bad, you were the best!
Fantastic! Fantastic! Fantastic!
Constantly disconnecting with my chromecast, interrupting my music, making it difficult/impossible to like a song I’ve discovered and unable to reconnect to the song I’m currently listening to and just playing a new song while my chromecast is playing the song I wanted to ‘like’. Frustrating. Been like this for months now. Please fix. I’ve stopped using pandora several times because of this.

Thanks a lot d
Being in school pandora has tremendously helped with it. No matter what mood I am in pandora has it. I could be in a soft study mood and pandora has the station for it. I could be in the rock out kind of mood and pandora has the station for me! Best part is you can “train” the station to play what you like with a simple click of the thumbs up button and if you don’t like it you can simply clicked the thumbs down. Overall pandora is amazing and I recommend it to anyone I meet
Fantastic station
I love Pandora. I used to listen to comedy stations on it all the time, but I stopped using the app because of how many ads were constantly littering it. I just reopened the app after months and months of not using it, listened to one comedy skit, and then I was listening to an ad. After one skit. I still love the app, but I wish there were way less ads.
Este es el mejor
Seriously, if it doesn’t stop trying to sell me on the next “tier” of paid service then I’m going to cancel it.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：We believe this issue has now been resolved - if you are still receiving a large number of notifications, can you please reach out to our support team for assistance?

The app keeps on crashing after a couple of songs are played
I like pandora a lot. Worth the extra 4 bucks a month. No talking, no commercials, new music, old school radio platform. I don't know what's gonna play next and I like that.
ThanX!
Esta es mi mejor estación para escuchar i música favorita ❤️😍👍🏽🎧🎼
So I don’t want a trial and I don’t want to be ask indefinitely if I want a trial for the premium service. I’m already paying I don’t want advertising (yes, even from pandora).  Please stop.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：We believe this issue has now been resolved - if you are still receiving a large number of notifications, can you please reach out to our support team for assistance?

I love pandora because we can play it with are phone off and with YouTube you can't and because it can just go on and you don't have to change the song every second
So I have Pandora Premium and it’s been working great! I’ve found so many songs that I liked on here, more than when I tried Spotify! The only little thing I noticed is that the same music sounds of better quality on Apple than on Pandora. I went to settings and changed the sound quality to high, but it’s still not the same as Apple. If that would get fixed that would be awesome
Pandora never wants to connect in my vehicle. If it does, it’s touch and go with connection.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I’ve always enjoyed this app, so I updated to premium which was supposed to consist of no ads and unlimited skips. Never had ads, but I didn’t have unlimited skips
I wish they would STOP trying to push the Premium version every time I open the APP !!!
I got the app to listen to podcast/ talk shows. Instead of allowing me to land on the main pages of the shows the app always puts me on the the first random episode I ever listens to and I have to navigate my way to what I’m looking for.
Hardly plays my thumbed songs and always repeats the same ads at a significantly higher volume
Was really upsetting when the new update came out and the Pandora premium for $12 a month became available, I pay five dollars a month for ad free unlimited Pandora, and now I’m completely bombarded by Pandora trying to get me to update, and pay $12 a month!
Cannot live without Pandora.. listen to music according to my feelings and it’s always on point.
Great music too many commercials tho
I love is app
I’ve used it for years now. Love it.
Can you add a song call now hiring at freddys its a fnaf song and fnaf 1-5 remix by jt machina
To many adds should be another way to get pandora plus then just paying for it should have like a holiday special that you get 3 months free or something
Easy to use and works great. Infinite selections and quality sound, no need for any other player.
The free month it worked great and then after I paid for my first month it stopped working. A lot of the stations would come up unavailable now or wouldn’t load. I switched to Spotify....and it works way better. Not happy at all that I paid for something that wouldn’t work.
I’ve had Pandora Premium for about 2 to 3 months now and it’s being a fun experience, the only frustrating thing is that it won’t let me skip certain songs and after multiple skips it won’t let me skip songs that I’ve never had an issue to skip. If I’m paying a monthly fee for premium I don’t understand why I would have restrictions, makes no sense .
I can’t seem to find a way to cancel this subscription. Getting really frustrated and mad. If I ever get a his thing canceled no way would I ever come back. Pandora has been great but due to unseen circumstances I need to cancel and they cant provide me a way to do that. I guess I will have to cancel my dang credit card and gave them reissue a new. A whole bunch of trouble because this is so user unfriendly. Smh.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I use to adore pandora  and used it everyday, multiple times a day. But, I no longer can skip without having to watch ads. I used to have a certain amount of skips for a song before having to watch ads. Maybe there’s something wrong with my account but it’s frustrating. I’m also to young to purchase the pandora premium and don’t want to use my parents money up. I hope that this is just a bug because if not I’m going to stop using this app and instead only use Spotify.
Been great
There can be only Önė. #BeÖnė #KingdomCame 
Constantly freezing or "buffering". I have full bars or perfect wifi and it still happens. I thought "maybe it'll stop if I get plus or premium" stop by the review section and nope, happens to the unfortunate people who subscribe to you. You've had several months to fix this... maybe service deserves my loyalty more.
Love it! Ads aren’t excessive and the music they”pick” for me is great! LOVE my “thumbs up” station!
Been using Pandora for years and love it.  For the past month they non stop push you to upgrade to their premium service (I\'m already on a paid plan).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：We believe this issue has now been resolved - if you are still receiving a large number of notifications, can you please reach out to our support team for assistance?

I already pay for Pandora’s original membership. Which I say the algorithm needs work. Now every time I open my app or change stations I will be prompted to buy premium. STOP! I have yet to find a way to turn this off. Extremely annoying.
I like this app because it covers so many genres. From contemporary to retro to workouts to comedy routines.  excellent app for any of your tastes.
I just started listening to Pandora again after a long break. It is amazing. When I’m working or studying it just goes and goes. I get lost in the music and time flies.
Everytime I open my pandora app it will go back to the main screen plzzz fix this problem or it keep saying we are having problems at this moment try n reboot your phone I am so frustrated I’m about to go back to spinrilla
I have to redown load pandora everyday to use it
I use this app
I’m a pandora plus listener and love my subscription but the constant feature reminders and asking me to upgrade is terribly annoying! They pop up just about every time I open the app. There’s no way to opt out of it and it’s not considered a push notification. Please stop showing me this! I don’t want to upgrade and I could care less about being told what the new features are!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：We believe this issue has now been resolved - if you are still receiving a large number of notifications, can you please reach out to our support team for assistance?

I love this app! It's free and doesn't have a lot of adds. You can thumb up songs and they will personalize it to where they'll play songs similar to the one you thumbed up. Tons of stations, and is SUPER easy to use. Personally my favorite music app.
Paying a dollar more than when I started. Eventually they gave me unlimited skips, now I have to pay even more for that.
The app charged me for premium service without my consent. Not sure how, but I figured it was a mistake. Unable to find any support or contact info at all. Read through there entire FAQs page to find out that I have to go through a tedious process. I’m talking hours.   Since it is impossible to find anyone to contact, If Pandora is reading this, I’d like a refund.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Pandora has the best selection and recommended tunes are “spot” on! Lol
Should be able to make a playlist of music w/ out premium
Like it.
I wish they didn’t have ads about not having ads. Really annoying.👍🏼
Wow!!!
What more can anyone want? It's a PARTY
Always love the selections!
I’ve been experiencing commercial playing before the songs at over. Example: a song could be 3 minutes long then a commercial will randomly start playing 2 minutes into the song. Then once he commercial is over another song plays. Please fix this ASAP. It’s so annoying I’m starting to just rather listen to Apple Music.
Love it
I keep clicking on radios and it keeps saying the station is not available. My WiFi is working fine with every other app I’m using right now. So can you guys give me some advice on what to do?  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Been using the service for years and the algorithm for learning what music I like on different stations is terrible. Not sure how “new music” can be loaded with Michael Jackson and the BGs.   Also - two songs and then two ads. You get better “new music” and less ads from the local radio station.  Time to check out Apple Music - this service totally blows now. 
Great!!😊there are a great variety of songs but......there are alot pf adds
Great!  But....why doesn’t the iPad app’s functionality match that of the iPhone?  Let me sort my stations by most recent and let me replay songs on the iPad, like the iPhone can do, and stop restarting the app every time I make a quick phone call and come back to find that the song I was enjoying won’t resume, and I’ll give you 5 stars  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ 
No matter what I have to do during an entire day, because while cleaning, working, jogging, reading, driving, or going to sleep there’s always a music theme to listen to. I LOVE PANDORA!
Been pandora since 2008 at least
I work in construction and use the Pandora app on my phone all the time. A few months ago I agreed to the one week free trial that will pop up from time to time with the other adds that come with the free version. No where in that offer does it say that it will start charging you after the one week is up with a constant renewal at the max rate  of 12.99 plus tax. So $75.00 later I come to realize what is going on, I feel completely decieved and because of that I will never use this app again.
just play the artist I asked for on the station I asked for ...no need for suggestions.. I wanna listen to lil Uzi & Bryson tiller or Chris brown pop up whaaattttt theeeeee fkckkkkkk😂😂  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Thanks for the feedback. It sounds like you may be interested in our on-demand service, Pandora Premium!   For more information, please visit: https://www.pandora.com/upgrade   Or if you have any additional questions, feel free to reach out to our support 
Seems like every time I open or do something with this app, it asks me to upgrade from Plus to Premium. It even shifts the buttons so that in the time it takes for me to respond and hit Not Now I end up hitting Upgrade and then have to wait to cancel. Pretty crummy.   So you win, Pandora. You’re obviously unhappy about my paying you monthly for my Plus subscription so I’ll go ahead, cancel it, and use some other music service.   I hope this will finally make you happy. 
I love how it learns from my thumbs ups so well that it doesn’t take anytime for me any new playlist to be jamming!
What a blessing to have pure, Christian instrumental music to listen to!
Seriously. Like, the only advantage to premium is no ads. U can’t get unlimited skips; it’s hard to find good songs on the stations, so by the time ur done skipping the songs u don’t want to hear, ur out of skips. Spotify premium is SO much better, u can play more songs u want to listen to instantly... if ur in radio mood, don’t waste money on premium, just use original Pandora..
Love it
I live in a bad service area. So I get a lot of use out of the offline stations. I wish that there was a way to just create a huge playlist with songs that I have thumbs up. Also if you could add more than three offline stations.
Stop prompting me to upgrade to premium. I already pay for the service. I don't want premium. So prompting me every other time I open the app
Best music app everrr!!! Just one suggestion we should be able to pick our own music. But after that best music app ever!
Music satisfaction 🙏🏾
I have used Pandora for years, love it, until I dit the update. I can no longer open the app on my phone or my iPad. I have deleted it and reloaded, turned off devices, nothing works.

you’re very good
I like this app but I feel like you can just search up these songs on YouTube instead of having to wait for a good song to come on.
Keeps saying there are no more songs in the station, and I have to choose a new station. Very annoying when it happens about once every 30 minutes.
I keep restarting my phone because pandora doesn't want to play music !!!!!
It doesn’t matter what artist you pick you never know what is going to play. I started a Metallica channel and got a Jonny Cash song. Now I like Cash but that was not what I was in the mood for.
I love this app I just don’t like the commercials but there alright I guess🙃
Well I love Pandora if it’s the West Coast thing if it’s a East Coast thing at the south thing at the north thing, it’s everything I can listen to my reggae I can listen to my funky hillbilly tunes it all works for me it all sounds good thank you Pandora
Great when needed and not prepared
This is a great app for listening to your favorite songs just find the right playlist.
App not working at all.
Loved before adds now not so much. I love music not advertisements. Find another way to profit and be the best
Love it 😍
☦️,I enjoyed the music I appreciated very kindly and appreciated being free even more be blessed have a wonderful day great app!!!!❤️
The app repeatedly nags me to upgrade to premium even though I’m already subscribed to Plus. I don’t want Premium. Ever. Stop bugging me about it! Also, the app randomly starts playing after disconnecting from Bluetooth. Not right away, mind you. It waits long enough for it to be either startling or embarrassing.
Old or new if it isn’t on pandora it’s cuz no ones sang it yet
I paid the subscription to remove ads and now every time I open the app I have to click “no thanks” on Pandora bugging me to upgrade to their premium service. Leave me alone; I know you have a premium service and I don’t want it!
Every time I open the app it prompts me to upgrade from the standard paying membership to premium. I’ve had to dismiss this option several times a day for months. There is no option to disable this prompt. A weekly prompt would be fine, but not EVERY TIME.
Makes me so mad how difficult they make it to cancel a subscription!!
I like pandora and all but I hate listening to songs I don't like and after about an hour of watching ads to skip trashy songs and being forced to listen to "Licensed songs" ( meaning the ones I like I can't listen to when I want to and you can’t skip them ) even with premium you still deal with “ Licensed songs” which I feel is not right since it costs like 13 bucks for premium. I’ve also noticed that if you dislike too many songs that they will kick you from that station and won’t let you play it anymore. ( I have found ways around it but it’s still bs and sometimes it still doesn’t work ) most of the times you have to add variety which gives you more garbage that u will have to thumbs down. What really makes this a 2 Star rating is that the songs a thumb down some how get unthumb downed and I have to listen to the song and then thumbs down it again and again until eventually a different song I had thumb downed comes up again. It’s very irritating. There are also a few bugs I’ve noticed like randomly pandora turns itself on and plays music when I don’t want it to or it randomly says it is unable to play a song and to restart the app. It’s still nice to get to listen to the variety of songs and I don’t mind paying money for the premium. However it would be great if the Bugs and getting kicked from your station all the time didn’t happen.
U can pick ur playlist and there r radios with the music u like!! One thing Pandora could work on is the skip limit for the songs but that’s it!!  Instagirl05 
This is a great app and all but I don’t think you need to pay to get special treatment if you ant money make us pay for the app. And when you don’t pay you get 6 skips, and way way to many adds. I live their music and all but really to many adds
You can pick from any music and you can listen to your all time favorite songs 🙂 you can also replay the song which is even better.
I am very frustrated with Pandora. It will not work. They are charging me monthly for access and I’ll I could get with iPhoneX is offline music. I deleted it to reinstall and all my offline music is now gone too. How do I either get it back or stop monthly charges?  I do not want Premium I don’t use it that much.
Please add an equalizer!!!
There’s buffering at times but the stations I’ve created are always playing my likes
I have used Pandora for a LONG time.  I even got Pandora One when it became available to avoid the commercials and the cost seemed reasonable.  Then, Pandora Premium came out and that stupid pop up popped up every time I opened the app to upgrade.    My fat thumb hit it one day and then when I went to close the app out, my iPhone sensed my fingerprint and upgraded me.    Now, I have tried to drop my subscription back to Pandora One, or completely, and the help section for iTunes isn’t helpful.  The link won’t work on my PC, my app won’t let me do it, and I can’t do it in the App Store either.  Now I’m being charged more for something I didn’t want because of stupid pop ups.    I just want to have regular Pandora One back without having to jump through all these hoops. 
I listen to pandora all time and been paying for the paid version but im am getting do tired of their constant premium trial crap. I pay to not get ads. Stop i will stop using pandora!
With the recent update all it does when I open the app is stay on the pandora logo  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing!

It’s ok. Decent playlist. Not too quality audio. Waist too many ads. They keep buggin for a review so here you are.
Yo! Thumbs up all around for Pandora! There’s honestly no better app for music~ I’ve dedicated my time to just giving likes and dislikes. Overtime the app plays nothing but the most enjoyable tracks. What up pandora! Many loves & hearts my DUDES! &hearts;  <html=jk> 
This app does exactly what it promises: you put in a song or artist and it plays music related to that song.  Also keeps track of what you like/dislike and has it all listed out so you can find those songs again later.
Last update for pandora has slowed down the app so bad :( and it freezes and auto closes really bummed Pandora and I pay to be a premium member. Fix this please.

My love 💕💎💎💎💎
Please fix this app. All of the sudden the app crashes and now it won’t let me login and listen to my music. Please help and fix this soon if possible.                                          Thank you 
I have the premium package and it’s fantastic it better than buying music wend you can listen to anything you want.
I love pandora because you can have all the songs you would like
Pandora is the best subscription music service! Love it.
I use Pandora for the ride to work and showering mainly. Also when I do things around the house. I only have one complaint. Eminem keeps showing up on my Nickelback station. The two ARE NOT related.
I love pandora and all the great songs.
Love this app so much. Just because I can listen to my favorite people on here like one direction, little mix, etc.
Too many pop ups as I try to navigate menus slow down the experience. Lacks features present on PC that may be there but are not navigiavle to update to update. New look is less informative than the old one and manages to take more resources. Features like showing the song playing on my lock screen and spamming me with ads to upgrade when I like a song are far less interesting than optimization and reliability changes for each device I own. Uninterested in purchasing premium until it runs smoothly without crashing or using a large portion of my battery life.
This app is great because I can play all the great music even when my phone is turned off 🤗🤗🤗
I think Pandora needs a new update. But first of all, I just want to say thank you to the amazing people who create Pandora, because they created an app that lets me listen to my favorite music and Pandora has all of that to the perfection. Sadly, recently Pandora has been taking a while to load. I know that if this is happening it might be because of the WIFI or something, but I have already checked and all seems fine. I just wanted to let you know and thank you so much for an efficient yet amazing app.
Great new music played whenever you want. Doesn’t get much better..
It’s simply awesome! From PFunk to Acid Jazz  I love it.  The ability to create your series of favorite tunes to vibe to as you cruise around is the best. 
Pandora is simply the Best of the Best out there!!!
App Crashed on Bohemian Rhapsody. I am forever scarred.
I love the app itself, but lately every single time I open the app, there is a pop-up asking me if I want to upgrade to pandora premium!  If this was once a month or even every couple weeks I’d understand.  But this has become a real nuisance.  Hopefully they will change this soon & I will update my rating!  That is no way to get someone to upgrade.
This is in my opinion one of the best music apps on the market plus it is free. (Unless you do subscriptions)
Last update fix the problem every once in a while updates will cause problems but then they update it again and it fixes the problem other than that amazing app  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I have a plus account and I have to make an extra tap every time I use it now because of a solicitation for premium. I don’t want it! Leave people who already pay alone!
The constant repeat of the exact same commercial (sometimes 2 or 3 times in a row) is annoying. Also I’ve had this app on 3 phones and reinstalled it several times but it still drops its volume after a few songs while driving. It is the only music app that I have that does this.
The ads. The ads are horrible. I don’t think you should have to pay to get no ads.  And its expensive!!!!
Well pandora premiums price went up and the actually don’t let you skip unlimited skips. I feel like I’m being scammed with their premium and went to go cancel and sent me to a page full of terms and conditions. Deleting app  Edited: As far as the developers response goes.  Whoever you are, you are a hack. How about be honest and make it SIMPLE if you care to cancel premium.

Crazy number of ads!! Sometimes every 2 songs... only good thing is when u can watch one ad for 1 hour of ad-free listening... u have to pay attention to click on that when it happens

The update to the Pandora app is horrible! Please go back to the last version. It worked great! With the update, you can’t even shuffle the stations manually. Plus it’s now charging me for Prime ($12.99 month) instead of Plus ($4.99 month). I’m not happy with Pandora anymore.
Pandora made it harder to cancel the subscriptions. Thru destop, i don’t see the subscription option to cancel. I was charge ~$79. I hate it. I will make sure i get my money back.
I go to buy premium and it tells me that subscriptions are unavailable at this time please try again later?  I love pandora but I want ad free anybody help me out ? Please?

I use Yoga radio to put the babies to sleep but because of your loud, obnoxious ads every 10 minutes, they wake up. No I am not paying for no ads. Hello Spotify
Pandora is my therapist
Plays the same 5 songs everyday Plays songs that have nothing to do with the station Plays the same ad 3x every commercial break 
Before pandora I was listening to music I didn’t want to hear on the radio.  Now I can satisfy any mood with my favorite music of any kind. Thank you Pandora!
Every time I open the app and am trying to select stations I get two popups that I must dismiss before I can proceed. One is an upsell to Pandora premium (I already pay for Plus) and the other is trying to get me to log into Facebook.  I do not want either of these things. I just want to change stations. Terrible user experience design choice - please just let me use the app that I am paying for. 
I use to love pandora, but as time has gone on they have struggled. I gave their premium a shot, but I downloaded their music with that service 4-5 times and when I go to play downloaded music is says I don’t have any. Not a good way to compete with Apple Music. They can keep their music, I’ll go with a reliable music provider
Pandora A+ I hope they bring it to Canada soon ... MTL-514
I love this app 😂 I gts listening I highly recommend this app.
Excellent app and music service.  Does a better job than the rest.  Late to the game in terms of music on demand but they make up for it in functionality.  Go premium, it is fully with it.
Not mids
The app works great on my iPhone. However it doesn’t even open on the Apple Watch.
Pandora great music all day everyday!
Luv being able to customize our selections with our fav musicians.  👍👍
Best ever! Pandora for life!
I have a paid subscription and when you go to skip a song it will skip up to 8 songs in a row.  I emailed Pandora and the fix was to uninstall and reinstall.  This worked for a day but now the same thing.  I have been a subscriber for years and this is the first bad experience I have had.  Very frustrating..please help
Some songs can’t be played because it’s only allowed on the radio station due to licensing, I rather unsubscribe and go back to my previous provider if it means having to limit my preferences in choice of music.
I have to admit, it’s nice to be able to get round the clock music at any genre anytime. One has to make the choice of enduring the ads that may throw you off if the music has you in a rhythm. But when it comes down to a fee being paid and the service is horrible? What are you using the money for that the company charges monthly coming out of my account like clockwork! Get it together with the skipping and the freezing up. I’m not listening to vinyl or a cd-IT IS DIGITAL!!!!!!!!!
This is a flawed app because the interface is not intuitive. Simple tasks such as saving a track has no easy path.  Genres are also misnamed with instrumental genres having singing.
My account gets switched out of premium quite often even though I have a monthly subscription for premium set up. It’s so frustrating because there’s no real way to refresh or rest and I get stuck with pandora plus even though I pay for premium  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing!

look I love pandora but I just HATE how many ads there is. Like tone down the ads geeez!
Beautiful music again thank you from the bottom  Of my heart ❤️🧡💛💚 
I currently have a monthly plus membership; have for years, but having to decline premium membership every few songs is having me question a $5 monthly fee.
App use to be awesome, now they put an add after every song it seems. They make you pay a monthly to make the app bearable
Please, please, please. Stop asking if I want to upgrade to Premium. I don't. I tried it for free for two months and barely used it.  The main problem is I have Pandora plus and you keep asking if I want to upgrade, every day.  So stop. Please. 
Best app
This used to be a great service but for the past 2 years it has become unbelievably buggy.  I use it in my car using the built in app but every time I leave the house and my phone switches from WiFi to cell Pandora gets hopelessly confused. I contacted support and their suggestion was that I unpair and repair my phone with the car EVERY SINGLE TIME I GO SOMEWHERE. How asinine is that?  Even their web based service is broken. On multiple computers with multiple browsers the service constantly breaks. It gets into a mode where it stops after each song and you have to close and reopen the browser.   If you contact support it doesn’t matter what you write. They ignore it and send you incredibly generic instructions (try uninstalling and reinstalling - that should fix it!).   Considering this is a paid service the quality of the product and support experience is abysmal. There are many other music services out there. Do yourself a favor and give one of them a try and save yourself a lot of frustration. 
It seems to know what I want to here next 😂
So far I’m loving it. Now all I have to do is upgrade to premium. 💪🏾🕺🏾
Was a really good app and now it won't even open
When the time is right ! they are there . Non stop , fewer breaks with what you love . No need to stop and change tape or recording.just a banging good time and tunes. 
I will not pay this site until I have No problems. I try to listen to for 30 days. It does not work and do not pay for it. Going it try Apple Music
I don't usually hear the same song twice in a work day. Plus it throws in quite a few catchy tunes that I don't know yet.
Very majestic I have Pandora one on my other phone just alike
How do I stop the upgrade alert. I’m fine with what I have.
For a few weeks now anytime I’m listening to Pandora if I get a phone call or if I pause my music and do something else on my phone and I go back into Pandora it restarts. It changes the song even if it just started. It doesn’t matter  what I do ... when I go back into it, it just restarts. Why?! I’ve never had this problem. It’s pretty frustrating.
The new Pandora is rocking
Yes  The comments made by the guy on 12/13 having the same problem after upgrading seems I have 2 different versions Slow to load and doesn’t recognize me as a subscriber

13-year Pandora family (6ppl). Listen up, because we are gone. Six premium accounts canceled today.   The “Music Genome Project” got Pandora famous, but is it the paramount feature now? Not even close.   Pandora of yesteryear helped music lovers find more music they might never have heard of before. That was the point.  Nowadays, Pandora is nothing but a struggling competitor only adding copycat features from other non-genome music providers.  The Music Genome Project is DEAD!  Pandora is run by SELLOUTS!  Recently, I\'ve noticed Pandora notifications are trying to annoy me. Ticket sales to concerts are NOT ACCEPTABLE! I PAY FOR THIS SERVICE, STOP TRYING TO GET ME TO BUY STUFF!  Were gone. Our entire family just left Pandora for Amazon Music.   Goodbye Pandora. It\'s was fun, but you\'ve had over a decade with us and you\'re simply not going to out-game Amazon. Why you guys ever thought it was a good idea to try I will never know.  READ THIS PANDORA SUPPORT:  It\'s a shifty practice, the way too many horrible customer service departments work. Stop telling people to go to some support forum, you dolts! Were iPhone users. We don\'t put up with that crap. You help us or you don\'t, but feel PRIVILEGED that we offer a review. Stop asking us to do ANYTHING more, you pompous, egotistical SFBs. 
My mental health has improved significantly during these times of strife by listening to my Zen station ALL THE TIME!
So I pay for ad free listening, and Pandora thinks that gives them permission to show me an obnoxious pop-up ad, with no way to stop it, that forces me to click no thanks several times per day... that is not ad free. That is the exact opposite.   I’m this close to cancelling and removing Pandora entirely. If I wasn’t interested 6 months ago, and I wasn’t interested those 300 times you asked every time I use Pandora after that, I’m not going to be interested now. 
I updated and everything it described in the update started happening. It was fine before. Now I can’t connect to Bluetooth in my vehicle. And it will just start playing on my phone randomly and not turn off.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble.

Stop putting ads and if so then have a skip ads on the side so disappointed 👎🏼
Pandora has always been my favorite app you can get it free from the App Store
I have been listening to pandora since college which was 10 years ago. I love it! Recently one of their updates included new pop ups whenever you switch stations or search for things. It’s driving me crazy! No helpful and very repetitive. When I click yes on them nothing changes. I’ve been looking for a way to give feedback to their developers but I haven’t found a way. I hope they read this.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing!

Absolutely love the station I’ve created!  The more songs I like the more it plays just the right track every time!  Nothing better!
Pandora, what happened?   this app barely works now, thanks 🖕🤬 
I’ve wrote twice about how bad pandora is and no one has gotten back to me I think I’m just going to cancel my subscription and get Apple music🤷🏾‍♀️
Please add a toggle that allows me to only play songs that have not been rated thumbs up or thumbs down.  I’d like to play only new music sometimes.  Right now I select “I’m tired of this track” for most of my songs.
I used to love this app! Now I find it’s more annoying than pleasurable. I understand that I am working through the free app, but there is a limit. I am tired of being asked every five minutes if I want to try the free premium trial. If I want to try the trial I will sign up for it. I don’t mind a few offers a day, but six offers in one hour of listening is too much. It badgers the listener! I have also noticed that I no longer see the images pertaining to the cover art of the musical artist.  If a certain song is playing and I’d like to know who that artist is so I can give it a thumbs up, well I can’t do that! Because every time I look at my iPad there is a full-blown advertisement for somebody’s pillow, or a sleep number bed or some other accoutrements. I have to walk over and touch the iPad to block out the ad and enlarge the image that pertains to the music that is currently playing. The music has now taken a backseat and the ads are dominating the screen all the time!  When I’m lying in bed and I have my meditation station on and something comes on I may be interested in giving a thumbs up to I cannot because the ad is now all over the screen-all the time! In the very beginning the ads would  occasionally flash and then they would reseed and the cover art so to speak for the particular artist would return to the screen. Those days are now gone! The balance between the two is out of whack now and as a listener I find it highly annoying, unnecessary and very frustrating.  Bring it back to the way it used to be. Some things are best left alone. It wasn’t ever broken. Is this app providing me with music, or showing me an ‘Egg Test’ to sell me a bed?  I’m tired of seeing Goldilocks 25 times a day! 
I had pandora since it first appeared. Two days ago all my stations wiped out. Gone. I\'m so upset and can\'t even figure out why or find a number to call. What happened pandora?  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble!

Pandora is truly one of my most used apps. But upon option I choose to seek where I can choose a song( I realize that’s on the paid version). But the shuffle mode of songs I don’t have downloaded is very appealing and has been for the last 5 years.   There should be a artist type shuffle and a song type shuffle option where it plays the artist you want or songs by artists similar. 
Good
Love iiiitttt
Update the app it’s draining my battery
The stations in pandora have become unavailable, no matter how much I restart the app. I can’t listen to my music
I don’t know what it is, but I cannot for the life of me find the setting to connect to my tv anymore. I have chrome cast on my tv and was able to connect it to my tv before, but I can’t find the option to do so anymore. I can connect it using YouTube or Spotify but can’t for Pandora.

You’re a good singer
I love pandora it really helpful when cleaning or if you are really busy or not in a good mood music will give time to breathe and be happy
Wish there were more skips other than that the app is amazing
It’s not compatible with other apps like it makes Snapchat and instagram really slow
Why am I being charged for Upgrade..? $2.98
All of the music that I lessen to is just great!!  Thanks for letting me enjoy it. It makes the world around me seem so much better and brings me closer to the one that holds my hand.  Thanks!!  Rochelle Russell 
This app has a lot of music that you and your family can listen to if you choose your station it’ll know ever song you want to hear
Even when I update the app, it still crashes out of nowhere. Hope this gets fixed!
It’s so easy to upgrade via the app, but if you want to cancel- you need to go to a desktop computer (didn’t need that to sign up), and follow a bunch of steps.  I’m still not able to cancel.  I will not sign up again for Pandora, and I will advise everyone I know to stay away.  Shouldn’t make it so difficult to cancel.  Poor customer service.  We all know the technology is there to cancel via the app.....they just hope you don’t get around to going on desktop to cancel. 
I listen to it all day at work. I love it, I wish I had discovered Pandora many years ago!
While traveling thru the UK , I tried to enjoy some of my favorite music. GUESS WHAT?,,, not available in the Uk.  Still like it , but , used Spotify while pandora is sleeping
All pay subscriptions should offer replay lock..
So I was listening to Pandora in my car, then I turned it off so my phone can just charge. It kept turning on multiple times. I kept turning it off. Why is this happening now? I need my phone to charge not play Pandora. Then this one artist keeps coming up no matter how many times I 👎🏽 ALL of his songs. Can you create a feature that blocks certain artist completely? The reason why I gave Pandora 4 stars is because these are my only complaints. Everything else is great.
I pay for Pandora’s middle tier, but literally every time I turn pandora on it tries to push the top tier on me. I’ve said no dozens of times, which is dozens of times too many. If it doesn’t stop soon I will cancel the middle tier too.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for the trouble you are experiencing - this is something we are actively looking into.

Always will love and appreciate pandora!!
I like the clean, simple layout. Been listening to Pandora for over a year now and am happy with the content. I’m using the free version.
I love how there is the newest songs and how you can have an unlimited amount of stations. I wish that you didn't have to pay to listen to the songs you want to but it’s still an awesome app.!
Awesome for work!!
I’m already subscribed to Pandora. I pay money every month. But my god how hard do you have to push the top level subscription?!?! Every time I open the app and while listening, too! It’s ridiculous. Quit it!  Previous review: Dig it. Works for me and no problems, especially after I subscribed.

Absolutely fantastic. I absolutely love Pandora. Best music ever.
It's great
Have been a Pandora user since 2010(?) and just subscribed last year. The app seems to have less problems syncing w/my MDX then iTunes & I’m using an iPhone. Great job Pandora iOS app team. Thanks.
I have Pandora plus for a year. It loops. So I hardly get to listen to new songs especially in my limited driving time. And sneaky Pandora wants me to try Premium trial. And there is no easy way to discontinue the trial. Invariably it asks me whether i want the free trial when I am driving because that is when I listen to pandora. So all this shady marketing tactics made me discontinue even their plus subscription. There may be better music apps out there for your money. Don’t get this.
I’m waiting to hear my single/Gravity on my pandora station - Dremon Radio And haven’t sent it once yet..
Listening to Miles Davis on Pandora, sublime. Can’t say more.
When I go skip a song sometimes it doesn't respond or it glitches it's slow, unresponsive, always an ads and pandora premium pop ups you guys should include a feature that allows us to turn the pandora premiums off because that's annoying for people who just want to listen to music I'm very disappointed in your app.
I pay for Pandora, I have for years. I really like the app, all the new music I've been introduced to, etc. What I really dislike is the relentless pop up trying to get me to upgrade to Pandora Premium. STOP, I'm happy, leave me alone. It makes me want to cancel the service. Annoying as heck I can't turn off Pandora's advertisements of itself. I pay for no ads, turn off your ads too! 5 stars when you stop. Hey, only asked me 7 times today... <sigh> I use to love Pandora, now I hate it.
How do I cancel my subscription?
5 star
Seems to crash a good bit. Variety of likes and dislikes need improvements. Plays songs that aren’t like any of the other songs I liked. Skips songs by itself without me pushing the skip, button so it uses all of my skips. Pandora use to be a pretty amazing app, now it seems like it's on a downhill sloop sadly.
Love you guys don't stop playing pandora plz
Great music selection. Plays the songs you like random. Love how you can pick a certain group or person and it will keep playing groups with in that type of music. Love pandora.
Greatest thing since sliced bread, every moment, emotion, feeling etc. all at the press of a button. Love it!!!!
This app is great for listening to music and many artist with out having to pay any money or much at all.
I hate the fact that there are skip limits, that’s not good!
Amazing! Has all the greatest songs! My only complaint is not being able to skip as much and having all the ads. But, everyone know that these kind of apps have this kind of thing... sadly. It also works/loads pretty quickly. You should definitely get it!
This is app is the best it has all my favorite songs on it love it
App is awesome,should have unlimited skips though :/

In recent weeks, I’ve been overrun with glitches, and all Pandora says is to do all kinds of stuff on my browser to keep it running.  No.  It needs to run turn key.  On my phone, it always drops in to offline mode, yet all my other streaming services work flawlessly.  Everywhere.  Pandora barely plays two songs before it goes to offline mode.  I used to tell everyone Pandora was the best in terms of music and service.  Now they hide behind a wall and will not confess they have serious problems.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

This app is predatory in the way that it loads up you go to click no thanks for the trial of pandora premium and then it slides the screen down to click sign up and with Touch ID it’s easy to accidentally pay for it when trying to close out of the app as you have missed clicked due to the design of the app.
Excelente radio
Man, if I could delete a song from a playlist and remove thumbs up this would be 5 stars hands down.
Nice for music :))
Absolutely ridiculous that it upgrades you to premium with a thumbprint every time you enter the app. Opened it and had my thumb in the home button and got upgraded so ridiculous and annoying. Deleting the app for good.
Love their recommendations.
Love my Pandora.... Everyday
I’ve come back to using pandora after a few years solely using Spotify.  They both have their pros and cons but for general radio/station updates the app is excellent!!
Wish this app would stop trying to sell me the premium every time I open it.  I tried it on my other phone and hated it.  Went back to ITunes’ unlimited.  Pandora doesn’t have as many songs available.
I am a long time (10+ yr) Pandora subscriber. With the new update, every time I launch the app I get pushed to "buy it" (hint: you already get my money) with a "maybe later" forced-choice button that sometimes slides away to put the "yes buy now" button under my finger.  Not cool, Pandora. No means no. Stop it. 
I am a long time subscriber and lover of the app.  I have discovered so much music and artists thanks to it.  However lately every time I start the app I get a prompt for 30 day free trial of premium app.  If I say no a hundred times can the app get a clue that I am not interested?  The trial prompt is very disruptive.  Maybe this is what to expect with the new owners who are known for being very agressive with their pricing and product push. Case in point when I did not subscribe to an expiring satellite radio sub I was offer deal after deal with deep discounts well over 80% off.  Crazy marketing.   Should I too switch to Spotify like thousands of subscribers have done in past months?

I am really discovering music for the first time with the ease of pandora and narrowing in on the music that moves me. New songs and artist of similar styles. The ease that it will play again and add music that I like.
I’ve been a longtime Pandora One customer and a recent change to the app is really irritating. Every other time I open the app I get a pop-up asking if I want to upgrade to Premium. No I don’t. So how about you take that answer and turn off the pop-up so I don’t keep seeing it? Because continuing to ask is certainly not going to make me change my mind. I’m already paying for your service...quit nagging me to buy more when I’ve told you repeatedly I don’t want it.
Got to love the fact that all you need to know is the artist and you will be listening to them plus music like it!!!
Thank you for this app cause I love to listen to music and it has all of my favorite songs one of my favorites are MOST GIRLS
They place and move the ads where it makes you sign up for premium. Shady. More ads than music.
We rock out daily
I am very impressed with pandora! It picks music for me perfectly and even though there are ads, there are not WAY to many of them. Plus, ads never interrupt your music, they only show up once a song has ended. This app is just like Spotify only much more personalized. You can get premium for 12.99 and plus for 4.99. When you buy premium or plus, the trial lasts for one month. I have had free trials for both and they are DEFINITELY worth it! This app is a must have!
Have a love of music Pandora delivered every time like a lot of different types easy to switch back and forth.
I love this app soooooo much I can say enough good things n for free girl u really can go wrong plus they really listen to the songs that u like as long as u hit the like button they will play all the time u listen to ur station and also they suggest songs related to what you enjoy listening to 👌🏼
One of my most used apps and by far my favorite
Excellent app for music
It is frustrating when listening to a channel and, in the middle of a song or ad, it says “station currently unavailable.” It’s been doing it now for the last few weeks. And I’ll have only been listening to that station for a couple hours. I’ve tried closing the app and restarting it but that does not work. Please fix.
I enjoy creating my stations with my favorites which I can enjoy with the tap of a finger!
Every single time you open the app, it bugs you to connect your Facebook, and pushes you to sign up for the most expensive premium option. I'm already paying for plus. Be happy you're getting that much. Stop putting so much junk in the app.
Love Love Love my Pandora !!🎼
Love your music and the app!!😁😁😁😁😁
I wish Pandora would stop asking me to upgrade. If I want to upgrade I will
This is a awesome music app, it works very well and you can bring it anywhere anytime, 5 stars!
Every time I open the app it tells me to change from pro to premium. You are passively harassing your existing customer base.
I pay monthly for “ad-free” Pandora One, only to receive ads from Pandora to upgrade (aka pay even more) for Pandora to stop the upgrade ads? Please cut it out! I’ve had this app for 6+ years and with the recent and constant “upgrade now!” ads, this is not the ad-free service you promised. Nor is what I’m paying for.
So I got the free trial. Commercials!  Charged $12.99 for my my first month. Commercials!  Still not seeing the benefit!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I love Pandora and have used some of the same stations for years on my computer and phone. I appreciate that the music adjusts to your responses to tracks they suggest. More often than not, when I thumbs down a track, Pandora suggests a song that follows the same style I am looking for that the song I disliked. It is so slick that you can create inspiration for a station and Pandora finds the songs similar to them for you! The only bummer is that with the last update, the option to add variety was taken away-or I haven’t found it, yet. I have found some new artists I would like to add to one of my longest running playlists, and may just need to be patient. The updates do tend to be more user-friendly than the last, but they are vastly different. So prepare to be on your toes. :) Overall, this music app has been dependable for me for nearly a decade!
This is the best app since the first Brain-Gut app that diagnoses IBS issues.
I have been using this app for years and I love it!  I have paid for the highest level for years also but now they have a even higher level which does nothing for me.  Every time I open the app now there is a pop up trying to sell me there premium crap.  I already pay I don’t want to pay more and I don’t want you to ask me 500 times if I want to!!!!  Turn off the pop up junk for your subscribers or we will move to other music apps that don’t have pop-ups when you pay there services!!
Just because people are not paying for pandora does mean you have to flood them with advertisements. There’s so many options for people to listen to music and honestly if this does change I’ll be deleting the pandora app.
Enjoyable.
Great service!
Won’t stop asking me to buy premium!  No way to disable forever.  I already pay for the normal service, which is what I need
I have been paying for pandora premium for over a year, and its incredibly frustrating. When i switch from online to offline to get in my car, it doesn’t transfer, two songs in it makes the offline chime, then stops all music. I have to close and reopen my pandora three times and turn off my wifi search for it to finally work properly, and even then it doesn’t. Then, when I’m getting out of my car, pause the music and close the app, it starts playing again, just randomly and the app isn't even open. So i reopen the app, pause the music close it again, and it still is playing. I have to restart my phone every time for this. This is the second time I’ve brought it up.
I’ve been a pandora subscriber for many years. Ever since the launch of the new higher tier subscription level, I have to dismiss a nag screen every time I launch the app.  The nag screen is asking me to start a free trial of the premium service.  I only get the option to start the trial, or “not now”.  Stop this or I’m leaving.  Just stop. 
Makes my day
I have the free version and I love it!
Let's get real, nobody plays all the songs I wanna hear and everybody throws in songs on my mixes that seem to come from outer space and leave me wondering "how the hell did that song show up on my playlist?!?" But Pandora, you do it better than all the rest...  That being said, please stop asking me to upgrade to premium every time I open the app!!!!!!!!!!! 
Love pandora... not much commercials lately.
The app is usually great, but recently I’ve run into an issue. When I shut the app off, it will randomly start playing a few minutes later. It doesn’t show up as running, but it plays until I open the app and shut it down again. This isn’t a major issue, but it is a bit frustrating.
With the premium version of pandora ... this app becomes  almost perfect like ... it’s great the only problem I seen is some songs it say “due to our licensing can’t add song” but you can thumbs it up and still add it to that playlist... and can’t play some artists for the same reason ... but the radio stations stay on topic and don’t wonder of to weird songs ... I love the app so far
Best music app I’ve ever had!
As a long time paid pandora customer, I am used to an ad free experience. I am on Pandora Plus $4.99 per month. Every day, multiple times per day, a full screen ad pops up to try Pandora Premium with choices: Upgrade or Not now.   The choices are close enough together that careful aim is necessary to select Not now. The aggravation is that obviously as an existing Pandora customer I am already familiar with the product offering.   Why keep prompting me to upgrade?!!!! Why every day? Why multiple times per day? Why cripple my paid pandora service experience?  There should be a third selection for a permanent opt-out: no thanks, I’m happy customer as is, stop badgering me!!   The up-sell strategy should be based on increased value, not “we’ll stop bugging you to upgrade”.  If there is no way to opt-out of these excessive, unnecessary and consequently annoying up-sell ads soon, I’ll be moving to a competitor. 
The best
Pandora is nice but it is much simpler to use Spotify because you make playlists and play and song which you need to buy pandora premium to do.
I just wish to have more variety on the stations!
It’s awesome
Generally good app for listening, but then you removed access to bookmarks on the mobile app??? WHY???? I have to log on to my desktop version to access my bookmarks now. Absurd!
I always love finding new editions to my life’s soundtrack and pandora helps bring me to new songs and artists I would have never heard otherwise!!
Best ever - go to Jay.den946 go follow at  Instagram
Play the band for the station I play
It’s a good app!!
This app would be better if this app wasn’t so money hungry and spamming you with ads
Too many repeat songs and Commercials every two songs.
This music is so good for my anxiety and depression also I am having pain right now because I cracked my knee and it takes my mind off the pain listening to the music
I currently have pandora plus.  If I wanted premium I would get it. With the last few updates it’s always asking me to upgrade. If this keeps up I will be canceling my plus membership. I pay for plus to avoid ads and then pandora repays me with their own ads.
Please please add Thailand music!!!!! On other note I’ve been with Slacker, songza was the best, Spotify, I only go to Spotify for Thai music, been over 10 years online music now I’m hooked with Pandora for years! Please add Thai music!!!
💪😃👍🇵🇷
Since I discovered pandora, I can truly say through it I relive every decade since my junior years . Every song from each decade .... is definitely the best thing ever ...
This app is very slow and crashes a lot. I heard a lot of positive feedback so that’s why I subscribed to Pandora Premium and honestly, it just feels like a waste of money. The music is limited due to the license, and sometimes my music will refuse to play. It puts me in the worst mood. I’ll restart the app 10 times and the music will still not play, even though it’s supposedly “downloaded” to my phone. I pay 12$ a month for it to not play music when I want it to? These issues seem easily fixable, but no update has really worked any magic. I’m  probably going to switch to Spotify soon. 
I love it so much because I love mercy me
Pandora has songs that you love search you station its cool and yeah I rated it 5 stars
Although Pandora used to be unquestionably one of my favorite music streaming apps, it always seems to crashes 5 songs in. It\'s really irritating when you\'re in the groove.   Hopefully they can find a permanent solution to this unnecessary problem. also the sheer amount of ads make a horrendous listening experience!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble. Please try uninstalling and reinstalling the app as this may resolve the issue you’re experiencing.   *Be aware that you will need to be running iOS 10 or higher to be able to reinstall the latest version of Pandora from the App Sto 
The app works well. There are fewer licenses than one would find on other streaming services, but the Pandora algorithm makes for easier hands-off listening (outside of album play, which is identical assuming competing services have the same licenses). My biggest complaint is that the app forgets user tasks (eg, searching a particular artist’s catalogue, playing a particular song on a station, etc.) when backgrounded. It then kicks you back to the “my music” section while auto-launching a new song on the last station played. Quite annoying.
Used to have the free version of pandora and it was ok, went ahead and signed up for the premium version only to be extremely disappointed. The music crashes a lot, I keep on getting the same annoying notification telling me that the radio is not currently available and to choose a different station... no matter what station I choose I get that same annoying notification, so it seems that I’m only paying to get crappier service. Thanks for the waste of money.
Good
Good stuff
Very good I would recommend this app!😁
I enjoy the music that Pandora plays. It’s diverse and right on point!! Each station I choose Pandora is able to match the music to correlate with that exact artist. Thanks so much!
Itaete
Great!!!!
I’m so happy right now because they actually let me play my favorite albums for free and I’ve been wanting to do that for ages and now I can because I wasn’t allowed to buy music so thank you Pandora!!!!😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Too many commercials
Amazing
Pandora help me to love my day, one step up with with it’s great music. Thanks Pandora! 
Great mix of songs, custom channels, great sound quality, awesome experience!

Every time I open pandora it keeps asking me to upgrade to premium. I do not want to upgrade. It feels like a trap. It actually tricked my boyfriend into hitting upgrade when he opened his pandora. Now he has to jump thru hoops to cancel it. It would be nice to see that pop up disappear. A button that says ‘don’t ask again’ would be ideal.
Premium need to be free to be honest
I love it so much I know sometimes you don’t always get what ever song you want but it’s nice too to discover new music and stuff
That's a neat trick making the 'not now' button not work when you force a connect to Facebook for a radio app.

PANDO PICKS THE RIGHT SONGS FOR THE RIGHT MOOD EVERY TIME!!!
There is way to many
Wow!
I was trying to use pandora but i haven't updated it yet and it literally didn't let me listen to anything it kept pausing. I love using this app but that was really annoying. I would like to use this app without having it force me to update it just so i can work.
The the variety of music
I like the music but I want to have a track with a artist and the first song is the actual artist the and the rest are way different artists it gets annoying. Next update can you add that feature where you get the artist you want to listen to.
I know I am using the free version and I do expect some adds, but ever sense the new update all I see are adds. Not only are there giant adds that make me so I can’t even see what song is playing, the adds slow down switching to different stations. Not to mention when an audio add pops up I can no longer skip it after 15 seconds, the adds are full screen and three to four 30 second adds play in a row before a new song plays.
It is amazing listening to all of my favorite songs
I recently updated the app and am unable to use it for more than 15 minutes before it notifies me of an error and stops playing. I should have waited to update and would have, had I know of this issue.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Love my One subscription but needs... 1. LANDSCAPE orientation 2. Full screen album art (iPad)  3. Really throws a random song sometimes  4. iPhone lock screen integration for thumbs up and down 5. More skips for ONE users Still my favorite and most used apps... 
I’m telling all my friends about Pandora Radio I like it.
Really annoying when you write down an artist name and Pandora pops up another and Force you to listen to another one.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Thanks for the feedback. It sounds like you may be interested in our new on-demand service, Pandora Premium!   For more information, please visit: https://www.pandora.com/upgrade  Or if you have any additional questions, feel free to reach out to our supp 
I would like it much better if you would stop interrupting me selecting music to ask if I’m ready to upgrade...With you doing that it has me leaning more towards canceling my account instead of upgrading...
I like the variety of songs that bring every station.
Pandora livens up a snowy winter afternoon!
Plays the same songs a lot, but that is probably due to the only other issue I have with pandora. When usb connected to my truck, the screen changes to black so I can’t see song info or thumb up songs I like.
This is amazing. I can lessen to any other that I want. Though it would be amazing if I could search up a song then get the other through that.
Pandora is LITERALLY everything. From when I’m feeling down to when I’m pumping it up trying to get ready in the bathroom to being the playlist at a party. It never lets me down and always knows what to play. Old school, newly released, everything.. Pandora has it all, and is the ONLY music app I use. Keep it up Pandora.
I pay for my pandora..... but i will say its the best 4 dollars ive ever spent a month... i love it!!!!
Love it!!! Turns my Pioneer Radio into an awesome controller. Can rate thumbs Up or Down with face or speech controls
Super
I love Pandora. And I don’t mind the commercials!
I love how I can create my own radio with a variety of artists, and find new artists I love who are similar to those artists. Pandora Plus was a great choice to buy too! Worth it!!
My pandora kept losing connection no matter where I am (home,work, school) and I’m so sick of it I deleted the app. I tried all the troubleshooting and even making a different account. Nothing. So annoyed and so disappointed.
Enjoy personalized artist play list.  Free is good even with commercials.  🤪 use almost everyday !
I love listening to all music and pandora is such an awesome option.  All music is beautiful music!
...the app crashes the phone while you\'re using navigation. It doesn\'t just crash itself, it actually causes the phone to crash—kicks you out of the phone, as if the OS encountered a crash and you have to enter the password again. Then, you\'re fumbling with navigation while driving, because a major interchange is ahead or you had just a few minutes of navigation left.   No other app does this to me. Ever.   iOS 10 iPhone 7.   Pandora replied to my review to contact support. I don\'t need support. Your app has junk code somewhere. Fix it.   Also, the music variety is a joke. It\'s sometimes stuck in a corner of a sub-genre for days, playing the same crap over and over again, when based on the station\'s seeds the variety should be ridiculously expansive. That\'s what you want people to pay for, right?  My small personal music collection is more varied than that. You had years to fine-tune your service.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I don’t think the skips should be limited
Too many of the same songs
I just found out I’ve been charged multiple times for pandora premium... what the actual f*ck? I did not sign up for premium. Either way, it’s turned to garbage. I bought Plus, to use offline and offline never works and barely connect to my 2018 vehicle.
good app. wish they didn’t shove a subscription down your throat every second but other than that it serves its purpose well. thanks
I have to say that pandora been great till the last two days, I don’t know what’s going on but it’s been acting up and I’m not able to listen to any of my playlists 🙃😔
I just started two new stations and it is working very well I like Pandora a lot
Best music stations app ever - period!!!
Pandora makes the world a happier place I love it, always on point 👍👍👍👍👍!
Been a pandora subscriber for years!  No ads or BS, lots of great music and I hear new stuff All the time instead of the same songs over and over like normal radio. Can't go without it.  Please keep up the great work !!
Sometimes it skips and turns off my phone randomly
Great app, wide selection. I am still stuck on the free trial because I want the compatibility to my pioneer stereo. I remember using the stereo only with aux input, but it offers a little light show if I use pandora. I would use the premium membership if it would actually work and let me select a song when connected to the head unit instead of a black screen that says pandora + pioneer. Upsetting, hope it gets fixed soon, or going back to Spotify.
I used to love Pandora. Now, they have too many ads.   Want to be annoyed, put on a sleep station and sweet the sleep timer. A few minutes in, your tranquil music or sleep sounds will be interrupted by a very loud ad.  Come on!  As I liked and disliked songs, the selection quickly shrank to a short playlist.   I created a playlist for upbeat music. I added a few songs to see it. Next thing I know most music in the station is slow, putting me to sleep. What's wrong with Pandora?  The smart Pandora logic does not seem to recognize that I don't like certain types of voices and lyrical subject matter. The Pandora logic seems to be is all about the artist first and sound second. They need to consider voices, instruments and lyrics that I like and dislike. Also, I don't mind beliefs that are different from mine, but I listen to music to relax. I like pop but don't want to hear songs about sleeping around.  I like Christian music that doesn't put me to sleep, but not rap or metal. Chris Tomlin's faster songs like Sing Sing Sing are great. Pandora also seems to put too much weight on the artist. Because I like one Toby Mac, doesn't mean I like the sound of all his songs. He has a few good ones and a bunch of junk. I feel like giving a thumbs up to some artists destroys my playlist. 
I have had Pandora plus for a couple years now and all of a sudden there’s an ad. I don’t understand why I’m paying my $4.99 a month to avoid ads and then they pop up anyway, what Gives?
Continues to improve its selection of “my kind of music!” Thanks!
I have plus. Every time I open the app I have a pop up begging me to upgrade to premium. Every time. Even if I open the app multiple times a day.
Pandora is the best all the choices I love pandora but the adds are annoying...
No problems with it what so ever
Awesome
Love Pandora! Such a great app to listen and to be introduced to good music! Plays the music you love to listen often!
Have used this app for several years now. Not once have I been disappointed! Music feeds the soul and pandora is always on point!
Loving it!
Worked flawlessly until now!  Fix it please as we pay $10 a month
I think this is a great app . Thanks
Keeps bumping into an Error that keeps the music in pause until I re start my phone. iPhone 8+
please stop asking me to spend 12$ a month i already pay for advertising free.  apple music and amazon i would use if i wanted 12 buck month of tailored music.  be true to yourself your a awesome interactive radio like others .  The when it pops up to ask i go to x out and the icon flashes there and i touch try. grrr. sorry your a great Radio system the Best!!!  i guess that’s why I am so picky.  pandora your the best intuitive Radio!! ever!! keep up the good work. 
All !!!!
Too many ads
We always have people over on the weekends and we always out pandora on. It’s our “go to” app for a great time and of course for music!!
Too much advertisements!!!
One star because I was tired of it popping up and I wanted to clear it
I can get all of the music I love and it has good quality music
To be honest, I don’t love all the commercials, but they need to make money somehow, right? If I don’t want them, I can pay to upgrade. No big deal. But I love all the stations, and the “thumbs up” and “thumbs down” options!!
Awesome
good stuff
I don’t understand how this app can be so buggy.  Crashes more than is functional, songs randomly skip halfway through, ads play mid songs, or ads never load and app crashes.  Music continues to play when headphones are removed from my device, which I find to be highly inappropriate app behavior.  The amount of times pop ups come up when I’m trying to find stations is appalling. The ads only load when I’m about to touch the screen, forcing a redirect or the app tries to charge me for premium.  Honestly, if this app is so unstable and unusable, why would I ever want to pay for premium? 
Ok so Pandora is a really good app , but there are just so many adds and it gets really annoying , another thing is that the music is stopping a lot lately , whenever i go to other apps it stops , and i really don’t like that , but other than this it’s an ok app !
I don't want to upgrade, stop bugging every time I load the app. It's not even every initial launch, it is every f'ing time I look at my music. Which genius in your team thought this is a good idea?
Upgraded to plus recently, but could do with built in EQ options. Would definitely increase the listening experience.
too many commercials
Pandora is hitting please keep up the good job cool Thanks
I love the app but I wish we had more skips
I get that you're trying to shove the paid pandora down our throats but I don't appreciate sitting through 2 minuets worth of ads for just 2 to 3 songs. That's absurd.
Pandora works hard to play the music I love & for that I’m thankful! 😊😘
Had pandora plus, my subscription just ended a few days earlier than a month. I’ve had pandora so long, but often lately it seems like I keep having subscription errors on their end.   Support suggested I get a new subscription through pandora instead of the App Store. Responded that we should address the current problem first, rather than start paying for more. The rep offered a “free week” of plus, essentially giving me what I paid for. Solution was fair, but going to try a different app for awhile. Just not interested in doing this every other month  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

So many music app available at much cheaper price. You need lower prices.
I love Pandora. For the past decade, Pandora has tirelessly served the perfect song for every mood. When I first ran across Pandora, I was giddy with excitement. I no longer had to spend hours to find just the right song; Pandora did all the work for me.  BUT...  The Pandora application is clingy! This morning, it asked me if I loved it, and I told it to leave me alone.  Less than five minutes later, the application came slinking back over; “do you love me”?  After repeated and ignored requests for space (over and over), I may be forced to do something I do not wish to do. This will probably hurt me more than it hurts Pandora, but I cannot continue a relationship with a partner that has such disregard for my need for space, personal dignity, and wishes. Goodbye Pandora! I will have to return to the song desert, finding a refreshing song only at an oasis here and there, but at least then I will be treated with respect. 
2 thumbs up 👍🏽👍🏽!
Love it!!!
I pay to not get adverts and I still get spoken adverts for new artists in between my music.  I don’t want ANY adverts which is why I pay to not have them!!! Otherwise I love this app.
2/17/2918 Update- PREMIUM STILL NOT AVAILABLE ON IPAD APP!   0 Stars for you.  Embarrassing this has not been added to the app  This iPad app STILL has no ability to search for a single song and play it.  And the UI is horrendous when compared to the competitors.  Pandora is doomed. 
Everyday when I first start Pandora after being closed out Pandora shuts down after the 3rd song every time. I have to restart of course and once it restarts it picks up start with the song it closes out on (starts from beginning). Once this sequence happens it won’t occur again during continuous play BUT once I close out Pandora then restart it happens AGAIN. Please fix this
es regular uno busca una cancion y nola en cuentra o pone otra eso deve de mejorar
Jesus is awesome!!! Thanks Pandora🙏🏽
Good music
Far too many ads, notifications, and unnecessary contacts to justify spending $14 on strictly audio content when Netflix offers auditory and visual stimulation for less. Unless of course the company is targeting low income demographics with limited data, and monopolizing on their limited choices.
I like Spotify better its cheaper and much more user friendly!
When I try to get into one of my stations the station will play for 3 seconds and then a tab will pop up saying that the station is not available and to go to another one so I did and I tryed this with all the stations and it still is not working. I turned off my phone, logged out and back into my account and still nothing  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing!

Ever since the last update I am getting music and songs that are not even close to the genre I have playing. I’m getting jazz and rock songs even though my playlist is new country. What’s up with that. Fix this cause I keep skipping songs that are not songs I want to listen to
The ads in this app are out of control. There’s ads at least after every two songs. And worse yet it’s not one ad anymore, it’s multiple. And a lot of them are from pandora explaining they wouldn’t be screwing you out of your music with this ad if you had bought premium. Bunch of money hungry pencil pushers.
I want pandora plus, but instead of clicking pandora plus, I now pay $21 for a function that is useless, I just don’t want ads. I tried navigating to find out how I can downgrade but I just keep getting links to pages longer than my 9 week English research assignment. The links are very evasive by hiding my solution in massive piles of text I don’t care for reading. I just want to listen to my favorite music without having to listen to advertisements.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble.

You guys don’t allow the listener to actually determine if he or she likes the artis playlist before he or she runs out of skips and is forced to change the station
Love it
You guys should keep doing what your doing providing a free music to the people. Thats all goodbye. Thank you for asking for my opinion
I was happy a few years ago. Upon returning as a paying customer, I had no idea how much Pandora had improved. My thanks to you is that I let Friends & Family listen and they all join and seem much happier people because of it. Thank You Pandora! Please keep up the good work and I will happily run my mouth about it.
At first I was going to give you 3 stars and then complain about the ads then I realized that I should be saying “thank you”. I can listen to any music of my choosing for free but I just need to listen to an ad here and there. Thank you Pandora!!
It freezes up. I can’t pause, move forward or play without trying several times . This never happened while I paid , now that I’m back on the free service it’s messing up. I guess that’s why.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I pay for Pandora Plus, and I have used Pandora since it started as a geeky experiment more than a decade ago, and I loved it until last week.  Suddenly, it has started popping up sign up screens for their Premium subscription EVERY time I open my phone or unlock the screen.  They put the “Not Now” button right next to the sign up button, and make it much smaller.  It is hard not to hit Sign Up by mistake.  That is just dirty marketing and I am disgusted.  If they don’t knock it off in the next couple days, I am cancelling my subscription.
Great
Nice
To many commercials thank you
My stations wouldn’t work, I said some very bad words, and then I accidentally knocked over a bottle of nail polish remover and it spilled all over me and got in my hair and a little got in my eye, and I had to flush it out. in other words, this app is bad luck and potentially harmful when it doesn’t work. Lol
I love this song cause it is amazing i love Sofia Carson and all the Descents songs!!!🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😍😘
I’ve had pandora for several years now and I love. Being able to listen to any song I want at anytime is amazing.
I cannot give up Pandora! Easiest app to use, customize playlists, skip along listening to awesome stations! Love, love, love Pandora!
This app is fantastic; tremendous scope for our specific playlists, and for free! Join right away!
This an is Awesome app
Gives the best variety of music! Also introduces new music of the genre you selected which i loveee. When im looking for a radio station I use this over Apple Music and IHeartRadio
Its like having my very own DJ in my pocket. Pandora makes my hips sway back & forth to the tune & dance like a fool all by myself in my room & thats OK its my own Party! Thanks Pandora.
Perfect for long road trips!! Love it!
LOVE IT!!
If you love music this app is pretty good. I also use Spotify, they are both good !.!..!
I just feel there is too many commercials. Yes I know I can pay for commercial free but not $10 a month!
I love it best by far
Have Sirius radio & often find myself connecting to Pandora fir music my-way.
I’ve been leaning on Pandora to help broaden my musical horizons for years, and my Thumbprint radio proves it. My favorite mix of my favorite genres and it always manages to sneak something new in that I love that I’ve never heard before!

Kept asking me to rate and leave a review so I did
It’s awesome but you should be able to pick your songs for free. That’s why Spotify is cooler.
I have loved Pandora for years. Would like the premium to create favorites but not go $13 a month.   Thanks for all the years of music 
I upgraded to pandora premium yesterday and it’s awesome, I can simply search for my favorite songs, the only thing that bothers me is that it’s makes the front and back of my iphone HOT where the battery is, I’ve never had this issue until I upgraded yesterday
Love it
Excellent way to enjoy music
The greatest since sliced bread!!!
Free Pandora has dropped off why would I want an upgrade on a degrading product.  Shame used to love it
I love Pandora and even started paying for a subscription so I didn’t have to hear ads but now they are trying to get me to pay more so I can choose the exact song to listen to? Why are there 2 tiers of subscriptions? I don’t care that much about choosing the exact song. If it’s that “important” I’ll use YouTube. But why not just give people more bang for their buck so that they’ll tell everyone to subscribe? Beats me
UGH ads!! Probably there might be a better app than this...app there’s more ads than music itself UGH so annoying !! Gosh! And people probably waste money to have ad -free service and when I dislike a song it plays other station same song and same song I disliked not only that but the advertisements they effing provide that’s why you have to put your gender and zip code like it matters( which it doesn’t) but I do like that at least they provide the one hour  in uninterrupted listening
Overall, I really enjoy Pandora. I’m cheap so I just use the free version and deal with the annoying ads(which are incredibly annoying, but like I said I’m cheap so I realize it’s my choice to deal with it). However, lately it’s been crashing at least once during every listening period. It’s getting to the point where I’m just done with it and probably going to have to see what else is out there. Every time they come out with a new update it claims to address the issues with the crashing and yet nothing has been done, if anything it crashes more often for me now. Pandora, FIX THIS ISSUE.
Love to listen to music and love pandora
Your choice to listen to feel good music. Old school or New school!! No matter your mood, you create your own vibes by creating your own playlist. 💽💿📀🎶🎵
The app freezing quite often even when I’m not listening in HD or whatever. It’s extremely annoying.
I don’t have premium, but I like Pandora a lot! You can replay the songs and  they have a lot of different types of music. I’ve heard music that I haven’t heard in a long time that I like on Pandora. I use Spotify a lot and get frustrated with it more. Pandora is definitely my favorite out of the two. I only really use Spotify because the have the music I want— but so doesn’t Pandora! Keep doing what your doing.
It’s awesome.
I love Pandora! I can take myself to any yr. in time with the great selections!

I signed up for Pandora Plus so I could listen to stations offline while I’m running. I do a lot of trail running so my cell service can be very spotty. However the stations I listen to while running are not part of the top 4 stations I listen to. I think you should give people the option to choose their offline stations.
Why do I have to pick a station every single time I leave the app for a few minutes? I paused it for 3 min to go into the gas station and came out and had to restart the station and lost the song I was listen to at the time. It is quite annoying. I use to love this app but I may have to start using Spotify if this doesn’t get fixed. Please fix this issue
Great app. Picks some artists that are not even close to what I started listening to but overall does a good job. Changing subscriptions is difficult, for some reason mine kept reverting back to premium.
Do you know how an app looses notification privileges? When the app used notifications to send ads...  Pandora is now blocked from sending me notifications.
I live Pandora because it automatically selects the music you like to play. The only annoying thing are the loud commercials they add in between plays. I don’t mind commercials but I do mind when they increase the volume a lot. It is annoying when you are in the office with visitors. That’s why I just stream classical music from the radio.
Love pandora
Need to fix the shutting down issue. Quite often I have to uninstall and reinstall. Pretty frustrating!
Excellent
The app is pretty good and plays decent mixes. It doesn’t play covers the way Spotify does. It does lack an equalizer. That is the reason that I continue to use Spotify as an alternative.
I’ll be listening to music and every so often it just shuts my phone off (only app I use that this ever happens with) and then loads back up and brings me to my lock screen. Then once I get back to Pandora I push play and it begins the song I was listening to over again. It’s just a bug because this has never happened before
Everywhere I go I can enjoy my music.
This is a very good music source. The free version is great and the upgrade is exception
You are always my go to music app. But PLEASE make some changes. First, I cannot tell you how much I need you to make Premium available on desktop. Please. I’m begging you. The only other thing is the Questlove Supreme podcast. It’s phenomenal but always starts up back at the beginning if I stop listening before the end. The iOS app itself, though is fantastic. Premium is almost worth it and a desktop app would make it worth it. I have tried Tidal, Apple Music, Spotify, and Amazon Music in the last few months and no one gets me better than Pandora. The music genome project is second to none.  Update: It’s Here!!!!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!! 
This app is dumb I bought the premium and it lasted a week for 20 dollars I want my money back
I love pandora because it plays a whole bunch of songs and you can just skip one if you don’t like it and you can give the songs thumbs up so pandora will play it more!
I appreciate listening to my Pandora daily There are a lot of smart cookies that choose how to organize the music line up! Thanks!!!!! 
I give it a 3 due to it being SO repetitive with their song choices. I usually listen to Pandora on the same station before heading into the work, and it just plays the same songs (with a few “new” ones added). It’s super annoying. I use the thumb option to better specify what I like, I don’t want to hear the SAME stuff though. It’s like Pandora is being lazy as crap lol.
Can you make the click area larger for the play button that is on the right of each listed song or station?  You have to be precise or it will take you into the submenu. 
Love it always has what I want
I would give Pandora 5 stars if it weren’t for the frequency of song repetition...
I wish there was a way to thumbs up or down when the phone is locked/from the notification bars etc. sometimes I don't have time to go in and open the app to thumbs up a song when I'm trying to protect a station.
It's Great Love It
Always a good time listening to Pandora
Precuim has everything sad part is you have to pay for what you get! I wish you could create your own playlists. You  have great potential but it’s kinda upsetting. On the radio  you can call in and request a song here you can’t.. you may understand why I’m upset!  I love listening to artists but it’s quite upsetting having constant ads and why not unlimited skips I want to listen to music not watch ads!   Q.Can  you change songs so they don’t have bad words?!   Q. Can you make it so that you can play songs without WiFi or data   Because my favorite place to listen to music is the park but sadly there is no WiFi there! 
How do I cancel my subscription I didn’t mean to purchase!?!?!
I soooooo enjoy listening to Pandora! It allows you to choose your music genre and plays the songs from the era - both old and new skool!! Wouldn’t know what I would do without Pandora on my phone!
Pandora constantly reboots itself every time I stop listening to it for a few minutes. If I’m listening to something and I have to pause it,when I start it again,my current song stops playing while Pandora resets itself and my current song is gone,and something else starts playing. Who wants premium if your normal app won’t play right. My iPhone6 is catching the vapors.
Too many adds
Monthly subscriber for years. Ever since the introduction of Pandora Premium, song selections for mere Pandora One users have been poor. It’s obvious they’re steering people to upgrade yet again by playing songs that are discounted for Pandora. And from the user’s perspective, those songs are discounted for a reason. I unsubscribed for failure to maintain consistency.
Love it !! Keeps me happy all day ❤️
I love pandora
Your Vast ocean of music is the top, May I Ask to be a volunteer team member to grow, and become outstanding?  This is how much I’m in awe of Pandora.  Thank you for letting me share.  Anthony Dozier (Paint Artist) 
I got this app to listen to my favorite songs and as I was signing up I saw the zip code box. I clicked why and it said they would not share it with anyone. Like heck I would trust pandora with my zip code. Please make the zip code a option then maybe I give a better review.
do not update to the most recent version. if you use pandora on your phone with carplay in your car DO NOT UPDATE because it will not work. they did it again messing up the control buttons on the phone screen. usually when i plug my phone to my car via usb pandora will automatically come on and play the last song i was listening to. but with the recent update it does not work anymore and you cannot control pandora from the iphone home control center. this is the second time they did this. they fixed it with the last update but with this recent update it reverted back to not working again. so if you use pandora carplay the i recommend not updating or you will regret it.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Update the stations with better music
I was in YouTube for ten years trying to find the best music app and then I found it, (this one.)
It’s the best!!!!!!!!!!
I love this app so mych💖
LOVE PANDORA!! Its the best for music selections ...
Every time I am doing homework or is on a walk I get my headphones and listen to my fav songs and if they r not my fav songs I can just skip it and I won’t care for the commercials, if they r not less than 30 seconds.Anyways I just wanted to say thank u for having my fav songs in this little app😍❤️🔥🎶🎵📱
Good
I do hear a lot of the same songs however the service is worth.  All music and no one talking (Too often that is)
I love it but why does it keep crashing????!!!!
Pic me up
I’ve used pandora for years now, always loved the app and chose it over Spotify and others. And like the majority of their listeners I do not subscribe. I never thought the ads were overbearing and I understand their significance, obviously. But, fir the last 2-3 months maybe a little longer even they have DRASTICALLY increased the volume of advertisements. I use the app everyday several times a day and it has taken a lot to get to to think I should move to another music app, however, that is just what I am on the brink of. Had that never changed they’re a five star app.
I have a lot of issues with the app running while my phone is locked. I does not display what is playing, or if it does display it then I can’t use the skip or pause button. Sometimes I have to close the app entirely to pause or stop the music. And I pay for my subscription!!!
Thank you
I understand it’s free music, but the ads are way too loud.
I’ve been paying for Pandora plus for a few years now; only because I hate ads. Things worked fine until Pandora rolled out the premium service at which point they started advertising their premium service which requires interaction to make it go away. I did email about this but got no response so I’m cancelling my service today and moving to another service.
It’s straight
Pandora was great before it started demanding that you start the premium every two songs. Not to mention the fact that it plays what seems like the same ten songs over and over, whether or not I’ve thumbs upped it.   I miss the days when you could listen for more than two hours at a time too.  I’d be more likely to try the premium trial if it didn’t automatically charge you after the 30 days is up. But pandora kinda ruins it by telling you to try it at least 50 times a day. This app has really gone downhill in my opinion. I’m not trying to pay $12 a month for something so annoying. 
Friendly piece of advice to developers, knock off the notification abuse. If I can't seamlessly use your app it is crap. Stop being a high school principal and telling me that you know better than me on how to interact with my device. Just write lightweight well-thought-out modular software. Enough stroking your ego, you are not coding Mission control.
I had Pandora as 5 stars, but just dropped them to 3 stars. The reason I moved them down 2 stars because of the commercials. I paid to not have to listen to advertisements, and now I’m starting to get them. Subscription — canceled!!!
Just can’t live without it- it makes me happy when I’m doing dishes (without a dishwasher and a family of six!)
Im a six grader, i have a iPhone and this app is fine on my phone but on my iPad when I’m at school i cant listen to music because it says ‘buffering your station will be right back’ and no its not right back. It’s not the connection becasue I always have three lines and everything else works except this freakin app. I HATE this. All i want to do is listen to freakin music.
They keep bugging me constantly over there reviews. I can care less about the reviews and the stuff is an all that perfect in comparison to my iTunes account. So I’ll just give them a single stars a little shut them up
This music app is so good that I feel guilty using it every day because I haven't subscribed to the premium part of it yet. I think I will soon, though. In the mean time, I've been using Pandora for many years and it's honestly a big part of my life. Like most of you, I depend on music for happiness, inspiration, and as a reminder to me that I'm a human being blessed with the ability to make the world a better place. Pandora is awesome and irreplaceable.
I really loved this app up until recently. I was playing the Black eyed Peas radio and in an hr it played only one black eyed peas song. It also was playing country. Pretty sure that’s not related to my station.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble with your station!

Was working perfect this morning and now I open the app it’s frozen and then it crashes backs me out of the app to my home screen. I’ve turned off my phone restated the phone and app made sure the app was updated and nothing is working now I’m paying for an app I can’t use.
It’s Litty !!!
I get that you need commercials but stop being so greedy with them
Too many adds, adds. They are everywhere.
Just simply amazing 😁
I listen to it everyday! Always for any occasion!
I love the flexibility to switch genres at will.
Some videos are four stomachs deep leav them that way
Love this station
Love it
I enjoy pandora so much because I get to listen to all my favorite stations 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
I love pandora and it gives me my favorite songs
I’ve been using Pandora for around2 years now and it’s still the best music app I have. I would like to mention one thing though; unless the app is force-closed, it tends to play at completely random times throughout the day. I was at the lowest volume during a (loud) class and the app had been draining my battery when it started itself. This isn’t me tapping it on accident or anything, in fact the app started while I was sitting there watching a YouTube video. Fix please ;) 
Lately I’ve been having issues with the Pandora apps on couple different devices. On my iPhone, the app will freeze up periodically and go unresponsive. It also runs into issues while casting and will becoming disconnected from the device even though the phone hasn’t moved or changed networks. When this happens the phone starts playing a different song from the speakers and I have to re-cast to the speakers to get everything lined out.  On my Android TV, the app seems to be constantly running and will occasionally play music out of nowhere, there doesn’t appear to be a way to exit the app. 
I pay to not hear ads and they still play ads. Sure it’s ads for music but it’s still an ad dang it!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry about this!

I love Pandora but I hate how often the ad for fifty shades of grey comes up. It’s not appropriate and I have it on at home and work. I don’t like having to close or pause Pandora when that obscene ad!
It was my husbands and my song. He passed away 2 years ago. Please play it more!
Pandora is the best !!💛 maybe the best app to get to listen to your music help pandora out and download pandora thanks ! From myaaaaa
Why won’t ya let me have replays for some songs? If u say because of license then SCREW YOU!!!!!!😃—>😡—>😤—>🤬—>🖕🏻🤬🖕🏻
Cool
Awesome
Pandora provides music for my every mood and vibe throughout the hectic day...and night! Everything from Mozart to Erykah Badu...and without commercial interruption!  Thanks Pandora!!! 
My issues with it is you can only skip if you only by the premium feature thing.
Awesome music forever

I enjoy being able to set up different stations so I can adjust my listening needs to my moods.
🔥🔥👌
Even when the app isn’t open in the background it will start to play. I put it in offline mode to help minimize the data usage.

I understand them having commercials. That’s the price you pay for such a great free product, and most of the time I hardly notice them. However, if I’m listening to something soft and relaxing like the Solo Piano or Relaxation stations the commercials almost knock me out of my chair they’re so so much louder than the music. Destroys the mood totally.
VERY NICE APP
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
What I like: You get unlimited stations which are personalized to you.  What I Hate: Their only goal is to make you want Premium. How it usually ends up going is I listen to great music I love for about 20-30 min. Then they start playing the most RANDOM songs that have NOTHING to do with the station I am listening to. Then, I have to waste my time watching an ad to get skips. Then after I have earned my skips, O have to waste them 👎ing the random songs they play that I have never even heard of and don’t even like. This repeats until I’m like, “might as well listen to Amazon or Google Play music.” Pandora, I’m disappointed in you. 
Previously I was an iHeart listener, but listened to my family’s jamming on Pandora and I switched over. I am a non-paying member, but am considering a membership if the ads are true for less than $5.00, I can join???
Love playing whatever I want whenever I want. Love the track mixes Pandora serves up while I do other things.
I love hearing different music from what’s on my phone but the horrible commercials interrupting the music are unbearable.
I love pandora but the commercials repeat themselves. I don’t mind two commercials in between my songs but when it’s the same commercial repeating itself it becomes annoying. Plus it use to be only one commercial in between a few songs now it’s always two.
Love it! ❤️
I’ve been a PLUS member for quite some time now, but for some reason my unlimited skip function is not working. I skip a few songs and then it tells me I have no more skips remaining. REALLY!!??  Really debating going to Apple Music or Spotify. This is ridiculous.

Great music
I really appreciate Pandora! They have consistently offered the best music at no cost to listeners for many years! I’ve had my account for at least 7 years now. I call them “clutch music” because i have always had difficulties sleeping, and I rely on them to help me fall asleep. They finally stopped sending me the, “Are you still listening? We don’t pay to play to an empty room” warnings! I listen to the best of Gospel 85% of the time, General R&B 8% of the time, relaxing sounds 2% of the time, and guilty pleasure (cough, Trey Songz station) 5% of the time! Haha
To many commercials

Aside from the constant repeats of the same songs I have experienced issues with my Pioneer CD Player when trying to stream pandora. Every other update seems to fix the issue only for the next update to completely ruin it again. When I plug the phone it is says “err-19”, “check-app”, or “paused”. I have to manually close pandora and open it again. Normally when I plug my phone in it automatically loads pandora, but lately it’s been a pain hassling with the phone while driving. I’ve tested cables as well as different iPhones and can verify this is a bug inside the app.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Free Music
I’d like to see them pay artists more.
Would be the go-to music app but now sometimes you will get one song between three ads.
I like the app. It plays most of the music I like. I get no music interruptions between songs. Plus. It’s free
The oldies choices are fantastic!!!!
I used to love this app, but lately it’s worthless.  I have had this app for years and I pay $3.99 a month for no ads which is great, when the app decides to work. EVERY single time I workout (which is 6 days a week) the app shuts down, goes off line, buffers, pick something and it happens. Not only that but random times throughout the day music will just start playing and the app isn’t even open! I guess you get what you pay for!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I listen on my phone at work, in my car and in my house it’s the best
I’ve been using Pandora since 2009. Since 2009 I’ve created 100 playlist which had my perfect mixture of songs. I already pay for Tidal but wanted to try a service that has stations (which Tidal doesn’t). So I recently decided to upgrade to Pandora Premium and BOOM! All my playlist GONE!!!! If I can’t get them back, I’m gone forever. I spent years liking and disliking songs and creating stations. Won’t put another 9 years into a music app. And if I have to downgrade to the free version to get my playlist back....so be it. My work is more important than unlimited skips.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Good  very good
I have been using Pandora music for years now. Even when I’ve been overseas and have had to use a VPN service (despite a USA billing address), I have continued to remain a loyal customer. I have Pandora Plus. Pandora keeps asking me to try premium. I do not want to try premium. I’m sick of every time opening the app and having to click “no thank you.” Change your app to quit asking paying subscribers to upgrade or I will cancel my service.
Hate how they don't update songs. This app keeps playing the oldest songs ughh so annoyinggggggg 
Pandora will play a song and in the middle of the song, the song cuts off and changes to a different song so I don’t get to hear the entire song sometimes and it’s been happening too often 😪  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Edit: February 2018 - it\'s been months and several updates and the App still can play no more than 4 songs before crashing. On the upside, it\'s no longer taking everything on my phone down with it. However much I loath the idea of starting over with another service, this is ridiculous and I\'m switching to something else.   I\'m not sure how the last update was supposed to fix crashes, because mine didn\'t crash before the update and now constantly does. Worse yet, it seems to restart my phone- so I lose everything else running too, like GPS! It\'s one thing to not work, it\'s another to cause everything else to not work too. Hopefully it\'ll be fixed soon, because it\'s otherwise a great service.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I love pandora plays what I want to hear. Satellite radio is painful same crap music. I wish Pandora was satellite fed I would pay monthly fee to have good music everywhere I go.
I love this! It’s just what I was looking for! 💜☺️
The best musics app ever I listen to it all the time
Great
The app for the most part works great, but i feel that there really should be a ( like ) (dislike) button on the lock screen so i dont have to constantly have to unlock my phone and go to the app when i want to like/ dislike tracks
I love pandora it’s great every thing I could ask for except I can’t find my shuffle feature after update. I have to switch stations manually you can do that when your driving. Please where is my shuffle feature.
Music out standing!!
Pandora Thumbprint Radio is GREAT! When a song plays you give it a thumbs up or down—-you really choose the songs that you want to hear!
Nothing better to use!!
love it!!But some I can play unless I put station and when I do I still can’t!!!!! I can’t handle it!!!😰Otherwise I LOVE IT!! I’m so glad u got pentatonic!!
This is filled with music
I love making my radio stations 🤙 
La mejor 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😁😁😁😉😉
Even with minimal commercials you’ll love this app they nailed what radio should be through and through
Pandora Plus promises an \"ad-free\" service, yet I still get spammed with ads to upgrade to Pandora Premium. With this latest update, it happens even more frequently! I\'m paying $5/month specifically to avoid ads, which should include ads for Pandora itself.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

No good!!!
In Pandora we trust. It’s like she talks to you. All you have to do is just listen.
I am a paying “plus” customer and I don’t want premium... why offer it everyday? Maybe offer once and give the option to dismiss permanently. I feel like I am back on a ad based service. It covers the screen until you dismiss it, and it’s back the next time you login.
There is an ad every 2 songs. This is just way too much. Pandora has just become a stingy company who are getting more greedy for money. They even play back to back commercials. Their is literally two 30 second commercials playing back to back. I might as well listen to the radio since there is fewer interruptions. Instead of giving us so many ads why don't you guys make the ad companies pay more. I also got an email that said I have a limited amount of free hours left. Not everyone has money to pay for the monthly subscription. This is terrible. I have had enough with pandora. I am going to find another source for my music. Put some new music too. The selection of music stays the same. Pandora is boring now and full of greedy people. Pandora plays an ad every other song. And they play back to back commercials. Go to SPOTIFY. It has a better price and worth the value. Terrible app!

I absolutely love Pandora! I can pick out my songs & make my own channels! Great for road trips!
I love pandora, and obviously ads are a part of its being free, but I wish they could suit the ads to the station. I just love being woken up or distracted from studying by a voice literally screaming in my ear on my chill station. Otherwise, happy listener!
😍Love!
I signed up for pandora so I would get ads. Recently they keep asking me to upgrade so I won’t get ads.

Great
My " go to" place for music. Love how easy it is to use, stream, hassle- free music. I love that I can choose any genre that suits my mood and listen uninterrupted when I choose to. Love! Pandora! Turn up the music and dance! 
Pretty easy to use with VoiceOver. Nice variety of music, new and old.
Just select your favorite artist and.....  JUST PUSH PLAY 🎵 
Stop asking me to connect Facebook and upgrade!  I’m in the no commercials upgrade. I don’t want to pick my music or I would’ve stayed with Spotify. I also have no interest in connecting to Facebook. I have to clear it out every time I turn Pandora on.
Recently pandora has made a few changes to their app and not for the better!  I have been a pandora user for over 5+ years now and the recent changes have made me want to switch to another platform. The way they lay out the stations are all messed up, it makes impossible to add or alter current stations with artists or songs you like.  Pandora needs to quit tinkering with the app. If it’s not broke don’t fix it because the changes are never for the better! 
I’m a paying member but can’t add variety on the app so my stations play the same few pieces over and over. I love pandora but there are thousands of similar artists; get some! I’m tired of skipping.
Not only do you sometimes get 2 commercials for 1 song, but the commercials are louder than the music. So I should pay so that you stop being a pest? I don’t reward bullying, sorry.
I have had Pandora now for about 3 years and it is amazing! Pandora lets you even start your own free trail with Pandora Premium!! I find Pandora to be very relaxing and just fun for me to sit down and be able to listen to my favorite music when I’m relaxing and on road trips!!
😬😬
👍👍💜
Good music
Great variety, amazing genres & outstanding flow!
I really like Pandora, especially the premium services without the adds as I can also replay songs I like.   I’ve found a couple issues recently though, with Apple CarPlay if I’m playing a song and then pause it and plug it back into the car the channels won’t load and I have to fully close out the app and relaunch it to get it working again. The other thing is when I’m casting it to my tv (with Chromecast) it’ll keep playing on the tv, but when I wake my phone up it starts playing a new song (while the channel is still casting). Sometimes it will reconnect others I’ll have to disconnect and reconnect to the tv (while it’s still playing). And then I can’t see the history on my phone to go back and like the songs I heard over that time. 
Great music every time !
It’s an amazing app I really like it I would like it to be better
Prefer YouTube. Not as many commercials.
Discovered a lot of new music with app which has changed my life. But a couple of things that annoy me. When I turn I the app the music starts to play immediately. I would think if you shut down it down it would set to pause automatically, other streaming apps have this. I looked in the prefs and didn’t see anything to control that. And I noticed that some songs that I like, I can’t list to anymore. They changed to station only.
Great appp. But please, Change the way to buy the premium subscription. It show the touch id too fast and I didn’t notice I keep the finger on it (trying to cancel and it was activated). It should have a confirmation by press ok other buttons
I really enjoy using your app. Other than fine-tuning stations to hear different genres of music depending on the situation, I can find new songs that I had never heard of and expand my knowledge of music. Even without paying anything, the app isn’t too exclusive to only premium users (except that now free users can’t listen to song demos anymore :( ). Sometimes it is difficult to create a station to fit your intentions, but after several months, it gets easier. Keep up the good work!
Would be great if we could control volume by dial on watch rather than the way it is currently!
This is awesome music and I love it
Love it
4 iPad, please fix. App doesn't open to play. Even to see a selection. Nota, screen just goes bk to previous home screen .  It was 5*  I had to re download the app to wk correctly. All set!  New update, I had plus package & it is interesting on how I hear the same song w in some hours, u would think world wide we would not be repeating songs. I cancelled out. I-heart & Spotify so far are more go to apps. Good smooth Jazz options on pandora, not enough songs. Unfortunately... 
I love making my own stations, my music.
50yrs. old! Still got that PMA!
What else is there to say!
there are so many ads now. Also, with so many bad songs, 5-6 skips is useless when it takes 3-4 to find a suitable song.    (btw, Pandora, you should do something like "Free Skip Friday")  You ought to care for your users.
I like pandora it’s a really awesome app but I hate the commercials
Pandora is AMAZING!
I like it but it says bad words I want it clean
THIS APPO NEEDES A COMPLETE USER INTERFACE REDESIGN!! The user interface for this app has not changed in over three years. The code is still the same and the application’s speed is greatly affected by the ancient user interface and application design. There is lag on every button you press and songs will constantly buffer no matter how good the Internet connection is. Their user interface is absolutely horrible and it looks like it is an unfinished design. There is no reason why this application should still be the exact same it was three years ago. I fee like I go back in time when I use this app.   Incredibly shocked that this app has five stars. Please rate the application not the premium service! 
I have had Pandora plus for forever and keep getting notices for a free trial to upgrade to Pandora Premium. I want to switch to premium but unfortunately, because years ago I had an Android Phone when I signed up for a paid subscription, I am not able to upgrade to premium. I am not able to upgrade account via Pandora’s mobile site. And I am not able to upgrade via App Store because I do not get billed through the App Store. I also am not able to upgrade on Google Plays website. So basically to upgrade I will have to buy a phone that supports the google play app just to upgrade to Premium??

Nice app to have
Excellent!!! Love Pandora !!
Love the app, but I wish you would bring back the alphabetical station sort on the mobile version. #disappointed and frustrating
You can pick any musician, but the same songs play over and over.
I love the selection under each station! Good job Pandora!
😍
Always finding new songs that I love along with all the originals I want to listen to mixed in!
I love it! I can listen to all my favorite music in one playlist 😍❤️ 
Lo. Mejor
Makes me put my information in it so I can play some music when I could go to YouTube and listen to music free no sign no b.s           I don't want to put my zip code and stuff in 
My biggest issue is that the app automatically starts playing whatever you were listening to last whenever you open the app
I love the variety. There are some stations that I have been listening to since 2010. Great children’s lullaby music that still makes me think of my kids as babies.
It’s good for about 10 minutes then it plays songs that are like the ones I disliked I literally have 300 dislikes and 100 likes
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
It’s really good and I love it
It seems that my music goes quite for a while and it isn’t paused so yea please fix this
Awesome but ads can get annoying
God
I love it !!!!!!
Plays the same songs over and over every hour...  Plays songs in different languages...  Continuously plays songs you DON’T like or even want to listen to 
Stop asking me to review your app
Why can’t I thumbs up and down from the locked screen?    Also, consider being able to choose music based on beats and tempos. EX: fitradio app 
Great
Amazing collection of songs. Especially all the fringe bands and many obscure songs and bands. Get the upgrade with no ads, well worth the money.
Pandora needs to check on their ads. There’s this scam advertisement for hair loss called “forhims” i hear very often; I checked reviews on it and there’s nothing but complaints about it. Pandora needs to stop taking the money from scammers and protect their customers
Great free music
Need to add more songs and newer songs
I have been a premium subscriber for a long time. I LOVE my Pandora. $14.99 per month is now ridiculous.
I love most of the songs played and I’m making some great play lists.
I love pandora.. I can’t get to sleep without pandora 😍
I don’t have pandora premium, but I can preview it for 30 minuets. I love that❤️❤️
Pandora has stepped their game up 😉
I love pandora it has all my favorite songs and I love ti dance to them.But sometimes I wish I could skip whenever I wanted
I don’t enjoy any other aspect of my smart phone as much as my Pandora app. I’m able to listen to anything I want, creat stations as I find new artists I like and go back to a station I once enjoyed because Pandora reminds me. Music foody must-have !
I love that I can listen to music 🎶 I can't get on the radio anymore! It might data me, but I prefer songs I can understand the words to!🤗💕.    That was then and this is now!!!  I can’t get it to continually play in the car. When ever I stop I have to reset my phone!👎🏼 went to Jango 🤗 
Very good Christian music I enjoy every bit of it make me fill the presence of the Holy Spirit!
I listen every single day!
The depressing commercials about the diabetes and the prescription that causes death and children cancer in between songs should be banned from kids stations. This is not necessary and brings up questions my 4 year old is not ready to hear the answer to. Thanks!
Super
I keep getting a notification saying this station isn’t working try another one, but all of my stations are doing this. Please fix this bug. When this is done there will be a five star rating. Thank you!
As always, Pandora does it's job.
This is a nice app for listening to music as long as you don't mind adds but if you do not like adds you can just upgrade.
At first, Pandora was great. It showed me all the music I like and from the artists/bands that I wanted. Then, ads galore interrupted my music in between every song. The songs also aren’t even ones I like. I make stations with one artist in mind and never here a song by them. I don’t want to upgrade to Pandora Plus, though, so the app has become extremely irritating for me. I’m switching to Spotify.
👍 me encanta mucho pandora
Na na na, La la la, Da da da
I like Pandora but every time I’m listening to Pandora my phone restarts itself I don’t have any problems with this happening on my other apps just Pandora I wonder why
It The Best
I listen to Pandora on shuffle with a variety of my favorite genres.  I’m inspired to get up and move! I love Pandora and wouldn’t listen to anything else!
The best
Makes my lifestyle easier. Music taste for any occasion.
Luv y’all for real
I love the music!
I love it
great stations
Nf radio station isn't available. Restarted device. Deleted app. Downloaded app. Same msg.
Always on time with the mood!!!
Loooooovvveeee Pandora! I listen to Pandora more than the radio or my satellite radio!
If I skip a song every single time you play it, odds are I don’t want to hear it. Stop playing
Something is wrong with the app, it does not play music.
Me ayuda mucho es buena app
Plays the same songs. Over and over and over and over and over again.
Derramaderos
I used to love the thumbprint radio station... but not anymore. It was another shuffle for me! If I wanted to listen to the dance station I would play it! It just play the same genre until I close it and open it then it’s the rock station or so on... Like hello?! Where the shuffle?! Pandora is going down hill like every other app! Also when I skip a song there’s an add or 2 add that play EVERYTIME I SKIP A SONG! What is that?!?! And then a pop up EVERY TIME!! I’m trying to drive here and be hands free stop with the free premium add! I said no 50 times!! What part of no do u not get pandora?! This app is like a creep trying to rape someone and doesn’t understand no!

Like the playback feature. Not intuitive to find/edit your likes, diversify a station, and some other things.
Send all my old family history pictures and videos and send all my  Bookmark videos to my iPhone app and android app and iPod app and android app and sends all to my photos Albums app and sends all to me thank you all for all your help today and App and I love it and I hope all your help is on my way home app thank you for all your help and l love is a great app to use app for photos and videos to send all pictures
I have had NO problems with this app what so ever and I love t I absolutely love it and I can sometimes pick whatever song I want and that makes the app even better
I had a banner pop up for a free trial in which I attempted to try since it said it was a FREE TRIAL & boom next day I saw that I was charged! Definitely not happy about that, would not have done it if I knew I was going to be charged! Very unsatisfied about this!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry to hear this!

Pandora was my go to music app. When Sonos lost control of pandora and it directs you to pandora web site the app crashes all the time. No other music service does this. They have had multiple app updates and some were good but a new one came out and back to crashing. Maybe consider letting Sonos have control again since it worked when they did...
I used to love Pandora, but these days I can’t get it to start half the time and it doesn’t play well with my new Apple CarPlay, either. (The problem seems to always be Pandora’s.) When it finally starts up, it works great.  I find the occasional commercials much less annoying than the DJs on Sirius/XM.
I love this app! The adds aren't bad at all. The only two things that are the problems is this.  	You can’t listen to a specific song. I think you might be able to in premium, but I’m not sure.  You type in a song, for example ABC’s, (stupid example, I know,) and it comes up with songs just like it, and the ABC’s will never come on! I think that you should fix this. Maybe when u type a song, it could be the first one on, then others like it will come on afterwards. 	 The next thing is is it doesn’t work out of WiFi. I think it works if you keep the window tap open, but I’m not sure I haven’t tested it. YET.....  Anyways, thank you for reading this review. It’s worth getting! 
I love pandora I use it for all my music
Great way to be able to get a vast variety of music.
The world should have a direct link to Pandora’ Music. What joy! What peace!
Just switched from Spotify what you got ?
I have never left a review on any app before but I feel compelled to. I love Pandora for the most part, but the amount of times I’m asked to upgrade to premium is getting out of hand. If I want to upgrade I know that I can and I know where to go to do so. I don’t want to be prompted every single time I open the app (for the first time, to change a song, to switch stations, etc.) to upgrade.
The keep paying attention to what funds good musIcs
Why do I get an ad every time I skip a song? I know u want us to buy premium but I remember when Pandora played more music then ads
I couldn’t ask for a better app. It is much appreciated-very easy to navigate...thanks for everything
Darling dance with me you look perfect tonight
Terrestrial radio can not compare, only playing the same songs 12 times a day gets boring!
Pandora is a great music app if you want to be able to workout,study,party,etc
I bought the Apple Watch partly for convenience. Using the Pandora Apple Watch app is a horrible experience.  Constantly looking at the spinning wheel. I’m about to cancel my subscription and move to Apple Music.
I love the music 🎶 so many people to play on the app
That is the mist stupid question: are you still listening? We pay for songs... REALLY?! you make me listen to commercials and more I listen mire often ads pop up! So quit annoying with those breaks. I am listening and working and painting and designing, I have not time to push that stupid button every time you “hate to play songs for empty room”... just dumb
I used to be able to read my bookmark list and see all the songs I added to that list and now I can’t. It’s not even an option anymore. Yet I still am able to bookmark songs. Please fix this.
Love it 😍
My thumbed-up song lists go blank after scrolling down from the first 5.
The latest updates allowed me to upgrade to a subscription where I can play music directly rather than via stations. However, the app drains the battery and heats up my phone noticeably (iPhone 7). I’ve literally opened the app and watch the battery visibly drop. The drain is so bad that I can’t listen to music without charging my phone at the same time. My wife has the same problem.   The new UI is also confusing because it creates a playlist with the same name as your station that only has all the thumbed up songs on it - separate from the station but mixed in. It also just starts playing immediately, without letting me choose a station or playlist. 
I tried finding my stations in premium and was surprised that I could not sort them alphabetically. So I had to spend a frustratingly inordinate amount of time just to locate my stations. In fact one can only search by most recently added. Who has time to remember when a station is added. While having complete access to playlists, unlimited replays and uninterrupted listening is really exciting, being unable to sort through 60 stations quickly and easily was a deal breaker for me. Finding my music and playing them should not be complicated especially since I’m paying fir it. So I’m back to regular Pandora, which by the way has my music sorted alphabetically!
It’s terrible it won’t even let me listen to music!
Love ❤️ it 👍🏽👍🏽
I love it! It plays my music non stop all day. I can replay a song if I want to listen to it again, have my own playlist that plays with or without internet! Who could be disappointed
This is the best 😁😁😁
They replaced the screen that had artist’s info with Ads. I’m SO sick of Ads in all these apps. I deleted a good app because of stupid Ads. I can’t tolerate the Ads you had before, but this.... this.... this is TOO MUCH! Goodbye Pandora!

Now pandora plays one music they take a commercial break. I get that you guys need to make money but remember not everyone can afford the premium.
This is a great music station but sometimes I like to hear one artist. Also more up to date selection! Thsnks
Okay so I’ve been testing out many music streaming services over the past few months and I’d like to say right off the bat that pandora is in the top two.  So I’ll start off with all the things that I enjoy.   This app is absolutely BEAUTIFUL! It’s very clean and easy to use 2 thumbs up for their design team.  The radio feature is not lacking what so ever. A big problem with these paid music streaming services is that their algorithm and interface for the radio feature is very lacking but not pandora, this is due to pandora starting off as a dedicated internet radio app and building from that foundation and that really sets this app apart from others.  Ok so for the not so nice stuff.  Pandora has many features that I have grown to love however in my time using this application I’ve noticed an essential feature missing and that is the ability to add a song to my queue and this is the reason I’m giving this a 4 star rating   In addition to that, another downfall is that pandora premium is a mobile only application which means I can’t use my paid services on my computer sadly and if it weren’t for how beautiful and easy this app was to use then I would’ve given it 3 stars. 
I get it you’ve got bills to pay but the amount of commercials on Pandora now is ridiculous
Dope sauce!?
SO IN LOVE WITH PANDORA ❤️❤️❤️
I do not appreciate that as I’m trying to listen to Post Malone, Jason Aldean decides to make his appearance and play some country music. Please sort your music a little better next time.
What a pleasure. This music & that music is always available my way! Thanks.
thanks for hear what i say and i ask you to change in the app, now i can listen to my music all day no matter how many add come out i appreciate the change
I listened to pandora religiously at my job for 9+ hour shifts with my beats headphones. After this last update, ads are absolutely awful! There are 3 annoying ads after every song, including one with a screaming baby.. I do not want to hear that in my ear!I will be going to a different competitor for a while that is not money hungry & expects you to pay $14 a month to listen to music without ads. Bye pandora!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

When I listen to pandora on the computer (although it has been a while) or my phone/iPad, I don’t have any problems. I mainly like to listen at home through firestick. Lately it has been very aggravating. When one song ends, it takes forever to play the next song. I usually get an error message before the next song plays, if it plays at all. Sometimes the screen just turns white. Please fix!! I have tried to remove the app and install again. The app is updated.
Need more skips
Omg #amazing😜🤣😜
The past 5+ updates have all said "reduce crashes". Yeah right, nothing's changed. I still have crashes on a regular bases. I use pandora while I workout and of course, every time it crashes, I'm in the middle of the set. Worst thing in the world: you're in your mojo then boom, it's brought to a halt. Fix these dumb crashes for good!
Best app ever, I’ve had for 3 years and I’m so happy I got it
Would be nice if you could create stations with a common theme. Example.. fishing, rodeo, and so on.  Just a thought. Thanks.
The app doesn’t open anymore. This version may have fixed bugs, but now I can’t even open the app even after restarting my phone, deleting, and reinstalling the app :(  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

whenever i listen to music on pandora it plays for awhile then just crashes. i open the app back up and it either skips the song i was listening to completely or starts it all over again. it’s so annoying. please please please fix this asap

I honestly prefer this app to other streaming apps, because I’m used to it and I like making my own channels BUT I can’t even listen to 3 or more songs with out the app freezing my entire phone and shutting down everything.
Pandora premium is worth every penny to not be interrupted with commercials, and to be able to listen to music in ‘offline’ mode. However, I have to delete and reinstall 3-4 times a week because the app will lock up and say ‘buffering, your music will be back shortly’. Nothing else seems to fix this.  Very disappointed in this, otherwise would be 5 stars. 
The only reason it’s 4 stars is that there are points when I’m listening to a song, then my whole phone crashes; I have to re-enter my passcode, then the song that was playing restarts.
For months now pandora crashes in the background within 10 minutes of opening the app. Causes the springboard of my phone to crash and respring every time I use it. Regardless of the amounts of updates, this happens all the time and on various versions of iOS. I’ve even also ran into friends of mine that have the same problem.  Love the app but this is crazy sometimes as i use Pandora when I’m driving 😬
WHY DO MOST MUSIC APPS NOT WORK IN SO MANY COUNTRIES PLEASE FIX THIS
Hey Pandora Team,  I’ll keep this brief, but I was just thinking how annoying it is that I can’t blend a pair of stations without using shuffle. I think that just below shuffle you should have a function that allows listeners to mix and blend a few stations. I’m not sure what limitations you need to put on it legally, but I think if you guys can do it that would be super cool.   Thanks Fam,  LM 
First time doing the subscription and it says for a month but I was only using it for 10 minutes and it said my subscription had already expired.... that’s why I’m giving it a one star!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble!

The best
I’d just like to say that pandora ought to catch up. The Sam’s clubs in our state have all been closed, yet we’re still hearing ads about how great Sam’s is. 😳
I have been using pandora for the past 5 years now. I decided to give their premium a try and liked it for a bit. A good amount of the songs I want to hear are restricted due to licensing and sometimes I can’t even replay my music with out pressing replay multiple times as if they don’t want you to use the feature. Ive waited long enough to have them fix those issues but there still there. Spotify has catched my eye where it’s doing everything I wanted pandora to do with no problems.
Easy to get the app, but I don’t see how to cancel. Premium subscription is Way overrated and too expensive.
love this app
It’s absolutely ridiculous how many commercials you run in this app. Every other song, has another 1-2 commercials. Definitely will not spend any money on an app that ensures it’s listeners testing the service are bombarded with crap so often. You’ve annoyed me out of possibly paying for your service. Well done.
Thanks❤️

Really convenient
I've been using Pandora for a few weeks now...I don't know how or why I didn't create an account sooner! Music makes everything in its path better and having "my pandora music" in the palm of my hand, makes walking my path that much more magical. I never imagined having my own personal "station" was possible, let alone one that constantly introduces sounds that are now essential to my journey. Thanks to the folks at Pandora and my deepest appreciation to all the Artists!
I'm forever hooked!!
Sure I have my favs (Buck & Dwight) but my mood swings like an old saloon door on a Friday night. So this Ol Cowboy doesn’t always feel the “City billy” and he needs to hear some British Invasion or Some Cannonball Aderly, then again we might need the pure Zen of  Classical Indian-Bollywood... point being that my life is better with Pandora giving me whatever it takes to get a little more balance in full force.  Glad to share since you asked. Cheers 
Great stuff.   The more I rate thumbs up or down, the better my music gets.
I’ve been a supporter of the application for a long time, however lately it would crash multiple times.
Title says it all. Great song selection, far better then iHeart👎. However after every 2 songs you have to deal with commercials. Way to many.

Pandora radio? More like addora padio. Honestly they destroyed they’re app with so many advertisements. It used to be so great
Keeps automatically changing my songs I plug in my Bluetooth speaker
Best app on the market.  Been a listener since day 1. 
Pandora premium is well worth it due to being able to create playlists for offline mode, but the music suddenly stops on and off while online. Hopefully it’ll be fixed soon!
App is extremely buggy. It doesn’t play the right songs, it ignores me sometimes when I tell it to click on certain songs. The play button is so small that when I play something from my library I usually end up opening it and having to hit play again. You guys are not good at music and it’s the only thing you do. I switched back to Spotify.
I love pandora. I mean there's not much else to say. I love it!!!
Love Pandora but this app is annoying. Every time I open it tells me about how to listen offline and that I can get concert alerts. Great but telling me this everytime is very annoying and I can’t figure how to turn it off.
Pandora is great...5 Star for Music
Love
I’ve enjoyed Pandora as I’m working around the house or the down time at work.  Could use more variety on all stations and could definitely use more ‘offline’ stations for when folks are traveling.  But I enjoy it
Download Spotify is Better!  Less Annoying Ads 
This app gives me all the songs I want the only problem is no two steps from hell😞 but I can live without it as I'm typing this out I'm currently listening to Pandora music
Why dont you have m.o.v.e. I was watching this anime called “Initial D” and i found eurobeat in Pandora but i cant find the music artists of the intros for the anime.
Lo máximo!!!!!!!
I was thoroughly disappointed with the download feature of the app. It took too long to download playists and I was not able to use the upgrade much outside of coverage.  That said, I predominantly drive while listening so I have limited interaction with the app while listening.  I felt as though both the slowness of download and my own specific usage of the app contributed to an overwhelmingly poor experience for $13? per month. 
Satisfied!!!
To be honest Spotify is a little better on the computer, but on my phone pandora is 100% better. You get ads, just like with any free music app. But only songs in the genre you like will pop up, un like with Spotify occasionally songs from the top 40 will come out of nowhere and you can’t skip them! Also pandora over time understands what music you like and introduces you to awesome stuff. If you want great music, get this app.
It is what it is
If I have to reinstall my app one more time I’m freaking down with this crappy app
I was upgraded to a “free” trial, I’ve spent over a month trying to get Pandora out my account back to normal... guess what.. they “can’t” they blame apple.. Apple says their end shoes no subscriptions etc and blames pandora.. so after bing with pandora for 10 years.. they just burned another customer. Be cautious with this proprietor!
It’s not specific enough. You’re going from disco to R&B and every once in a while I hear print song.
I’ve had this app for 3 years and out of all of that all it does is repeat the same songs you like Over and over and over and if you try to skip them it shuts down the channel and you won’t be able to use it until the next day or later in the same day the only reason this didn’t get 1 star was because I found one single song I didn’t know before that I now like
It has been several months that the app just crashes my whole phone and was hoping it was going to get fixed but apparently you guys aren\'t aware of it. Every single time I use the app for longer than like 30 minutes, it crashes. Please fix this, it\'s annoying. I really don\'t have any other information than that. It\'s on any station. Longer than 30 minutes l. iPhone 6s.

Me encanta Pandora, me gustaría q se pudiera repetir una canción
Awesome music app
Happy to be a part
I love Pandora! Pandora is my only APP I use for MUSIC. 
Probably try to update to more trending songs...example when I’m listening to Rihanna’s channel I want to hear stuff from her old and RECNT albums .. most of the stuff they play is all the back from 2010. Stay to up to date other than that great shuffle app🙌🏾
Love it!!
Good good very good!!!!❤️❤️❤️
I have an iPhone and had my thumb resting on the home button when the pop-up appeared and suddenly I’m the owner of a Premium account. This broke college kid can’t afford that! Is there a way to cancel the payment?
I had no problems with advertisements. They were not often or long.  Song selection was pretty great after very little time.  Now, however, the app stops after about 5-10 songs and asks if your still listening. Work comes to a stop so I can go over to my iPad and start the next song going. Very irritating.  Pandora plus might stop that. Don’t know. Is it worth $5/month?  Probably. One more thing to nickel and dime my paycheck. 
I am new to this and I am a Christian child of God and I love Gosple songs anywhere anytime thank you
Love it 😍😘😜🤩
I let my son have the app on his phone and disabled explicit content and somehow his songs were still full of cuss words. Please fix this issue!
Bad
Luv pandora❤️
Love pandora! Simple is that! Perfect!!! 
I love pandora but in the free version a lot ads 😥😥😥
I’m so impressed in how they keep bringing me new favorite songs by just aligning them with my likes. 🤩❣️
Loved it better then other apps
Love it. Better with ever time I check in.
Could be more user friendly, separate stations from artist and songs better
It’s always great listening to Pandora. It plays songs I love and introduces me to new artists that I didn’t know I loved!
Good
All of the music that you like… and songs you didn’t even know that you liked, until now!
I don’t like the new update I can’t talk or comment to friends anymore rather with the old version I could
Too many ads.
To many ads and need more skips.
So at first it was good but now after I watch an add for more skips it will skip the first song mostly because I was tired of hearing it then it would go to a song I would instantly thumps down but it doesn’t skip so what’s the point in watching the adds otherwise.
Love Pandora! Helps me go the extra mile at the gym all the time
i love it is my favorite and they can do everything
This app is MUCH better than Spotify in many ways, but has less music that I like. Most of the music I listen to is music from anime like from Uta no Prince Sama or Kuroshitsuji. On Spotify, I was able to find music from Uta no Prince Sama but was impossible to play without premium which you have to pay for. Pandora however is easy and is free. At least it has music from Fairy Tail and Attack on Titan. I'm pretty satisfied and the ads aren't thrown in that often. Every few songs it'll throw in an ad, but it's understandable as I don't really have enough for premium. If it had more selection, I would give 5 full stars, but I'm already quite satisfied. Another thing to add is that I'm happy I can leave the app and have it still playing in the background (like right now) with my favorite songs. Great job 👍👍 
Great variety always finding something new and all the old music I love however I have only one problem with pandora its virtualy impossible to get the help you need or even contact an actual person to help you

When ever I try to upload it says I need to update it and I try and then it crashes I have a iPhone 5 and it never works.😡😡
I only listen to pandora..one thing tho after a while the same songs will play over and over..
I enjoy the app, ads aren't too often and music selection, while not perfect, is pretty good.   However every time I listen for about 30 minutes it crashes once, and then is stable. The same thing always happens, there is a visual error and the music cuts out, my phone has the buffering symbol as if the phone shut down, my phone restarts, I go back into the app and it restarts whatever song I was on. There is no rhyme or reason why it happens, sometimes I'll be in an app, sometimes I'll be browsing Safari, sometimes I'll be doing nothing and it happens. This glitch has persisted for several months now. The app is still usable, but it's a nuisance I'd like to see resolved. 
I have had this app for a long time now, I decided to try the premium... the trial was great and after the trial was over and I started getting charged was when the problem started. I have been charged for this app for 3 months now and after the trial ended I could not get this app to work,every time I turned it on all it said was “buffering” and never played any music at all! Very disappointed. Also the only reason I kept the app for 3 months was because I could not figure out how to cancel it on my phone which is the only place I use this app.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Well im a Spanish listener and the mix is not so good but its chip so wont complain dat much
Get this app it is Great
Best app but finally deleted it and stopped using because d the Duracell crying baby ad. I wish Pandora was more selective about the ads. Some ads really ruin the mood.
I finally cancelled my subscription. Offline content wasn’t playing like it should. The app would suddenly just stop playing streaming music at least a couple times a day. I first thought it was my connection or my headphones so I tried using other music streaming apps and the music played flawlessly. Fix your app.
I want to listen to just Hamilton and I have to deal with other songs and it is very annoying
Too many commercials
I have been using this app for many years. But recent upgrades makes a lot pop up whenever you pay attention to this app. And it makes it very easy to click upgrade to premium. Not cool. 
Good mix of music
It wasn't really too good but I could at least listen to some music as I got Spotify.
Free music. A few commercials. Like/dislike feature works well. (Tip: You get less commercials if you aren't looking at your screen)
Only used iTunes and YouTube this app is way better.

It's great for when you want to listen to music
What’s better than on demand tunes?
This is amazing! Better than IHeartRadio and Spotify! Easy and fun to use! Thank you for being the best in Free radio!! Tim Zetterwall  Seattle 
Every time I use this app it crashes on  me or if  I hit the skip button it flips through a lot a songs and crashes. Why am I using the pandora premium crap that isn’t even worth it. I am no longer supporting pandora radio. I even tried updating the app and even my phone but it still does it. It is not my phone or my network nor the WiFi connection. do NOT use this app! 
Es buena
I love it sooo much !
Too many ads not enough variety on the stations.
I don’t know what these designers are thinking. Creating and maintaining a list is so freaking hard. I can access the list in 3 different views and in each view actions are limited. 2018 and pandora can’t even figure out a playlist.
I have been a "One" member for years. I have the other apps but my Pandora stations are aways what I want to listen to-familiar and always something new.
Pandora is probably the best music radio I've ever had Though I am not able to get Pandora Premium, the app itself is very good It's like it knows what I want to listen to at the time Pandora is a really good app 
Was a pandora plus member 3 days, always had to restart the app, didn’t get my unlimited skips/reply’s that they said they would give. Apple/Spotify I recommend strongly.

Premium is advertised for $9.99 and and year for $109 on the internet. You can get 2 months premium for free the ad says. I am a long time user of Pandora and was considering paying the yearly price for a their premium service. I tried to go to the website on my IPad and it keep taking me to the Pandora app. The app wants $12.99 per month for Pandora premium with no yearly discount. What’s up with that??? Hell no! I am not going to play that game. I will not upgrade and will like go to Spotify or Apple Music.

I absolutely LOVE pandora to listen to music!! Apart from the adds everything is amazing and the quality is LIT!!! Thank GOD it’s free!!!
I love Pandora, but these crashes are unbearable. I use the IPhone 7, and I don’t see why these crashes randomly started a couple months ago and haven’t been fixed.
I totally understand the need for ads.  Though I'd prefer not to have them, for a free service, that I love, it's more than tolerable. What irritates me, is the request to rate and review, which seemingly pops up every few minutes.
Kane Brown all of You’re songs are good they are perfect just especially thunder and the rain and way back in third grade
Download right now this is so amazing
Love the app, but lately I find the selections going way off in left field, even with 4-5 thumbs down on an artist in one sitting.  Feel like the algorithm is testing my patience to push me toward a subscription.
Being able to skip songs however many times you want is great and also find out songs you like from suggestions and creating Playlist are easy. It's great if you always have to make long distance drives.
Premium is great. Wish it didn’t drain my phone battery and I could use it on my tablet
Signed up for the “free 30-day trial” and then was charged for premium after the 30 days was up without notice. 1/5 much disappoint, miss old pandora
I just got a four month free subscription to Premium, so I have been on this app all the time! I love their smart thumbprint technology; I have it where radio plays the songs I like and others that I learn to enjoy! Although, a lot of the songs I want to listen to are not available for immediate play, and I have to listen through on radio to play the songs I want. Not very efficient when I want to listen to a song immediately. I know that it’s not possible to get the rights to all songs, but that’s me. Also, I noticed when I open up one of my stations and try to scroll through my previously played songs on that station, the screen goes white. It doesn’t crash, but I can’t look at anything. Just a small bug that needs to be fixed. So far, good experience.
Great app for people that don’t want to pay $ to listen to music
I have the Premium version and it honestly needs lots of fixes. When It is playing music on my playlist on shuffle, it randomly goes to songs not even on my playlists. Also, when I want to listen to my downloaded playlists offline, most of the time it is buffering, and takes a long time to load it which makes no sense since they’re downloaded.
I’ve been listening for pandora for a while now but recently about 2 months now I like to play logic and I skip songs not by him and it’s frustrating because sometimes when I play his station and I never get one song by him but when I play another station his music is there. Usually when I go to logics radio rappers and music I’ve never heard of is there not only that but sometimes there isn’t even rap can you please fix this issue please and thank you
I just used the Pandora app for the very first time today... I’ve actually had the app installed on both my iPad Pro and iPhone 6 for some time, but never got around to using it until now. I am a big (huge) music fan... I *was* looking for an app for my devices that would allow me to listen to music by some of my fav artists on ‘channels’ (i.e. Pink Floyd material on one channel, Marshall Tucker on another channel, Steven Wilson on another, etc). And I wanted to listen to this music without ads if possible (even if I have to pay some sort of one-time or periodic fee, etc)... otherwise I could certainly live with limited ads.  Well, boys and girls... Pandora is clearly not this kind of app. Actually, this app and my first-time experience with Pandora sucked... and I have already deleted the app from both of my devices. First, I found out that the ‘genre’ channels they have available are littered with ads... there are silent pop-up ads on the screen for each song you listen to, and there are add’l ads beyond that with audio that get inserted in your listening experience often (far too often). Yuk. In addition, there are a limited number of times you can use the skip button to skip past songs you don’t like, or songs that don’t really belong in the genre (and I found out there are plenty of those)... you then have to watch more ads to continue to skip. Really? Is this an app centered around the music, or centered around advertising (like so many other apps are)?  I was expecting so much more from my first-time Pandora experience... instead it was a complete disappointment and a total waste of time. I can’t recommend this app to anyone... unless you like ads and ad-based restrictions in the app more than music. 
Great music variety!
They added more ads
I like it because it’s just really cool. If I search up a song, it will show up.!
I depend on Pandora to get me through every car ride, and it’s awesome! But for some reason the app crashes on me 3-4 days out of the week. I have the latest version, so I’m not sure why it crashes, but a fix would be awesome! Thank you 🙂
I made the dire mistake of updating my pandora tv app and now it constantly messes up. Keeps asking me if I want to keep listening every few songs or sometimes after 1 song over and over again. Settings changed and I can’t figure out how to stop the app without logging out everytime. HATE IT. So frustrating now  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

It used to be good but now it feels like every other song has a commercial in between. Also, if i forward a song, it automatically kicks in a commercial. I understand the need for those, but, the frequency is ridiculous. Today is the last day i use this app... im deleting it and going with another music app... even willing to pay another outfit because i feel that pandora is hijacking and holding hostage my music experience and i wont be a part of that. Too bad because it started pretty good but it has gotten progressively worse.
Wish there was a wider variety of Spanish music... 😔
if you don't subscribe, you'll get a stupid advertisement between almost every single song... it's ridiculous! And it completely shuts off every other song. Plus iHeart music is also free and plays NO commercials.
Great App.
I’ve had Pandora Premium for a few months now. It was great for my pool days with all the playlists I could make with downloaded songs for offline listening. However, here recently it has been freezing up and some of my downloaded songs are no longer downloaded. When I tried to download the songs (that I already had) it just shows it’s still downloading. It’s extremely frustrating when you are trying to drive and listen to music when it won’t work correctly. Super disappointed lately!
It is the best thing for music
I have had pandora since late in 2009 or early 2010. Pandora is not what it used to be, historically i have given pandora 3-4stars, there are many many nice new features and improvements however the new pandora is pretty bad. I impatiently await the next update. i loved your service and would have had loved to pay for a premium membership but your no longer providing the quality i expect from you. For starters your music algorithm has only gone down hill with your most recent updates. By this i mean the way pandora delivers music is different and i no longer have a single station that plays what i want to hear and no stations capable of playing my diverse interests. These days im using all my skips and heading over to youtube or my itunes library because im not happy with whats playing. I want you to improve your music algorithm by: changing the selection so music is less fed by artist or album more emphasis on each individual song theme or sound; just cuz i liked one song by queen does not mean i want the next six songs that are not even related to the sound style of the station to be by queen. If i put multiple genres into one playlist i do not want to hear 4 of the same genre in a row; if i did i would have made the station that singular genre.  Second it is upsetting to be given an option to watch a video to gain more skips then watch a 14second inaudable video that only allows 1skip before locking me in. The add time, the add itself, and the reward are all inappropriate here. Please do not misunderstand there was no problem in the audio feed, the add itself had a speaker that mumble squeeked rather than speaking. I do not ever appreciate this; have a standard for the adds that are played: if your add is a man talking, into a headset while sitting in a sound booth of all things, i aught to be able to understand him...honestly i must tell you i do find this disrespectful, you think my time is worth so little you have the gall to play this trash and not even pay me for wasting my time? i pay you by watching your adds right now, no? And my time watching that trash is worth one song i dont get to listen to? I will never opt for such an option from you again. My time is worth a lot more. it only furthers your reprehensible position that the allotted skips where only used because you couldnt play a song related to my seeds to begin with. Also you need to declutter the ui. 
I love this radio, I can choose what kind of music I want to listen. I always listen every night to put the baby to sleep.
Pandora is the best thing to listen to music with. But the bad thing is that it plays stuff on other stations such as Mexican music on a kids bop station.
Love music specially old school
I was listening to pandora on Sonos.  With much thought I left the house, jumped in my car, and started pandora up.  I received alerts in the app and nasty emails because I “violated terms of use”.  Pandora wants me to pay for more accounts.    Cancelled!  Do like Spotify.  If I listen to on multiple devices stop playing on all but the latest with activity. 
I love this app you can listen T.I annie loblonk. She also on betrayal she is like my beast kid singer bony get me right so is Joni siwa but Annie is a good singer to I love her 😍😘😍😘😍😘😍😘❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💕💘💙💖💝💜💜💜💝💙💙💖💙💖
Don't like the commercial apps! Please take it out for me !

I listened to Pandora since 2006. Love it! Just got a lot of repetitive songs, but good enough for being free!!
An overall great way to experience music, but since I don’t have premium, the app almost forces me to get premium. This is because I can’t replay certain songs I like (since they are greyed out) and it feels like the app is almost forcing me to get premium. I would if I had an extra $12 or so to get it.
Please bring support to Apple Watch over LTE.
The new version of the app is less user friendly and not fun to use. What happened to alphabetized listings?
You guys have some good music and besides I know a lot of your music and I like and love it
Hey thanks for making it so easy to cancel something I accidentally subscribed for! Just kidding I’ll delete my whole account and app instead. Congrats on your marketing schemes Apple Music and Spinrilla is better anyway ☺️👋
It's awesome wide variety of mixes
I LOVE thumbprint radio // thank you!!!!
This was one of the worst apps I’ve ever seen. And it has way to many ads on it. And the app crashed every time I opened it when I tried to delete it, it caused my iPhone to immediately stop working. Now I am here👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
I understand pandora the free version to put adds and to buy the premium for no adds I get that! That’s marketing. But, when it comes to like every two songs and there’s like a minute of adds? That’s not the pandora I used to know four years ago when I started using you guys.... your losing subscribers doing that.
Pandora doesn’t let you listen to a lot of songs because of their music license

So I have pandora premium now and I really like it, the main problem is I can’t scroll through my likes and when I do it blanks out and stays like that. Please fix this. Other than this I really like pandora
Pandora is getting way to many ads it’s not even funny, bring back the pandora with few ads stop trying to be like Spotify
I love listening to comedy when I can’t sleep at 3 in the morning. I love listening to different genres or decades of music during the day.
Lately everytime I try to switch the app I’m on, or get a notification, even if it’s on do not disturb, the music stops, and it makes me upset. I’m actually considering spotify🤮
I am trying to listen to a good song but it keeps on going to the same screen and crashing :(
I want to know how many times I have to press the 👎🏽 dislike button when "Despacito" by Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee ft. Beaver plays until it actually stops playing. Every time it plays I 👎🏽 and it still freaking Plays. I have no problem with the real version I like it every time it plays but please make the beaver version stop PLEASE!!!!
Al songs are fit to everybody..🤙
Music is life. Thank you.
It's better than Spotify, which don't get me wrong is awesome, but the thing that pandora does better is it helps introduce people to new music much better than Spotify.
I've found so many great songs that I love on here and I've never even gotten premium!
This is a great app that provides every song in the world and is very good. I love it👍🏻
Used to be better before they played commercials all the time, then you can’t even watch commercials for more skips, you just have to watch commercials.
Ads are the same every time during startup, and freezing in iOS 11.2.2
I mean it’s okay
Don't get me wrong Pandora is great. I love how e if you run out of skips you can always get more. But like all the good stuff is like premium. In my opinion Spotify is better
I like Pandora but when the ads come on for skips that’s fine BUT every month or a while it’s 1 ad so i want it different instead of some car ad for 2 weeks then Ibotta for don’t know how long??? Plz have multiple ads for a small time instead of the SAME ad for a month when you wanna skip
Pandora knows me well lol
AWESOME!
Better than the greedy Spotify
“Sounds of the resistance” Really?
I might unsubscribe and switch back to Spotify because I pay for Pandora Premium which means I should be able to download stations and songs and then listen offline. But after downloading my stations and attempting to listen offline it just glitches and says it’s buffering, from which at that point I have to go online, download the station again, switch to offline, and then play my songs...and then it only works for a couple of hours. I’ve tried resetting my downloads and even signing out, it’s ridiculous to pay for something that doesn’t work....  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing!

Far to many ads. This morning I have gotten one or two ads after every song. All in a push to make everyone pay. Well I will be paying just not for your service because of this. I will be making a switch to Apple Music
But lately pandora has been utter garbage. Crashes constantly, screws up the synch with my Bluetooth devices oh and the latest issue where all my radio stations eventually trend into the same 2 stations. Why the hell does my Garth Brooks station play the same music as my Led Zeppelin station? Those two aren’t even remotely close Pandora!!  Hire new programmers. Until you do I’m going to Spotify.

Pandora is great. But it’s far from perfect. If there is one thing I could wish for it would be an EQ. Some of us just need to make some adjustments with bass, mid, and treble. There should also be presets that you can apply in real-time. Don’t let Spotify beat you to it!!

So nice songs
I get the popups but the commercials are overkill. Simply put Pandora should offer tangible upgrades for purchasing their product. Essentially their marketing strategy is to harass their listener into purchasing their product.
for me it’s not too many options
Love it!
Thanks for get lyrics back!! 😍😍😍
If I want to listen to swing, I should be able to create a swing station by only typing “swing”. Sometimes I don’t want to discriminate in a vast field possibilities.

It pretty good but it’s better the Pandora plus 🤷‍♂️
I love pandora but the todays hits station does not play “today’s “ hits. It play all hits even from 30+ years ago. Really annoying
It is amazing one of the most amazing music source 😁😊
Ive seen such an improvement in pandora since when I first started subscribing. Best internet radio out there.
For the love of God please stop asking me to upgrade to premium. I'm already paying you for plus, please **** off.
I understand that money is made through advertisements, but there is a difference between making money, and rolling in it. There are too many adds, if there was 1 add for every 5 songs it would be great. I also understand that they feel like they have to push people towards getting premium, and they are doing a great job about it
It skips all over the songs played! Or even doesn’t finish the song. It’ll get close to the end and completely skips to the next song. I just want to have an enjoyable listening experience.

Sound cloud doesn’t have all these adds and it has radio station for free and everything
Great
Greatest music
The glory days: music that brings back you to memory lane !
With Apple’s planned obsolescence for iPhones, this app is slower than a Cupertino traffic jam. Terrible. 1 star is too generous.
Great selection!
Hi, I love this app! I love to play my favorite artists! But sometimes it plays songs not from that artist., when I skip them, I usually run out of skips. I really don’t like when it does that so maybe their could be something to do about that.
Great App to listen to various of different songs. Free with a few adds but all worth it as it provides music for your ears.
I was tricked into the “free trial of Pandora Premium” while attempting to create a station. I do NOT appreciate being duped. I do NOT want Premium and I do NOT like the way the app looks and there is NO WAY to revert back to Pandora Plus-worse, I am on autopay so I will likely be automatically “upgraded” to a $12.99 monthly bill that I will have to fight. I couldn’t be more dissatisfied or angry. I don’t eat $h1t regardless of how ANYONE serves it. I will likely cancel ALL Pandora services and never go back. Ever.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble!

Once you find your station then Pandora is great! And take a while but I like how Pandora tracks what you like and do not like and makes suggestions for you. Don’t be afraid to try those suggestions our. They may end up being your go to station!
Keep up the excellent work and service.
Love it
This is a good app
Too many ads if not paying full version.
Love pandora
Love that I can listen to my music anytime, anywhere and feel the inspiration of my past.

Please bring back the option to edit which stations you want to shuffle!!  I recently upgraded my account and lost this feature.  Im heartbroken.
Love the selections and different music varieties I can play
Musica
Reduced access to A to Z sorting and too heavy sorting through recent play makes use unwieldy. Sometimes simple is better.
With my thumbs up whenever I listen to Pandora it plays all the songs to soothe my emotions thanks pandora. Most times I have to force myself to turn it off or I won’t get to bed at all
Great
Great app. Adds are repetitive but that’s the price to pay for free streaming music.
I found out by ACCIDENT that Pandora works through my IPhone in my car.  FANTASTIC   NIW I DON’T HAVE TO RENEW MY Sirius Radio Contract!  Thanks Pandora 👍 
Sometimes when driving it’s annoying to get to controls . I’m sure this is kind of the point but if y’all could make the button (or both buttons!) bigger that would be awesome  Thanks 
Love it 😘😘

So many ads. There's an ad between every single song now. I mean, you'll get some music you want to hear, but after 5 songs you hate it because of the ADS. SO MANY ADS.

I love pandora because I can play it anywhere and everywhere. I can also play any song.
Keep putting all the corridos for me. Makes me grab a bottle for good crimes, I mean times! 
I will be listening too music and I will skip a song or change the station and it will freeze up on me and then send me back too home screen its very aggravating and hard too listen too music when it does this, and I cannot even listen too music because only like half of my stations work I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled many times and it still does this.
Good attentiveness to the likes and matching other songs.
Only music can take you back to that special time and the countless memories!! Thank you 
It gives you all tipes  of music
This app is the best thing ever! I am a girl in marching band ( if you don’t know what that is, search it up) and I basically have to listen to music while sleeping (It’s a weird habit) and Pandora has a sleep timer which comes in REALLY handy! I am currently about to go to sleep and listen to my stations on Pandora with a 40 minute timer 😍😍
I love the pandora app and all the music that is available but I can’t play any of my downloaded music! I want to be able to access my downloaded music easily. Other than that the app is great!
Amazing free music
Free
Can you create a playlist on here
💜💙💚💛❤️
Always seems to know what I’m in the mood for.
Amount of ads is getting insane
Awesome
It lets you pick any music or genre that you like to listen to. It also gives you the choice of disliking it or liking it so if you press the thumbs up it will know that you like that type of music.
Pandora is good you can pick any of the songs that you want but Spotify is better because there are no ads and it’s got more option for you like oldies music like Spice Girls
Get some new material..
Is it even possible to have sex without it?
Es una emisora bien buena me gusta
Never disappointed by channel selections.
En música es lo mejor tengo una pizzería y es lo único que tocamos (Pandora )!!!!
Music is good
I love it unlike Spotify u can go without connection without paying!
I’m having a constant problem, and it’s not based on connection. No matter where I am, what connection type I use, the songs “skip” like a scratched disc; completely stop in the middle of a song to go to 3 commercials in a row; or just WILL NOT LOAD! Why? Why?

You guys need help
Pandora can really work if you know what you listen to. I struggled at first to find a good station but eventually I put three artists together in one playlist. Since then all I use is pandora, song after song geared directly towards what I want to hear. I definitely would recommend this Music app, one of the best other than Spotify(Still my fave)
Love pandora, it’s the best app for businesses music choices. Clients of mine enjoys all the songs pandora plays. I like the fact that it can mute the vulgar words as well
Love it! Gets me through my work day
Pandora is my go to source for filling my life and day with music.
You can listen to what ever you want and anywhere it is the bomb!!!!!!!!!

Love the audio quality and song volume being normalized across tracks. However, the gapless playback for live and seamless albums is nonexistent, and I would like to see that addressed.  *1/29/18- Additionally, I’d like to see Pandora Premium integrate an equalizer and the ability to crossfade songs. 
It’s been fine for the past 2 years and now with iOS 11 it keeps stopping songs when I get texts and often times randomly. Then I have to click play again. It’s quite annoying. But other than that it’s been great.
I live he fact that I’m able to listen to old and new music
Me encanta Pandora lo único los comerciales  Deberían de quitarlos o bajar un poco la tarifa Dios los bendiga y tengan una linda semana 
Always find what I want to hear. Love it.
Please remove the wireless accessory mode which locks down the app when connected to car Bluetooth . How is this acceptable? Also improve bitrate for phone and streaming devices. 128k? 192? Is this 2005? Apple Music Spotify is 256k+ sounds much better
I have listened to Pandora for years and have almost always been happy. Highly recommend it.
While the interface is more friendly. It is harder to get out of the app you can no longer quit. You have to log out and log in every time I find it irritating.
I enjoy the diversity of music.
THIS APP ROCKS!! I use it so often and i am very satisfied
The new layout and UI is awesome. It is now as it should have been long ago.  What worries me is that someone will come along and want to change it. Please don’t.  You finally got it right. Thank you!
Mit einer VPN Verbindung echt ein Genuss
Pandora is a great way to discover songs from artists you already know!  A recent update made the app layout on iPad the same as on iPhone and I would prefer for it to have the old layout where all the stations and the song playing are visible without needing to click back to the list of stations after picking a station to listen to. It’s a small detail but would improve overall listening/song selection experience. Thank you. 
Buena 👍
Awesome app! Free music. Only downfall it has too many ads
Either it’s the app or my phone but I can’t view the songs I liked before and it’s starting to make me mad😡
Búscate otro Pedrito,
The layout of the stations was all out of whack for a few minutes, And I got confused.
Stop asking me a question every time I look at the app! Stop giving me basic tips to use basic features EVERY TIME I USE THE APP! I’ve been a subscriber for 15 years! Stop stupid-proofing apps!
Stunning capabilities with selections. What ever mood Pandora is there
Over the years I’ve tried many music station/programs I keep coming back to this one.  Why do I waste my time? Crazy I guess! Thanks Pandora
You cannot go wrong with Pandora, ever!
This is the app I use everyday. And it’s awesome! Always has the music I want to listen to.
Set my favorite station and forget it. No matter if I’m working in the yard, grilling or spending time with my family I can count on good music.
I just love the song
Only because of monthly fee. Should have just a purchase fee in my opinion. With less commercials a purchase fee. With monthly fee no commercials. Just saying... ;)
I mostly listen to radio and Pandora excels at playing music that matches my taste, much better than Apple Music or Spotify.  The only thing preventing me from buying Premium is the sound quality, I believe the kbps maxes at 192 and Apple Music and Spotify just sound better.
This is Charlotte Grace and I love Melanie Martinez. I made a station for her but I haven't heard her songs in 2 days!! All I heard was a bunch of people who don't have any relation to Melanie Martinez. Please make sure that pandora plays more of what we like and none of what we don't like. Thanks, pandora and pandora manager!!💖
The couple stations I listen to the same songs end up playing.
Can’t get enough of my pandora, it keeps the vibe going strong.
Easy Way 2 Listen 2 Errthing Banging 💯💯💯💯💯💯
That’s what happens every couple of hours. Then it turns off the music and I have to check “I’m listening” for the music to resume. Very annoying! If this continues goodbye to Pandora.
I enjoy pandora but don’t think unlimited skips is worth the extra $$ monthly charge.
Pandora cracking the music algorithm is the audio equivalent of the Human Genome Project. This was the holy grail of music everyone dreamed of. Often imitated, never duplicated.

They tell you to buy the premium service to avoid advertisement. Yet, what they don’t tell you is that you still do have advertising, but is done by the artist who sings the songs or music. They let them advertise to you and asking you to buy their records and their music. I don’t care how you look at it, that is still advertisement.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

... when the app is pulled back into the foreground.  The results also drops the song being streamed to a Chromecast. Now, if I don’t recognize a piece and have to pull Pandora into the foreground, app disconnects and I don’t get to listen to the rest of the piece. Problem appeared with latest update; very disappointing for a long-time Pandora user. Otherwise, a wonderful app. 1/28/18 update (post-Pandora reply below): Problem fixed(!) on both iPhone & iPad by latest Pandora update to v1801.2.

...can no longer stream music to devices via chromecast audio
It was better when it didn’t have an ad every 3rd song and more skips😡😡
I pay $5/month to be able to play  music UNINTERRUPTED because when I play music on a loud speaker there’s nothing more annoying than a pause to hear ads/ suggestions. This wasn’t happening before the update, not sure why it’s happening now. So deceptive.
I love Pandora. It has any type of music for any age. I have gotten many friends and family tuned in also. I love it!
Love it when I'm able to travel. My favorite song❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

UPDATE: as of 1/28/18 this app works great just like before on the iphone x 👍, no more crashes and bugs !! so far so good.   This app used to be good. Now it crashes while playing music. Makes my brand new iphone x respring when using this app...

Pandora makes it so hard to unsubscribe on a mobile device but pandora premium isint available on a laptop only on mobile😂 so many tricks!
This is a showstopper for me.  If this feature is not restored in the next 30 days,  I will discontinue my subscription and delete the app from all my devices.  I’ve been a subscription customer for many years.
I already pay to use this app so that I DON’T have to deal with ads. Now I have constant ads asking me to upgrade to the premium service. I am paying to have no ads!!! Stop harassing me to upgrade. Considering canceling my subscription all together, which I’ve had for YEARS. Very lame. And the “premium service” is not much better if at all.
I use Pandora for personal listening, but I’m also an Uber driver and my passengers like the various channels. I also stopped and made a channel for someone on our trip and they loved it!   Thanks Pandora! 
I love the Neil Young station!!! Beyond awesome ❤️😊

Pandora is my life
Many of the songs are his.   The others in same genre.   Good to listen to while working around the house and yard
Accessible & lots of choices
I enjoy listening to the variety of stations on Pandora, easy to use and awesome.
Could use less ads but I like it
Find an alternative. Bluetooth connectivity is horrible! Skips all the time. Even after their latest update. Worked great with my old iPhone 6, but ever since I upgraded to iPhone X, Pandora simply doesn’t work with it and the connection with my car’s Bluetooth.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I love pandora, the only complaint that I have is that there are ads in between songs. But hey, I know that is just for Marketing purposes. Overall, great app!
It is so good and it is free.I listen all day
This app has potential! My family recommend this app to me; my love for one specific type of music, poured into one station!🤯
The Music that is in Pandora is very Awesome to have all the songs wanted from growing up until now. The Variety’s are from Classical Music to all other Music till Now. Pandora is way better then due to hardly any commercials. Pandora is Unique and Original!
crashes constantly:p just get spotify
It's bull bc I went to unsubscribe from premium it said go to App Store to manage ur subscribing ok I'm it said it cancelled but still took 10.00 dollars from me it's b$

This app will not let me cancel my subscription
Needs a new update for iOS Pandora cannot be played on Apple Watch Series 3 watches, the sound will not come out of headsets when is connected to Watch the only works when headphones are connected with cell phone...
Great music, not a lot of ads and plenty of music to choice from
Best thing since bread!!!!
I really enjoy this app because It helps me choose which type of mood I’m in and it’s very reliable when it comes to House party’s I don’t have to for a Dj anymore I just click whatever station and boom there it is .~Emanuel o
Pandora is the best entertainment on the www!
Pandora has been messing up quite a bit on my iPhone 6s. The song starts skipping like an old CD player from the 90's and it starts sounds like Alvin and the Chipmunks. I pay for premium every month and I can't even listen to it half the time because it still does it even after I re start my phone. Please fix this!
I think if I thumbs down a song it should automatically change the song because some songs are really not that great, but at the same time I don’t want to have to change my favorite station man. Please think about this. If people thumbs down a song just to skip to the next song and then thumbs it up again because they like but just don’t feel like listening to it right now then that song should play again. This is one way to get started on the path to trying this out Pandora. Thank you for listening.
Yes
My go to for music to match my many moods. Classical, hard rock, r&b, the oldies, they have it, and I love styling each station to my tastes.
I have used pandora forever but I really dislike their mobile app.  I have to go to my desk top to change my shuffle options and it drives me crazy.  I am starting to use other music options.  I pay for their services too.  Silly me.
Pandora reads my mind
The app doesn’t even work anymore it just keeps saying stations are not available and that’s bull crap because it was literally just working. You guys need to get yourselves together because this is ridiculous. Absolutely one star and if I could give zero stars i absolutely would. Clearly you guys do not give a crap about customer service because there is no way to contact you and no way to fix the problem. I’ve deleted the app and everything and yet it still will not work and this is ridiculous 😡😡 Nvm you guys don’t need to fix it because I’m switching to Iheart radio. Yet again you lose another customer. Great going you guys and no I will not contact someone through that stupid url because I don’t have time for that mess. Good day. 
Too many adds on free version, but don’t want to upgrade and pay to listen to music.
I used to be premium but lately I unsubscribed because this glitches when I pause music it still plays and when I lock my phone I can’t access it on my lock screen.  Very frustrating thinking it was my iPhone, my phone is fully up to date and full signal and all that. And even on WiFi it does such.   I hate also when I open the app and start my free hour. After the add is done it frozen and so if I don’t want to waste my free hour I have to close the app down and open it back up and a little of my free ad free hour is gone. 
I love the music they play
Music for every mood and every occasion
I absolutely love pandora. Great music always changing and keeping t fresh and easy to use ! I gave  it a 5 star rating ... love it 🤗
Pandora is so awesome I love the music
Too many commercials and they are twice as loud as my music which requires running to my phone to turn volume down
Pandora is a app where you could play music replay sing along and it also you create your station I’ve been listening to pandora since I got my iPad and if there is a ad it does not bother me however you can not skip a all the time like say I turn on a song and I don’t like it I skip a lot but then it says you skipped a lot or something like that but still I enjoy listening to pandora and I hope some people will like it to
I love Pandora! BUT these ads kill it for me
Pandora is by far the best outlet out there to enjoy your favorite music as well as experiencing new music. Love it!
Too many commercials it’s like they want to force you to purchase the app..sometimes I get like three commercials back to back
Way to many ads!
Make it to where we can listen to a specific song without pandora plus.
Love it
I’ve had Pandora for years. Even paid for pandora one. Then they made a tier higher than that. Thanks. Here’s an idea Pandora, how about not making me use 15 skips to get a song by the artist the station is made for? And if I skip a death metal song on my contemporary station, it doesn’t mean I’m looking for southern gospel song, or ANOTHER song by the SAME death metal artist I just skipped. This app isn’t worth the $5 a month I spend on it. My time on Pandora is used skipping songs I don’t like rather than enjoying ones I do.
Love Pandora! I listen to it on my tv, computer and iPhone almost daily.
luv this guy 🤟🏽
I will be listening to pandora and then close the app and it will randomly start playing on its own. Doesn’t matter if I’m in my car or not or if anything is plugged in or not, it just randomly keeps playing and it’s the most frustrating thing. Then I double click my home button to see what apps are open and the pandora app isn’t even present but it still plays. I’ve restarted and updated my phone and it’s a newer iPhone not even 1 year old and I have this problem with pandora. So annoying.
I love love love Pandora😻😻😻
The best, thank you.
If you like 30 seconds ads after ONE song then I guess pandora is for you I remember when this app wasn’t bad with advertisements but now it just runs this whole app. Better off just listening on YouTube
Cool app
I love using Pandora! I hardly ever listen to my own stored music anymore because I kept hearing the same song over and over. With pandora that doesn’t happen. Plus I love the fact that I can switch genres whenever I want. There is much to choose from. The $4.99/mo. for commercial-free music is an excellent deal!!
Whatever my mood, there is the perfect music! After returning from France, I couldn’t believe they had Parisian music for me! Love the app!
My favorite station is Today’s Hip Hop and Pop Hits. When it actually plays today’s music, it’s great! For the past week, it has play music in Spanish and like early 2000’s music. I don’t know Spanish and I have a separate station for the 2000’s. Please. I just want the top hits.
I love this app but i hate the ads that’s get in my way for listing to my music(s).Please get rid of the ads!
Best music app that ever existed
I enjoy the music and the station options, however, the commercials that come on after 2-3 songs is a bit ridiculous. This has caused me to limit my use of pandora and has caused me to seek other options for my listening.
I like pandora because if I’m cleaning my room I don’t have to go and change the song and become it has most of my favorite songs
👍🏼
Kooooool. Makes my Music therapy sessions Kooooool and my day better!!!. From😤to 😍
This app always crashes on me and my phone ain’t old. After about 20-30 mins it always crashes. Fix this and I will give 5 stars. Until then!
Love Pandora not many commercials plays great music
Would've been a five star head i not have to pay to get commercial free
Try the others come back to the best
I am having problems with stations that I saved and next thing they are gone it isn’t worth downloading
It's a great app; however, they don't seen to have an app for an Apple Desktop such as an iMac. I mean it has an app for every other Apple Device but not the desktop. I have also used Spotify which gives a way to fully integrate the music I've chosen through a patch you can install from online. However, Pandora only gives me the radio option on that I must sign in through the front site to access. So if they find a way to rectify this problem I'll throw in the last two stars.
This App is great. BUT it drains drains drains the battery on my iPhone 7p!?!? Since the upgrade it makes it unusable to me unless my phone is plugged in.

Simply too many ads. Used to be a better app but in the last year, or so, it seems they have increased the number of ads. Too many other options out there today.
I'm very grateful for this wide opposition of music, made available free variety of music for your soul mind an over all well being,to reconnect with our inner being,balance. People get caught up in what's in front them only what te eyes see not the Beautiful sounds of music an God great sounds of Mother Earth.
I totally enjoy my music on Pandora!!!❤️
I’m a music person, like a lot of you! Music can affect my demeanor from one min to the next. I want to thank Pandora for there wide variety of music, especially how they play music that’s “like” what you punch in. It’s like I grew up with these guys/gals. I remodeled an 1890 Victorian home.... took me 2.5 yrs to finish! Pandora was there for me to work through the ups and downs of the project! Didn’t matter what mood I was in, I would type in the song that was on my mind and the rest that followed were just as fitting! Great job guys!! Listen to all the time!! The day my family moved in we partied with pizza and Pandora! Forever will be a memory for me dancing around the house with my beautiful wife and my 2 boys, 3 and 8. Keep up the good work! Thanks!!!
The app Pandora is a great app but it does have its flaws. You get adds about upgrading to premium almost every 3 songs. I tried the free trial and it was great, but I don’t think it’s that useful to you unless you’re really enriched in Pandora or go on a lot of plane rides.
It's such a great way to stay up to date and relax with the old school music!!!
Songs I wanted to hear notified license issues No problem with Google play, Apple,Spotify.Love the setup however Spotify you can fade the music which sounds very nice.I will give it a month. 
DOWNLOAD IT NOW
Love Pandora radio 💕
I bought a pandora plus subscription to get rid of the awful ads that constantly pop up. The ads still play even after buying it and I am extremely upset. To make matters worse they automatically have you buy the 6 months subscription instead of letting you choose the month by month option which you can switch to afterwards which is misleading. It is a wonder pandora hasn’t been sued for false advertising yet.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing!

I’ve posted before and my issue never got resolved. Now I find that my review had beef deleted. Wow!!!   I find it unfair that there’s no searchable Russian music. Also, I keep running into errors - my feedback cannot be saved when I thumb up or thumb down a song. 
So wonderful to have all Broadway at my fingertips!
Kendrick Lamar/The Roots / Common / Rapsody Radio is Amazing
One of the best app ............thanks
I love the variety of music and how u can do other things without the music cutting off!!!DOWNLAD PANDORA!!!!!

I simply LOVE Pandora
Hey
It's so easy to use and play your own music
OMG LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!! I love listening to my favorite song these cheaters are AMAZING
I love hearing the top hit songs and listen to the real oldies it makes me want to dance on the dance floor
I wish I could replay all of Upchurch s song. But other than that it’s great. Great selection and wide range of artist like wheeler walker jr and Upchurch.
Was always a fan of Pandora. Then I got a new car. The Pandora app works great with my 2014 GMC Terrain, but I can’t plug in my phone to USB without it auto playing Pandora. Always Pandora, even if I haven’t touched Pandora in weeks. Sorry, this is a deal breaker. No setting on the car to turn off Auto Play, no setting in Pandora. So I need to either get rid of my car or get rid of the Pandora App. I realize this might not be Pandora’s fault, but deletion is my only solution.
With ads or not it's the best internet radio ever!! I love it!! I use it everyday on my IPhone 7 and use Bluetooth on my car stereo! It's awesome!  I also love the fact that the radio playlist is already LIT AF! But the fact that pandora knows exactly knows what I like and personalizes my playlist but also throws in NEW SONGS that are FIRE!! 
Very nice!
Keep making me have premium

I love pandora but why does it waste so much battery
I love all of the music options
This app keeps me in the groove. Whenever I’m feeling down and need a quick pick me up, music does it for me and this is my go app.
I honestly used to love Pandora. I pay monthly and everything. Recently the whole app went down hill. The same few songs are played over and over. I can tell you what song is coming next. Sometimes the app doesn’t even work properly. It will close and tell me it is unable to process my request. I am switching to Apple Music.
Pandora is Amazing ☺️
Pandora is the most awesome app of all the apps it’s so good to punch in your own music.  It’s such a pleasure to listen to through the Bluetooth Bose speaker portable.  Kindest regards

Minus stars for forcing me to rate it every time I try to do anything in-app
Great app easy to use. Really enjoy everyday.
Pandora used to work perfectly fine on my 2016 Honda Civic vía Bluetooth or a USB connection. The Pandora controls built into the car worked great. I was able to thumbs up/down a song directly from the vehicle’s media screen and I could select stations or skip songs directly from the media controls on the steering wheel. But since updating the app, it will no longer connect to my car! I’ve tried everything possible: unpairing/repairing my phone to the car, uninstalling/reinstalling the app, rebooting my phone etc and nothing works. Why would you “fix” something that’s not broken?   Also the constant upgrade pop ups are so annoying! Constantly shoving them in my face is not going to convince me to upgrade so please make it stop doing that. 
I love Pandora, I listen to it 10 hours a day. This is a good user friendly app and if decide on the pay services they are worth the price. Thank you!
It seems to have trouble staying hooked up with chromecast
I love Pandora premium I can listen to all my favorite music without commercials it’s amazing everyone should download this app thank you Pandora
The app is very nice but the only thing that it needs is that you can make your own list of track that you like.
Pandora gives me all the music I want and spotify won’t let me just play music because I’m only 12😩
Great tunes from a time gone by.
Cool
Me like it.😜
I’ve used Pandora loyally for 6 years now but I’m considering switching to a new platform. 7 months ago I signed up for Pandora Premium and have had little problems with Pandora as an app ever since. It crashes more often then before and my downloaded playlists don’t work have the time. If given the option to download a playlist I made I want to be able to listen to it offline but every time I click play it says that it’s unavailable. I find it hard to believe that of the 50 or so songs that I have in my playlist are all unavailable for playback because of licensing issues. Also on that same subject the playlist does work once, and that is the immediately after I download it but a couple hours later I get squat. The Help section of the app is not nearly as useful as I would like. I would like the option to send the developers a message letting them know something is wrong but no option. I love Pandora and it’s a great service but Premium isn’t worth the money.
It is a satisfying feeling when I am able to select every song or artist that can minister to my spirit. I really enjoy pandora
Pandora me acompaña todo el dia es la mejor app que existe 👍🏼🎼🎤🎧🥇😍

I upgraded to Premium. Now when Pandora is running my battery is completely drained within two hours. Even when it\'s not running, it appears that Pandora\'s background processes are doing a slow drain. I *love* Pandora, but hate that upgrading (and paying more) limits the my use of Pandia unless I\'m sitting next to a wall. Plus with the slow drain, I have to have a portable battery pack with me at an times just in case.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I truly love Pandora and their playlist but we could do with a little less commercials. I know nothing is free in life but give us a break.
I really enjoy the variety and exposure to musical artists that you would not get on traditional radio.
Best music system!
Replay option could work better
So many ads now
All good, all the time!
I love the idea that you can choose the type of music that you are in the mood to listen to.
Pandora won’t let me access it because it mistakenly reports I am in a country that Pandora does not serve.  But I am in the USA,as I have always been.

Needs to be an option to stop certain ads from playing. Some ads are fine but there are others that are inappropriate.
Great job
If you thumbs up ONE Spanish song, pandora thinks i don’t want to hear English songs. Calm down pandora, i just like the Spanish hook on ONE song
My entire phone died and I have talked to multiple people who attribute this issue to the pandora app. It’s been persnickety but this was ridiculous. Have cancelled my subscription and will never redownload. Yes, I realize I sound like one of those crazy internet people who has a bad haircut and an entitlement issue but this was INSANITY. Btw if this happens to you, hold down the power button, while pressing the up button and then hold the down button for 30 seconds. Then do yourself a favor and delete the pandora app.
I’m not going back because you don’t know how much you love them but I cannot I like you I want you all to love you  No I’m on mine right away I’m not sure I can get you a little later today or 
Is the best song ever had because I have become so really close to my music and I pay attention to it
Simple as that. Best $4.99/mo.
This app is AWESOME and when your phone turns off it still go’s
No I do not want to write a review.
It lets you listen to any song free and if you were wondering it does cuss
BRU YOU CAN LISTEN TO MUSIC WHILE U GO ON OTHER APPS
Love it
I pay $13 a month to be able to download what music I want and listen to it whenever I want. Every time I find a song I really like and try to listen to after downloading it the error comes “due to our licensing purposes this song is unavailable on playback” how frustrating! My app also glitches a lot and just randomly closes. I’m switching to Apple Music where I’ll pay less and not have to deal with all of the glitches and listen to the music I want.
Not sure what happened but lately pandora has been disconnecting from my google cast speakers whenever I leave the app and come back to it later.   Even does it when the phone goes to sleep and you go bs k into the app. Very frustrating, especially when it happens on a song you like. In order to continue casting it skips to the next song. Happens on Slackr, which is why I stopped using them. Would hate to quit using Pandora since algorithm is getting better.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Currently I pay to be able to download music, make playlists, and have no ads...it’s not worth it. Every single month (sometimes multiple times) I have to redownload everything. There are many days where I’m listening offline and can’t even access the music I’ve downloaded that I should be able to access. It’s not worth the annoyance and I’ll be canceling when this month is up.
Best music app I’ve had so far
The app crashes after about 10 minutes of use. Once it’s reopened the song will have started over and is playing with better clarity now. Just for that 1 song then it’s back to normal and crashes after 10-15 minutes of use.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Thank you awesome
Pandora always cuts off most Pink Floyd songs a minute in but everything else about Pandora is A ok.
I listen every day.
Had commercials when I pay for premium for 3 months. Wrote Pandora and never received a response. Would be higher if get what I paid for.
Best thing going since Pimping & Hoing!
Been enjoying Pandora for sometime, Thanks
I will say that Pandora has improved over the years. My wife and I were using Apple Music (I’ve been using it since it’s release) but we recently got a Google Home, so we changed music providers. I’ve been searching for the best one for me and have been experimenting with a couple. I would say I’d continue to use Pandora as my primary music service, provided they changed just 2 things.   1) Ability to sort songs, playlists etc. alphabetically. While this may not seem like a big deal to some, when you have the amount of music I do, I’d like to search alphabetically instead of just by recently added. It’s difficult to find MY songs the way it is now.   2) IF POSSIBLE, please incorporate gestures in the app. Again, maybe not a big deal to some people but I have small thumbs (yes that’s a thing lol) I’d like to be able to swipe down to get out of the now playing without having to adjust my phone to reach the top, etc.   I currently use Spotify as my primary, but the dark interface sometimes messes with my eyes. I love Pandora’s interface but if even just these 2 things change I will switch. 
Way to many adds.  !!!!!!!
The ads have turned me off a bit but the song selection still deserves 5 stars
I love my Pandora
Dude, I\'m tellin ya, this app makes me go bonkers. I started paying for Pandora Premium and I swear every time I choose a song to play and I\'m getting all into it and dancing....the song just randomly and oh so suddenly out of nowhere STOPS sometimes 20-50 seconds and it starts playing a different song on that same playlist. And I constantly have to restart because it never fails to freeze up. But I swear, the song randomly changing is by far enough to make me stop paying for Premium. Might as well just use the free Pandora and listen to ads....unless that one changes songs 30 seconds in too......  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing!

I won’t pay extra for no advertising, so it is a necessary evil for free listening. Some of the songs don’t seem to fit with the chosen genre or artist, but thumbs down works for those.
I wish you could shuffle ALL STATIONS, and play individual songs.
This audio is so low quality! I get better music quality from YouTube. Also, quit with the ads!
Always has my favorite music
This is a very easy app to hear the music that I love
I love using pandora, I use it everyday. I have plus and I would like it more if it were easier to choose our offline playlists. That’s the only reason for 4 stars.
Got the premium trial and lost all options of app. Cancelling tomorrow as I am unable to tonight for some reason. Bummer.
Great variety
Su app es un éxito.
Awesome listening
Hey 👋 my name is Brad and I will work on the next time I can get on pandora to try to make it work.
It is the best 😘, it know what I want to listen to! LOVE YOU PANDORA 🤟🏻🤩😘
You should have like types of different thumbprints like one for only Mexican and other for hip hop etc.
It is amazing I find all the music I want in here 🤪🤪
Beautiful and memorable music to listen to !
I would like to listen to the Doobie Brothers and hearing anything but. I realize their music spanned a broad spectrum but not as broad as what’s being played. There is enough to select from either the Tom Johnston or Michael McDonald eras that it’s not necessary to included too many other artist
It’s good but needs works
Greater than any app !!♥️
I'll give Pandora 5 star without interruptions of any kind. For now, 2 Stars is good, and probably too much.
Dear pandora you are the best, your glitches are minors to me. Thank you for teaming one the best and free.
That’s all I wanted to say
Love Pandora❤️
Pandora is a great app but I think people should not have to pay to remove adds because every time you like a song a commercial plays😤😡. But other than that HUGE problem pandora is a good app!!!
As if you stole all my albums
Pandora has some of the best music I’ve been able to listen to they just need to add a little more of comedy and more great artists but by far the best
Awesome!
lo mejor
Great music on the shuffle. Thank you hard rock oldie and country!!
They have very few adds and when you use a app it still plays music. I love that it’s free, even though you don’t pay them they still have all the     newest songs. So get the free app and pay them with good ratings.👌🏼🎶🎶🎶🎵🎶🎶🎶 
I love pandora 🎃😎
I love pandora music. I don’t mind the advertising because I know that’s how you keep the music coming. So I take the good with the bad. If I had to pay for it I would not. I am old school and like listening to the radio or pandora which is free.
Love it but I would love it more if it didn’t skip on its own . Other than that ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Enjoy that it’s free!
Love it epic music keep the tunes flowing .....
I’ve been using Pandora for about 2 years now and I LOVE it- it has great songs on stations and also in a way you have unlimited skips and rewinds. Which is just AMAZING in my opinion🙂
Great for my jams
Still waiting on a fix for the alarm feature. Also, can you please kill the Facebook login screen that pops up every time I load Pandora. No, I don’t want to login to Facebook. I want to listen to Pandora. Also, looks like this is the alarm problem. It pops up when my alarm is active and it cuts off.   Be RESPONSIVE!!!!!!!!  Is this ever going to be fixed? It worked for years until a recent update broke it. Contacted support weeks ago about this issue, but no progress.  Updating on 1/23/18. Moving up to 3 stars. Alarm finally works again. Hooray! Still have that goofy Facebook login screen every time I launch, but that’s an easy “x” out. Just annoying. Also, still way too many ads. 
I’m unhappy with a recent update where the music stops playing often when you transition between audio devices such as Bluetooth and headphone jack. The app forces you to unlock your device and open the pandora app to restart your station, and often times repeatedly bugs you with the same dialogs requiring you to dismiss them, sometimes navigating you away from your stations to some other screen.   In effect the iPhone control center (swipe up from bottom) that allows you to pause and play your music often times will not work with pandora and you’re forced to open the app, dismiss a dialog and find your station again.   This is a regression in usability of the app, and my guess is pandora did this in an attempt to reduce the amount of data they stream to you.   Annoying. 
Still like the stations I create on Pandora better than Spotify.
Pandora always restarts my iPhone 7
Use it everyday. Even upgraded. The only thing missing is the ability to turn the screen horizontally on my iPhone. Come on folks, make it happen!
I am very upset with Pandora. I have tried for hours now to unsubscribe or delete my account because I am being charged from Pandora and you have to go through all this crap just delete your own account or cancel a subscription.

I paid the 4.99 for ad free and unlimited skips,I’m lucky if it plays any songs,it keeps dropping me and putting me offline.when I’m not happy with what’s playing and I start skipping it will only let me skip 8 songs before it tells me my station is no longer active and find a new station. ha! some unlimited skips,if I’m listening to Pink Floyd radio I certainly don’t want to hear music from the bay city rollers,I want my Pink Floyd radio to play Pink Floyd.i dropped the upgrade and now I’m considering dropping pandora and go back to Xm radio at least I got what I paid for.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Been with Pandora Plus for a while now, recently upgraded to Premium. Very happy and loving it! It’s super easy to navigate and figure out how to use. Also I went camping with no cell service and downloaded a bunch of albums before I went. Worked great and had a ton of music. Thanks!!! Keep up the fuego app
I have an iPhone 6s and every couple songs pandora makes my phone restart. it’ll be playing a song and out of nowhere it restarts my phone. I don’t know why it does this but please fix it !!!
I always use Pandora because they always play my best music
Great
Is great
There is so much potential for Pandora but they just miss on a lot of small things.   First of all no family plan option is terrible.   Constantly having to open the app, then close it and reopen is irritating. I cannot pause the song or mute with Bluetooth unless I close it and reopen it.   The other issue is that they boast about how “smart” their app is in filtering music and finding good matches for you yet I will hear the same songs come up while at the gym and driving to work as I did the previous day, which were even 👍🏿.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：We appreciate all the feedback!

It’s like a treasure of all he music we forgot about that brings back so many memories
This used to be a good app, no longer. Full of commercials and you’re lucky to hear 2 songs before you are hearing a 15 to 30 second ad. Then all they do is push their subscription service. This company deserve to be shut down and all the employees out of work due to the excessive greed.
Mellow and out there thinking path
To many ads
Great app all my favorite songs at the touch of a button. I love it!
only suggestion is it should include a thumbs up/down option from the control center
I LOVE MY PANDORA!! I EXIT THIS APP AND MUSIC STILL PLAYS WHILE YOU DO OTHER THINGS ON YOUR PHONE!!! LOVE... LOVE....LOVE!!! 
Hands down the best free music streaming app on the market. Unfortunately I'm having issues with the phone resetting intermittently, at any given time after the app opens.
I like pandora but recently when I select shuffle my thumbs up it repeats the same several songs (songs I have given the thumbs up) along with new songs in the same vein. The new stuff is ok but why keep repeating the one or two songs over and over from my list of 302 songs. My other issue is I live in an area where reception comes and goes between my commute to and from work...so I downloaded quite a few songs. I wish I could select offline mode but I can’t. So I will be rocking out and when the song comes to an end I have sudden total silence while it connects “buffers” for the next 10 minutes. Instead of just going into off line mode and playing my downloads. So my question are they truly downloaded? Why else would the app keep searching “buffering”. If you live in a non rural area I am sure you don’t even notice but us Northern California coastal towns do! I end up switching to google play. As I want to rock out before I have a hectic day working at the local hospital or going home to take care of my three awesome teenagers and hubby!
So many great memories brought back to life by hearing this great app. Well worth it
They play too many adds
Pandora is Amazing! !! !
I love pandora but my school has terrible internet do you think you could make a feature with music you can listen to without WiFi
I love comedy thanks for making me laugh all of the time I love listening to Jim and Brian and they are so funny I am a big fan of comedy I would listen to it all of the time  Good job pandora on every station  I love pandora I will always listen to comedy I would laugh for hours listen to comedy 
It’s awesome
It’s a great app
pandora.....great music
Talk about a hard push to get a person to rate the app. I give it five stars because I use Pandora constantly and it does exactly what I want a music player to do and nothing else.   If all you want is for somebody else to pick the music based on a song or band you like, with the least effort on your part, this is the right music app for you. 
Work,play & stufff Can’t wait till I get paid half a penny a song

Pandora is the main reason why I didn’t renew my Sirius subscription.  The quality of music through Pandora is far superior to satellite radio and you can customize what music to your taste.  Great app.
I can listen to songs I love anywhere, anytime for free. You also get to fine-tune your radio to yout favourite songs.
Opened the app and got signed up for a $12/mo sub. That they wont let me cancel so about to start law suits instead.
Love that I can create and delete channels. I wish that I can select multiple channels to play instead of playing the shuffle channel.
Y'all got my house jamming out! Peace and love ✊🏿
I have used Pandora free for a few years and have been relatively pleased with the function of the app. I didn't mind hearing a few ads occasionally between the songs on my stations...until the ads became inappropriate. I contacted Pandora twice to complain about ads with inappropriate content or foul language and never received a proper response to my concerns. I have children at home that do not need to hear some of the things these ads were saying. All responses I received were canned/template emails that were meant to pacify my complaint but did nothing to truly address my concerns and I was left hanging with no response to how Pandora was going to fix the issue. I never did get a hold of a real person or have a one-on-one response. This leaves me the impression that Pandora does not care about their "free" listeners' experience, and can't be bothered to properly respond to their concerns. These canned emails literally said "no ads, no Pandora"....which I understand, but I think it should be the company's duty to consider "no listeners, no Pandora" first. It certainly seems that they value the advertisers over the listeners. I may not be a "paying" customer, but if you offer a free service, those customers shouldn't be treated second-rate. Even if I elected to still listen to Pandora, I would not give them my money for the utter disregard they showed me. I have deleted Pandora and am going to find another music streaming service that actually values my clientele.
I really like pandora the only thing that I wish is that we could listen to that one person that you in the mood for but I also love the radio.
No problem with audio ads on my free Pandora.  They are just too frequent.

Nice app I love it 😍 it is so fun and good! Hi there 
🔥Flame
So I have premium but some songs won’t play at all? I’m more curious as to why then anything else. For the longest time I could play any artists new music without any trouble but suddenly no matter how I try new music will not play
Love the choices and can’t enough of all kinds of music!
These are station that I like I enjoy the old school , there is nothing like it for me personally
I just love Pandora!  Thumbs up your favorites and thumbs down to get rid of what you don’t like.  It’s your own customized station!  Keep up the good work Pandora!
I loved using pandora yet lately in the mornings my pandora app will not play (will say buffering and/or change station). I\'ve had to uninstall and reinstall the app at least 4 times within a three day span. Also, now it won\'t even let me reinstall. I was interested in investing in the pandora premium since Spotify wasn\'t the greatest fit for me, yet after these problems it\'s made me realize I should maybe invest my money in something much more reliable.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’ve been experiencing!

Pandora introduces me to new music
I love it just do lol
I’m trying my best to understand why I am paying for the premium package and I am constantly unable to listen to my music. I download music and the songs end up disappearing off my list of songs. If I skip a song (that I have downloaded) and I skip it too many times, it will just pause the song and be stuck playing the same song until I hit shuffle again. And now currently my Pandora is not playing music at all, it’s been “buffering” since yesterday since the update. I will be ending my subscription shortly. This is ridiculous.
I already pay for a “premium” account for $6/month yet your application persistently asks if I’d like to upgrade to your ridiculous $13/month option WHILE MUSIC IS PLAYING. Obviously your developers recognize that people dismiss pop-ups like that quickly and you’ve discovered that many people are either too foolish or lazy to learn or rebut the inadvertent upgrade. This is borderline fraudulent to allow this to occur. Oh, what’s that you say? Users still must verify their Apple Pay? Hmm pretty simple to do with fingerprint now don’t you think? I’ve had it happen to me now twice and I’m about to file a more formal complaint against this deceptive and unethical business practice. Fix this issue.
To many cormmercial , they just force you way too much
I tried Pandora Premium and I was shocked how awesome it was and I never want to go back to free account but I do not want to pay for premium. If you guys make the premium free like the normal pandora everyone from soundcloud and other apps will come over to pandora. Or at least make the same theme for the people who can’t afford premium. This is the reason I only used SoundCloud the past month because u can skip, replay, rewind, like, make playlists for absolutely free, so if you guys make it the way premium is for free it will be the best Streaming app ever and you will have more income then ever from people moving to Pandora That is premium but free right away Or at least make the same theme for the people who can’t afford premium please 
Quit bugging me to rate this app! 1 star until I can “thumbs up” from the iPhone lock screen! 
Love Pandora!
I have premium and lately after the new update it continues to crash.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I enjoy Pandora premium all day long, 7 day’s a week.  I enjoy listening to the commercial-free unlimited stream of any genre I can think of.  Reasonable price   HOWEVER-  1) I’ll sometimes search for stations, and the songs that are offered miss completely.  I’ve had to delete several all thumbs-down stations.  I’ll test Spotify or SoundCloud and they seem to hit when Pandora misses.  2) I REALLY WISH I could ORGANIZE my own stations into folders and subfolders  (i.e. my WORK stations; or my DATE NIGHT stations; or “romantic” date night vs. “fun” date night stations 
Just took a ride with my kids in the car, turned on Pandora and heard an ad for Adam and Eve adult products. I have never used that website and to be honest I am very disappointed that it would pop up in the ad rotation.  I can’t think of a setting where this would be a nice thing to hear while listening to my stations on Pandora, I know that the ads support the stations but can’t they tailor the ads?  Is that too much to ask?
Thank you Pandora for bringing back a-z alphabetical sort for stations!  He music service is awesome, but for several months it was SUPER frustrating to use without that feature.
From my experience on using Pandora, I have to say it’s quite good and has an exceptional array of songs for people with different tastes in music choice. However I think it would be nice if I could access the special privileges without having to pay money, but that’s not possible I imagine, Overall, I would recommend Pandora to others if I do get the chance.
lol you need to get pandora now!!!
I like the app from the start. But then they gave me premium for 1 month free. And infinite skips and ad free just made the app way better. If u can have those free to begin with i would gave this app 5 star.
They only play panic every few songs and mostly studio versions.
Chilis ad is annoying....... So are the others but that one tops it 
The app keep freezing mid playing after this new update on iOS and android devices pandora need to rectify the situation  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Pandora is the best station
Every time I go on for the first time in a couple hours it will play like three songs and then my screen turns black and I have to wait a couple seconds then go back onto the app and then whatever song I was on it restarts. I’ve been dealing with this for a while waiting for an update to work but nothing is and I really love Pandora!!!!
Go get this app I really enjoy playing music and they only make you listen to ads to get replays or skip a song
Pandora is my go to music app and it’s really easy to operate and not many adds
I took the plunge and tried the premium service. The music on demand is great. Being able to download hours of music on WiFi for on the go without having to use LTE sealed the deal. The sound quality of the premium is superb. Highly recommend it.
Excelente
Pandora has the Best Music
I used to love this app but nowadays all my favorite stations crash and say that they are currently unavailable after a few songs every time I listen to them. And still don’t work after I restart the app.
I’ve really enjoyed (free) Pandora over the years. My only complaint is that it seems to play the same songs over and over, no matter what station I’ve selected. My gut tells me they’ve restricted/modified the “free” version over the years to entice users to upgrade.
All day 24:7.  Message music galore s.  Keep coming
Pandora is definitively very iPhone friendly.
They have it set up so the option to buy premium moves down slightly after it pops up and you accidentally hit it with your thumb every time  I know you did this on purpose pandora, F UXK YALL 
Absolutely luv Pandora Radio. It’s the Best
Love the mix
Poor song selections+giving a thumbs down,take away from your skips!?! Also,you select a station and 5 songs play before you hear a song from the artists station you've selected!?!
Love it. It’s all I listen to
The only thing that gets me through work day 😘
I love Pandora, it ROCKS!
Even if you don’t pay for it. It customizes your radio to perfection just give it the likes and dislikes and it’s perfect afterwards
Love it !!
Me gustaría poder tener acceso a Pandora cuando estoy fuera del país
I paid the $40 a year for unlimited hours and no ads!  I love the stations I built!  I listen to Pandora 1 every night.  After having pandora for years(since inception), I need to change my rating.

I wish they’d update stations or modify the algorithms so the stations wouldn’t play the same songs every 5-10 minutes.   Also lots of glitches. Pandora won’t respond and freezes a lot. Might be time for a switch. 
Awesome music all day long. Right now with Deadmau5 radio station!!!!
Love!
Pandora is a great music radio
Love it a lot!
I’ve used Pandora since it came out over ten years ago. It started out as the best free music playing app. Adds and commercials quickly changed that. Currently for every two songs, they play two adds. These adds are not selective or able to be fast-forwarded to the end. They are also extremely distracting (alarm clock sounds, warning sounds, and even iPhone alerts sounds) anything to take your attention away.  I use Pandora to help study and cover up the surrounding sounds. Now Pandora is more distracting than the surroundings.  Also the “pushy” upgrade to the paid program never goes away. If I press “Not Now” 3000 times, please stop offering it.  If I hear a song I like and want to interact with Pandora to thumbs-up or screenshot the album information, Pandora quickly blocks the album art and shows an advertisement. If I click like or dislike a song, it shoves the upgrade in my face. If I skip or dislike a song more than a few seconds into the beginning, counts it as a listen and usually gives me another add/commercial. Pandora makes the add volume much louder than the songs, so you have to mute or lower the volume on the add and hope to turn it back on/up before the beginning of the next song.  Strong dislike for Pandora. I guess it’s all about money and not user satisfaction. One Star! 
I've had Pandora for years now, but lately have been very unhappy with the app. There is more ads than ever, and they are longer than ever, sometimes 35 seconds long. There are usually 2 or even 3 ads in a row. The app crashes regularly. As if this wasn't enough, when I logged in today, I was suddenly missing half of my stations. I had 22 stations, I now have 7. They have all been deleted somehow. I'm very unsatisfied.
The pandora service remains wonderful. Suddenly the app is broken. If I swipe over to a previously played song and give it the thumbs-down, the currently playing song stops and a new one starts. So who knows if my thumbs down went toward the previous song or the currently playing one, but either way, the song I was listening to and enjoying suddenly stops because I was giving the thumbs-down to something that played before. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯   I prefer Pandora over other services, and use it several hours almost every day, but I’m about ready to switch to something else because the app is just getting worse. 
Been using apple music,spotify and Pandora and by far Pandora is the best one specially the radio stations,if i want to here Bad Bunny radio station that’s mean i want to hear just latin trap music and NOT all kind of music specially in English
Thank you for making Bluetooth work again!  Past few months have been a terror.  App locks up, sometimes while still playing, requiring a force close.  Happens often, but most often if BT tries to reconnect when Pandora is not in foreground.  Happened on iOS 10 and 11.   Please fix the app as it is becoming too much trouble to use.    Thankfully, Spotify offered me a 3 month trial for a buck so I have an alternate.  I want to stick with Pandora, but I’m losing patience. 
Love it
I used to subscribe online but switched to the app for convenience. The app charges more for the same service ($5.99 vs $4.99 for upgraded listening and $12.99 vs $9.99 for premium). I have subscribed to the basic paid version for years and I’ve been a member for a least a decade or more. Ever since premium came out it offers the chance to upgrade multiple times per day. I don’t want the premium and always hit ignore except once recently when my thumbprint activated the purchase.  So then I had charges for both plans (no refunds or pro-rating occurring just days apart on my account. I then tried to cancel immediately but the app won’t let you cancel and tells you to go to the App Store but there isn’t any clear way to cancel through the App Store either. Pandora does not have a help section online where you can actually work with a rep. Instead I had to contact Apple and ask them to cancel the subscription. Then according to the website you can restart a subscription and pick the new plan that you prefer. So upon starting the app again it asked me if I wanted to subscribe again and it automatically put me in the $12.99  category. So now I’m back where I was with something i don’t want that i can’t cancel and i will have been charge $32 this month for music due to Pandora’s awful system. Frustrated and deeply annoyed I’m ready to cancel for good which is very disappointing given how much I like the music service. 
So much better than iTunes recommend
Go get this!
I love that I rarely need to skip on my set radio stations!
I love pandora for so many uses, daily escape, workout, comfort listening at work or let’s get this party started.  Thank you Pandora you’re a big part of my daily life.
My ads just keep repeating every so often and I get 12 minutes of non stop ads... the same ad... please fix this.

Pandora Rocks free Music and enjoyable remembrance of the song is your love.
I can listen to songs on this app for hours. My only issue is that they’ve upped the price for premium and upped the ads. I can deal with it. It’s up to you to decide if you can to.
Love it
Believe it!!!!
Enjoy all of the station options. So much fun when driving and also at home!
I’m pleased with how they replay your thumbs up a lot so you get to hear more of the music you love!
This app is horrible if you don’t have premium. Way too many ads to make it even enjoyable. It seems as though their main goal is to get you to get premium and pay the monthly subscription fee. That’s how bad the ads have gotten. I do not recommend the free app to anyone. If you use this with intent to buy the subscription, just save yourself the trouble & frustration and purchase the monthly sub.
Awesome
MUSIC MEVER FAILS TO MAKE ME HAPPY
I love the app! I do! I just wish online Play was as loud as Offline! I love how the offline sounds in my car!! Please make it louder! Then, you’ll get 5 stars from me!!Thank you!!
Not sure why the app crashes after 15 minutes of play. This just started happening and is very frustrating. Please fix.
I wish there was a timer to stay on so my phone want die when I go to sleep
Love this site
I love the update where it changed everything and it was a lot more organized I could listen to my music that I thumbed up but they changed it back to the original and I’m not very fond of if
Very happy
It won’t connect with the google Crome stick. I use to always use my phone to listen to music and now I have to use my iPad.  Very frustrating!
I was listening to my fav song and out of no were it stopped and won’t continue btw I have signal were I am also fast WiFi
I love the music but I don’t need all the swearing. I went in my settings and disabled explicit content and I’m still getting the swearing.
I needed rest music and workout music and Pandora was recommended to me. I love it! Pandora has it all.
Free pandora rocks!!!!
Best music app on the market
For a free app it’s great
This is great for music and it never gets tired except for the fact that sometimes it over plays the same song a lot, it gets annoying over time to be honest
Sometimes pauses and adds get in the way, but hey, it's FREE! So... can't complain.
I have used the basic pandora selection for years now. I guess my only complaint is it seems like the music data bank isn’t very extensive. I also don’t like whatever program/ algorithms etc that Pandora uses. For example when I want to rock out to David Bowie (on my dedicated David Bowie channel) it DOESN’T mean I want to listen to “Help” from the Beatles next. If the only way those two are grouped together because your data bank links two artists/groups together from England who happened to be performing the same years- that’s HORRIBLE!! They’re not the same genres! It’s pretty much the same complaint for all my channels. I’m sure you’ll tell me that prime or whatever is better. Oh yeah...and why can I only skip so many songs a day? Stop grouping them together poorly and I’ll stop skipping them.   Thanks, Ron Jojola 
Excellent service if not the best out there. Great job Pandora !!! Just waiting till I get the chance to curate a station.
I listen to hours and hours of pandora  Once you get your stations set it is great 
If I’m Pandora in the back while running running Apps, Files or Games. Pandora will force shutdown my phone and and Apple logo appears to reboot. Have then load manual password, wont let me use fingerprint and will closed all Apps down. I will fix the Rating when you fix this problem.
It’s a good app, but I see know point in it. You could just go on YouTube if you wanna listen to music.
My account isn’t even popping up on my mobile. It’s giving me the option to add a station. I already have my stations, I’m not trying to create a new profile.

It the best source of music in the net. For me it’s the best. Love it
Update: problem described below is now fixed.  It took just about 3 months though to fix it-I even wrote up a detailed problem description ticket and provided it to Pandora, only to be told they were working on it- so I dealt with 3 months of subpar performance which I paid for.  I’m only increasing to 2 stars since I’m sure this will happen again.  Sound quality is still pretty inconsistent for paying customers - some songs are 192kps, but clearly not all.  I now give them 2.5 stars, up from 1.  Just as another example of an issue - I was willing to upgrade to Premium from Plus....well there is no option for that.  I believe I have to cancel my Plus-who knows whether I get a prorated refund for my months which were unused-then buy a year Premium subscription.  I also wanted to try the free Premium trial, but I get just a simple spinny wheel which doesn’t confirm anything.  Not sure if I’m subscribing my to this again and may go back to playlists and mp3s again.    Original review— Pandora used to work pretty well with my Alpine CDE W265BT head unit, but ever since the update from about 3 weeks ago (November 17), now the app never works on first try. I always plug in the lightning cable instead of Bluetooth for better audio quality - so it’s pretty unacceptable and disappointing that a modern iPhone 8 and head-unit advertised to work with Pandora do not properly work together.  I now must enter the Pandora app, then close it out, then plug it into my head unit in order for music to play.  It used to be seamless operation, but now it’s just terrible and distracting.  Oh...and usually after a Pandora update, which seems to be weekly, it’s your responsibility to go into settings and set the audio quality back to High again since it usually defaults back low quality.    The music stations also constantly play the same 20 or so songs— it’s like having that same mix cd playing the same music all the time. Despite the claims of creating a curated playlists for paying customers (like me)..its still the listener’s responsibility to constantly tell the app that a song had been played too much (which is a buried setting/feature).  The thumbs up and down is flat out ignored in some cases. 
Pandora is fvckinnnn LIT TODAY!!
BRING BACK THE SONG PREVIEWS!! defeats the whole purpose if I can't preview songs and customize my stations. Gonna start using other music streaming services. Oh but of course the HD ads load in right away
Since the latest update, it takes a lot of work to make offline playlists work. Offline playlists won’t play unless I 1) quit and restart the app 2) turn offline mode off 3) start the playlist 4) turn offline mode back on 5) start the playlist again. Occasionally, these steps have to be gone through more than once to get an offline playlist to work. I’ve gone back to listening to Apple Music, because it takes too much work to get an offline playlist to play when I’m trying to get in the car and leave.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I pay for pandora every month, and every month there is a new issue!! Recently—I get an error message that pandora isn’t supported “in this country”—-I LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES IN A MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREA.

Every update I’m hopeful that Pandora will fix the issues on the playback on iPhone X. I’m a premium member and I can’t play 75% of the songs. They act like they’re playing but no sound comes out - not on phone speaker not in headphones not on Bluetooth. I have to skip over 75% of the songs because they are frozen and don’t play anything.   I’m about to cancel my membership I didn’t pay to listen to silence.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’ve been experiencing!

Pandora you sexy thing, your the therapy s person could buy. Thanks for staying super awesome and keeping the stars alive and well through their listeners.👊💕🦋🎼🌸🎻🍻🎻🌹🥁🌻🎸❤️
Downloaded this cause it’s the bees knees outta 9.
Can't relisten anything
I've discovered many artists that are new to me listening to Pandora. I would give it 5 stars if Pandora played the featured artist of the station more often.
I love pandoraaaa OMG!!
Music that you loved then you other music you loved forever even more pandora has it
Best music app ever
It has the best songs and stations and its my go to music app 🙂
I still like Pandora for radio stations better than the other streaming services I subscribe to.  iPhone X support isn’t good though. The tops of albums are cut off and way too much empty space in the middle.  Also stop asking me to subscribe to your full streaming service. Take no for an answer. 
😍😍❤️❤️
Upgraded to the premium service and have had some issues. The navigation is HORRIBLE!  There is no home button that I'm aware of and if you keep searching for artist you have to keep pressing back back and back to get to the original menu. It's a roll of the dice every time you update. Might fix your problems you have or might cause new problems.  I'm happy with the music selection though
Love this free app !!!
I pay 15$ dollar a month for pandora premium and it is definitely worth it. I have over 550* songs downloaded and if I would’ve downloaded those songs on iTunes it would be Way expensive, so I strongly recommend this app.
Pandora has stations that you can create and stations that you can search up and they will be there! Pandora Premium is also out now and you can search any song and play it!  AMAZING APP!!!  Negative note: It gets kind of annoying when you can’t skip anymore. You have to watch an ad for more skips which not everyone wants to do. 
Easily one of the smartest decisions I ever made. Makes time at work flyby
so many amazing stations, definitely recommended!!
Love pandora I listen to comedy for 8-15 hours a day as a mobile government mechanic...  just wish there was more variety per station! Lots of repeats... but I still love it
Love it 💯🔥.
I use the Pandora app while I’m at work to listen to music with my coworkers, but for some reason the same ad for Adam & Eve adult store keeps coming up and there’s no way to report it or skip it. (And I don’t shop there so there’s no reason for the ads.) I don’t understand why I can’t report an ad for being inappropriate/NSFW or at least request to not hear it again. This ad does not belong on this platform, period.   Severely disappointed by this blatant disregard to professionalism and common courtesy. 
The app is stable.
Awesome selections of music
If you are meditating don’t use pandora’s music, it will pop ads in the middle of your meditation
Great except for the ads.

Where do I start? It seems like the mobile QA team responsible decided to take a week off from the product release cycle, because the newest update is trash. Seriously.  Test your code? Nah. We’re Pandora. We care about obnoxious pop ups that ask users to rate the app every time you thumb  up a song, or skip a song. 
I love pandora it's a brilliant way to personalize and find brilliant music ;) cheers to pandora:)  Update: been waiting for the iPhone X upgrade it’s beautiful !!!!!!! Thank you !!!!!!!!!!!

I love creating my stations and hearing similar music, not too many commercials on the classical stations, a few too many on the more popular stations. I’m not technically inclined and pandora is simple to use. Am planning to upgrade soon so I won’t have to deal with commercials. Love hearing my music, thank you.
I really like it but it is a little pricy for the premium
Great
Free music, decent algorithms, all i ask for
I Love Everything about Pandora..... It’s nothing like it.... Class By It Self
Hate the add other than that is awasome.👌🏼
I come home and turn on Pandora to give me peace of mind and soul  It knows what I love, it makes my day go by fast and full of happiness  Love Pandora app 
Something that I suggest you add to Pandora is a rating system or a comment section for each song. You should do this because if a song is new to you and you don’t know whether to use a skip or to listen to it, you can either see how many stars it has or you can look at other people’s feedback on the song.
Ever time i get a notification from snapchat or open another app it pauses😐. This is very annoying it needs to be fix!!!
Good music

The variety and accessibility!
I love pandora gets me through my nights on the way to work🤸🏾‍♂️🤸🏾‍♂️💯💯
Although the title may be true, an undeniable increase in amount of ads have led me to love Pandora a little less.
The music helps me to get through the day!! Thank you!! 
Love it the best nothing can top this #awesomeness love
I've been using Pandora almost exclusively for music for the last six or seven years. Easy to use, infinitely useful. Good for listening to old favorites or exploring new music. I started with two stations- one for ABBA in general and one specifically based on RunDMC's "Tricky". Now I have somewhere around thirty stations. 10/10, would recommend, you won't regret it.
I have been enjoying this app for years and it’s FREE! It’s so easy to search for songs or singers. Thanks Pandora!
I used to love pandora, but now it keeps stopping within the first few mins of listening and I have to re-boot the app, then it does it again! I tried all the troubleshooting things and none of that worked... guess I’ll switch to something else  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing!

I love this app, it’s perfect for finding all your songs, without the price. Although in order to listen to some songs ‘Pandora Premium’ songs, require you to sign up for Pandora Premium or watch an ad, which are usually 15 seconds long, I feel like they should reduce the ad times, or reduce the amount of songs that require that.   Thanks so much for reading my suggestion! Love the app!

This is a reeeally nice app. Just wish they wouldn’t play so many adds to try to get u tk upgrade. But other than that a great app
Watch app needs some work. Commands such as volume adjustment, skipping songs, or selecting new station is slow.

I previously loved this app. Used it everyday in my studio. Thought the concept was awesome but apparently if you don\'t eventually upgrade to pay, it will just shut down on you. For 2 months I\'ve tried logging in and everyday it just freezes on the main loading screen. Thought the updates would fix this but that doesn\'t seem to be the case. If you are looking to enjoy music without paying don\'t use this app. It\'s a waste of time.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing!

Every time I get a a notification from Snapchat my pandora shuts off and I have to reopen the app every time. I have tried to delete both apps and it still does it every time. I’m also paying for this app and I’m not going to continue to pay for something that’s going to force close every time I get a notification!
Outstanding app gets me through the workday, and lets me chill and relax on the weekend! Love it
Please please please, listen to the thumbs down when a certain Song doesn’t belong in that genre or radio. Also fix it where IF i put thumbs down, then Dont Play that song anymore PLEASE. On several occasions it keeps playing songs that were disliked several times! And also IF a song is Disliked for One radio station, DONT block it completely from the other stations. It may be a song that belongs in a certain station, but Not in another. I’ve been paying for pandora for quite some time. Fix these things. It’s annoying.  Also please please please!! STOP playing the Same songs OVER and OVER and OVER and OVER again. Just cause i liked it doesn’t mean I want to hear it every time I select that station. It feels like its plays the same 5 songs every single time and inhave to skip. P.S. why and I limited to skips??? Im paying for this app. I should not be limited to skips! And if you have to limit my skips the Fix your App so I wont have to!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble.

Who was the idiot who took out the ability to sort my stations alphabetically?????  This is an ability we have known how to do since fifth grade.  I have over 30 stations and it would be nice to find what I am looking for.
With all the options for music streaming I would think pandora app would be the cutting edge app....but it’s not. The iPhone app freezes constantly....and co Stanton asking to upgrade to premium? Is just irritating. Even with Apple Watch series 3 you need your phone to operate the app. Get with the times and I will give a better review.
All my jams be playing at the right be having me all in my feelings
I love the commercial free station. I should have switched a long time ago. I love the playback function songs back on your list.
The app would be cool if I didn’t have to delete it and download it again every few days. The app crashes and even rebooting your phone won’t work. Other than that it’s pretty decent.
Love it!
Can’t express how much I love pandora. My daughter turned me on to it years ago for Christmas music and from there I discovered symphonic metal!!! I didn’t even know it existed and now it’s about all I listen to. Thanks pandora, I❤️ u not radio.
I like this app
As others have mentioned, I also experience the app freezing sometimes when I open it. The only thing that seems to fix it is to force close the app. Additionally, it would be nice to see iPhone X support.
I love
Bien
Otherwise the app and choice of selections are excellent.
Can get your choices of music to play and O just live that

Love listening when I’m driving but no option to thumb up a song when driving??? Just says pandora?? No worries 👍👍😍 
It’s music anytime anywhere
I like it
Love it!!
Love this app!!!
Pandora needs an update for a stand alone app compatible with the Apple Watch Series 3 Cellular. If I lose Bluetooth connection with my actual phone pandora will not work because it uses the app on my phone although I have the add on installed my watch. The point of having cellular on the Apple Watch is if you are out of range on Bluetooth with your phone you can still text, call, email etc from the watch. Would be nice to enjoy my pandora premium out on a walk with the dog without my phone and using my AirPods or out for a jog. iTunes does support a stand alone app for the watch so you can listen to music through AirPods without connection to your phone. Another benefit I would get here would be the usage of battery using pandora on my watch vs phone. I get home from a long day of work and my watch is at 80% and my phone is at 20% and that is off and on wireless charging all day. One of my coworkers opted for the iTunes unlimited subscription and I’m getting jealous for sure...
Only gripe I have is that the app will play a song for several seconds then skip it automatically which has happened a couple times. Possibly something they can fix on an update eventually.
To many commercials
This week, my Pandora app started launching and randomly playing out of the blue. This happens even after force closing and there is no immediate way to stop it except silencing my phone. Super frustrating and inconvenient as it has happened twice at work. After a google search it seems this was happening to some other folks last year. I would really appreciate a fix and/ or a reply about how to avoid this.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for the trouble you are experiencing - this is something we are actively looking into.

I just started my trial of pandora plus and I’ve only had it since the year started, and I am genuinely disappointed because of how many times the app crashes. Whenever the app crashes I have to restart the app and the song that was playing. These crashes happen when I visit other apps or pause the song I’m listening to for more than a couple minutes. I wouldn’t have a problem with this if I could just go back to the app without it having to restart and just play the song from where I left off. Maybe it’s the Bluetooth headphones I’m using that are causing the app to crash so much, but it’s been crashing long before I ever purchased them (it just didn’t seem to happen as frequently). If there are any solutions, I would like to know, because as of right now I’m going to switch to Spotify after my trial if these crashes continue to occur.
Pandora has almost every single genre, song, and artist you could ever come up with. The songs are good quality, and you can control what plays and what doesn’t. The ads get annoying after a while, but Pandora gives you a free uninterrupted hour every so often. Great free app.
I love this app 🤗
The only music app I use, get a great mix on my thumb station.
I grew up in the 60s and 70s listen to AM stations on transistor radios. How on earth can I not be amazed by this app??
Pandora always gets it right and their thumbprint radio is to die for.
Pandora good to have. But I'm glad it's free.
Pandora is my go to for radio music. Regular radio is nothing but penis enlargement an erectile disfunction crap along with endless commercials which equals about 5 min of music and 12 min of bs!! No thanks
Each channel a user creates repeats the same 10-15 songs over and over.  Once and every couple months they’ll throw a new song into the mix.
I love ❤️ pandora other than amount of skips and commercials. Don't know why I should pay 💰 to get basic listening privileges
First time to use Pandora was on a recent trip. My husband & I really enjoy listening to out kind of music! No static no tuning just great music! Ordered a Bluetooth speaker to really have great sound! When a call or text no problem auto pause comes on!
This is great app
I listen to Pandora One daily whether it's out riding the lawn mower, cleaning the house, traveling, playing cards or just relaxing, Pandora is on. It's so easy to listen to my favorite artists without having listen to commercials or DJ's.  I love being able to have such a wonderful library of artists to choose from for such a small price I pay. Pandora One and I are partners forever !!!  Thank you, keep up the Great work you guys are doing. Dave Buell  01/05/18 Still very much enjoying Pandora Radio. Experiencing quite a bit of buffering and changing songs in the middle of one🤔 Other then that, loving the music 🎼 
Pandora premium isn’t free.
I cannot delete variety that I’ve added to a playlist
Pandora is the best!!! Love everything about it!!!
😫😞☹️
Whatever the mood, there’s music for it
Great
Excelente
Got tired of them asking for a review so gave them one star so you wouldn’t bother me anymore. Do not like it at all that I created a station called “Far Away Eyes” (from the Rolling Stones “Some Girls “ album) and have probably listened long enough to give a thumbs down to close to one hundred songs because I’ve yet to hear the one I requested.
I love using Pandora whenever music is needed or requested. I initially got it to put my PreKindergarten students to sleep with the Lullaby station. Now, I listen to Pandora at home, on the road or whenever The mood strikes!
Love all the choices and pairs with my echo!
It’s like Pandora knows me
I absolutely love pandora but I don’t like that you don’t have unlimited skips
You guys get it keep it up 👍 I was a young flower child. You should see my album collection 👍 I bet you never listen to Richard P. Havens!
#DoubleSalutePandora KEEP GOOD MUSIC ALIVE...
I hate it!  Going to be looking for alternative
Awesome
Awesome radio stations. Great app for road trips.
I can tell the issue of having to close and reopen isn't new, but I've just had something happen to me that I haven't seen before. I skipped a song and the next song... was the same song. I was then out of skips, very frustrating. Needs many bug fixes. Note: I'm using a brand new iPhone 7+. Update: Immediately after going back to the app, a song I skipped three songs prior came on again. That's two repeats within ten minutes. More issues are coming up lately and we need bug fixes. To further explain, the song order went as follows: Timewarp, FrainBreeze, Top of the World 2, Top of the World 2, Timewarp. 
I have a 2016 Acura TLX and for some reason my radio doesn’t not recognize my Pandora app it says no activation. I have an iphone 7 plus and a Google pixel 2XL and it doesn’t work for both of those devices and I pay for the premium  subscription. On my iPhone 7 I can’t even use Pandora because it automatically blocks me from using Pandora app when is connected to my Bluetooth on my car. So it’s pointless for me to pay for service that doesn’t work.
Nice all around
I can’t just hit play and pause anymore. I have to kill the app to stop music or turn it down and miss the songs that are playing. Very frustrating. Wish it would get fixed!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for the trouble you are experiencing - this is something we are actively working to resolve.

Todo bien
Diversity in music is great. However with the free app every two songs has two commercials. I’ve had a pandora account for several years and it’s just within this past year that the commercials are getting excessive. I am soon deleting my account and the app if this amount of commercials persist.
Ever since I updated pandora I can’t listen to it in my car through a usb.

Fun to listen with pandora on the Bluetooth .

Music is my stress release, and pandora is my music.
I can hear what I want when I want it. I love Pandora!!
I'll pay $5 to stream just because I'm not tech savvy anymore and my computer won't download anything anymore it's old and slow but yeah the music is various and I like to hear new things every once in a while. Stations are great.

I enjoy pandora every day. My favorites are the yoga stations.
Gives me more choices and plays all the songs that I like.👌😋 and keeps me singing happily. THANKS PANDORA. Your 👏 awesome❤️👍🏻 
People need music to sleep, turn on alarm apparently shut off music while sleeping... Counter intuitive I think.
Great app but why did they get rid of bookmarks in the app? All they have now is likes.
This app is complete trash. I get you want people to subscribe but playing ads after every song is overkill. Not to mention changing stations basically crashes the app every time. Definitely not the way to encourage people to use your product.
ASKING FOR A REVIEW EVERY 5 seconds with get you a BAD REVIEW! Your adds are stupid. This is ALL STUPID.
Too many interruptions other than that I love it
This app so stupid
It’s too many of them mfkas
4 or 5 times today my Pandora app has opened on its own and started playing music. I’ve tried closing the app and it will turn off for a while but then it will restart later. When I open the app it won’t let me pause the music. It also does this when I’m on the phone! I’ll be talking to someone and hear the music in the background but the other person can’t hear it. Extremely annoyed and hope it gets fixed!
Must have App!!!
Lots of good songs radio only, randomly changes songs or won’t let me pick randomly and plays what it wants. Pandora Plus, probably worth it but has issues
I had some issues with Pandora initially. But, after a little bit of working with it and choosing the songs that I like it wasn't so bad and come to find out I party to that stuff when I party at my garage
I am now back to using Pandora after having other apps. It's a lovely application.
Pandora is my go to at work, taking care of teens can be stressful, but with the right music their attitudes can change and make the day anazing.
I use Pandora daily during my workouts! I absolutely love it!
Love it!
Loving Air radio! Thank you.
i canceled right away and was still charged for it...!  not what i wanted...! 
I actually stopped downloading music.  The more I listen to pandora and thumbs up my favorites the more they play my favorites!  Great app!!!!
I can listen to any song just for watching a video this is wayyyy better then Spotify thank you!!!!!
Listen on a daily
I would rate a 5 Star but it seems like after every song there is a commercial. I don’t want to have to pay to not have commercials.
I love using pandora but ive noticed that lately it crashes or it takes forever to load on my phone. Idk if it the update or what. Please fix.
Y’all have GOT to figure out how to stop the app from crashing on iOS 11. I don’t want to have to switch to another streaming service.
I pay for the premium pandora and have had nothing but problems. It continuously skips on it own and never lets me play songs on my list it’s been getting worse as it’s always skipping even after I uninstall and reinstall. They need to fix these bugs soon as I’m getting tired of pandora.
Love pandora
You play too many live versions and re-recorded/remixed versions. Stick with the version that made the song great.
It’s play that slap
App freezes and does not play music every time phone goes to sleep. Have to force quit whenever connecting to Bluetooth or resuming play.
Pandora is an amazing app that you can listen to your favorite stations and you can create your own stations!! Love You Pandora!!❤️❤️

Pandora is the bomb. Make sure you sign up for no commercials for full immersion. Trust me, the five bucks or whatever is worth it!
How do I change the current plan?
I love this app. I have for years and will continue for years!

When I was 11 I was going threw a hard time with my parents and I discovered Pandora and I signed up. Pandora is the 1 app I can go to to calm myself down. It's been with me threw my greatest and my worst times. Thank you pandora 
Best music app today!
Enjoying my music 24/7!!
What a beautiful combination of harmoniously synthesized music. Thank you:)
It’s great
I love this app ❤️❤️
Excellent music era recap! The songs played takes you through a time portal, seating you in whatever era you choose.
Update: now the app doesn’t crash but it does not stop playing when I unplug my ear buds and at work that’s annoying. Also if I pause a song and go back to listen to it moments later, it won’t let me continue that song, I have to skip to another song all together. Fix the issues with iOS & Pandora please!  ****** Since Apple released the newest iOS updates on my 7 Plus, Pandora will play for a few mins and then crash and also cause my phone to reboot or crash and ask for my passcode. So frustrating! 
I love pandora I had it for years😍😍
Thank you for making my life a lot more joyful. With Pandora I learn about other artists I never even heard of before so, Pandora teaches and educates their listeners to explore and discover other world music that otherwise one will not get the chance to listen to. Thank you again and happy new year 2018!!!!
I love pandora it’s the best when it has glitches I ignore them because it’s still working and it’s really good for me because I skip songs that I don’t like and it’s great to put skipping at any time and I use this to concentrate and sleep and it’s the best😊😊😊😊
Pandora has always been my go to but lately whenever I get a notification my music pauses and I have to press play in order for the music to play again, which is very inconvenient.
I like the fact you can take Pandora on the go for business event home parties private settings etc......
Very frustrating to start up. Too many ads. Trying Spotify but I don’t know if it’s any better
When you pay $10 you lose the button or at least I can’t find it
Great job Pandora,.,, I've been listening since the beginning.
It so great pandora plus I recommend to you
With pandora premium, dozens of songs so far will consistently and inexplicably refuse to play - if there are licensing issues then the app should inform the user, otherwise I expect any song I choose to play on demand. One example I have never gotten to play is Lil Wayne - Rich As F***
I upgraded the station and its confusing to use.  I\'d like to return to my old station ways and avoid extra payment .

Pandora is Awesome place for listen my favorite music!! I love it!!
I would give it five stars but I think that there is to many advertisements and you should offer it without WiFi so I can listen to it in the car during long car rides. Otherwise the app is great. Thanks
A Ok app
Playing all day, everyday
Love the product, if I ever get ten bucks I will upgrade
Esta muy buena la app se las recomiendo
I love this app! Being able to hear any genre and scope down to a specific type of song and related songs play is wonderful. Pandora allows you to control the songs to go with your mood/activity. GENIUS!!!! Thank you!
Why cant I get it to work in Canada? Even with wifi!!! Even with subscription! Spotify seems to be working well up here. 
The app keeps crashing every few songs. Absolutely annoying because I love it and have used it since 2012. 😦
Works better since December. Occasionally, however, when I look at my lock screen to see what song I’m listening to, it just says Pandora. I have to literally unlock my phone just to see what I’m listening to.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble.

I can create perfection with your help
Please don’t have a party with out Pandora.
This app is a mess. Honestly don’t even like pandora anymore 💫✨
I give 5 Star to Pandora Music because it is The perfect choice for Anyone on the Road, Parties, Home, for its NEVER interruption or breaks on Your music choices
The free version doesn’t have many commercials at all (fewer than radio)... very intuitive when building stations... easy to use... not a bad thing to say, that couldn’t be fixed by getting the paid version I’m sure
To many commercials
I love the variety and I can listen to new music and old favorites!
Great music from the past, brings emotions and memories to present!
I love the variety of music available as well as the ability to tailor the music to my taste. The only thing i wish I could do is repeat a song.
Bluetooth often doesn’t pause when disconnected. I often have to hit skip rather than play to get app to respond once connected to Bluetooth. App is not updated for iPhone X although it’s been out since October. I may switch to Spotify if they can’t get this app fixed and updated
My review would be better with a little assistance with, “does pandora keep an maintain in audio file the recordings, or is it just the title data...
Any time I use my AirPods I have nothing but trouble! Pandora refuses to play my music or once it’s playing it refuses to stop. I have to close the app and restart it constantly to fix the above issues!
I’ve been a Pandora subscriber for nearly 10 Years.  Recently my favorite station, “Metallica” keeps crashing after a handful of songs. I reinstalled the station but it keeps doing it. Super frustrating.  What’s worse, I can’t seem to find a customer support link anywhere in the app to make them aware.  Argh!!!!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing!

Great artists, songs. I really enjoy the music. I just wish it didn't have a lot of commercials. Overall, good music.
Helps me get through day to day living with awesome music.
I had the 3.99 version for years and was super happy.  Then in Dec 2017 they charged me for 12.99 and I contacted support and they refused to credit me the difference and told me to contact my credit card company and dispute the charge.  So off I go to contact the credit card company to fix their billing mistake.  This will probably take months to resolvd.  I am not happy!!   I had to cancel all of my pandora.  Guess I go find an new provider.
Me gusta mucho porque pasan puras rolas perronas
Garbage app...crackling noise???  This is supposed to be a “MUSIC” app...sounds worse than AM radio...UNSUBSCRIBE AND UNINSTALL!!!
My favorite 😊🎼
Best station ever!!
I just don’t like the commercials
I’m definitely enjoying this more than the regular pandora. No commercials and u can pick the song you wanna listen too! So much better and way faster at loading the music!!
Pandora knows what beats and lyrics my Soul is feeling on any given day and time..scary dope! Love this app!
I really love pandora! I don’t mind paying the extra fee to listen to it without commercials. There is only one thing that I dislike at this moment. While listening to a song  it’ll stop playing, so I’ll have to go back and start the song again or close and reopen the app. This is minor but still an issue especially when I’m connected to WiFi or in a good spot where I have service. I have been paying for premium quite awhile never had a problem until now. I love pandora music is life but I don’t like my songs being interrupted. I hope it gets better :) please!
Alright so where do I start I have used pandora for a long time now. Around 6 years I have loved and I’m not knocking it. I have even been paying for pandora premium for 2 months now. The thing is when your pandora app crashes and can’t listen to any music it really make you think about not paying that subscription anymore. Just a thought to keep in mind Pandora
Free Pandora has not worked correctly since the last 2 or 3 updates. It freezes (e.g., continues playng on the iphone) when the vehicle is turned off.  It also doesn't display the song title or artist in the car screen. You have to hard kill Pandora to rese it on your phone.  I tried multiple car systems (e.g., VW, Ford, Toyota, Kia) all identical issue. I recently replace my 6s for a X-iPhone with no improvement. I'll appreciate a Pandora tech looking into it. Thank you.
I have had pandora since late in 2009 or early 2010. Pandora is not what it used to be, historically i have given pandora 3-4stars, there are many many nice new features and improvements however the new pandora is pretty bad. I hopefully await the next update. i love your service and would love to pay for a premium membership please understand i cant go through everything here and will update this comment. For starters your music algorithm has only gone down hill with your most recent updates. By this i mean the way pandora delivers music is different and i no longer have a single station that plays what i want to hear and no stations capable of playing my diverse interests. The shuffle feature helped a lot but these days im using all my skips and heading over to youtube or my itunes library because im not happy with whats playing.  Second it is upsetting to be given an option to watch a video to gain more skips then watch a 14second inaudable video that only allows 1skip before locking me in. The add time, the add itself, and the reward are all inappropriate here. Please do not misunderstand there was no problem in the audio feed, the add itself had a speaker that mumble squeeked rather than speaking. I do not ever appreciate this, if your add is a man talking, into a headset of all things, i aught to be able to understand him...please update pandora soon. Also declutter the ui, I understand apples recent thing is to put as many useless extra screens and pre menu screens in and re displays of the same info already displayed as they can...but this really pisses me off and is the #1 reason i will not purchase another apple product. Make things more efficient and definitive. Capitalize on efficiency in your ui and you will be rewarded many times over for it. 
❤️❤️❤️
Title says it all. Plus it crashes all the time.
Pandora is a lot better than utube except for the part that u have to pay for it
Too many ads
I love this app!
There's certain songs where I don't have the option to listen to it again. That's okay but something should be placed where you listen to it for some amount of times, you unlock access to listening to it again or something.
This is an amazing app that plays all my favorite songs but the down fall is that you need to pay or watch a video to skip or replay a song :( but other than that it’s a great way to listen to music fast and many different stations and millions of Songs to be played
THIS APP IS AMAZING 😉 This app blocks bad words. Plays music when the device is off. Knows my favorite. AND MANY MORE! Who is staring at the get button PRESS IT!!!
I absolutely love this app😉😂🤣😜💕
Always crashes, limited skips, commercials every other song. Just get Iheartradio
I work in construction before it was really difficult to find a radio station that plays only music. Since I discover pandora I enjoy more work and time flies!!!
I love pandora but I have one request. When there is an ad for a horror movie, please have the option to skip it because there are people who have anxiety and/or other disabilities that can be triggered by these ads. Thank you.
I subscribed to pandora plus because they claimed it was free of ads and pauses. My music was interrupted several times with ads from artists, additionally, I would have long periods of “pauses”. During these pauses the entire app would freeze rendering it useless. Iam paying for this service and it was not available to me for long periods of time, this was extremely frustrating. Pandora does not offer refunds partial or otherwise although the service they should be providing is not available for long periods of time and their claims of no ads is false. Pandora you are not the only music provider in the digital world. I unsubscribed and will likely use apple music.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’ve experienced!

Really brings back memories,of good times🙏🏻
A great application for those who know and appreciate good music.  Keep up the good work, Pandora!!
When Pandora starts it gives you the option to pay extra. While my thumb is moving to the “no” choice the app moves the pay extra button to where the “no” button was. Good thing I don’t allow in app purchases or I would have bought the pay version a dozen times.
Most thing I love about it is Elvis Presley Radio. Although they put the Beatles on there. (I think they took Elvis's popularity). Even though Apple makes you pay money to download Elvis Presley songs! With Pandora, it's better than Apple music.
Lots of stations to choose and set as your favorite! Love how it lets me skip the ads most of the time. The ads aren’t too long until the stations come back to listen to your favorite songs!! A must have on every device!
Love my music
Since inception, it has been my favorite means to listen to music.  If only videos were played while song played, that would be something!  - Enanoverde 
Pandora watch app plays through your phone if you’re away from it (even with cell service on watch). People were jamming to my pandora in the gym locker room while I worked out with no tunes playing through my connected Bluetooth earbuds :( I also had to kill the app on my phone to get it to stop playing through my phone!
The other day I was at work and I was in a  hurry and I accidentally upgraded to premium and now I can’t unsubscribe and it’s really making me mad . I looked for help and it wasn’t helpful at all . It just annoying and irritating  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble!

I love using it on my Alexa (Echo).
Awesome!
I️ enjoy listening to Pandora all the time
I enjoy pandora every day make the day so much easier.
The greatest
I use to use pandora for all my music, but haven’t used it in a couple months because of a few problems. First of all, I can listen to two or three songs by an artist, but then it goes to random songs and artists. I get really annoyed when I want to listen to one artist, and then it goes to another. I would also get annoyed with the limited skips. When I ran out of skips I had to wait a long time to get more, which I didn’t like. I recommend getting a music app called Spotify, which I like a lot better. It meets all my needs without getting the premium. With pandora, I would think getting the premium would help with these problems, but if you want to save time you can get Spotify.
Was unable to download or listen to this soundtrack, one if my all time favorites !!
Do not the adds before song
Pandora keeps the tracks new from my favorite artists and almost never repeats the same song. I always find new music of the same variety that I can show off toy friends.
Easy to select favorite tunes!
I enjoy Pandora every single day. I live overseas and it is one little thing that makes life better for me. It’s easy to use... one little downfall.. after a while of using the same channel it stops adding new song options. Then I have to listen to the same stuff. So I end up creating a new channel to get something different to listen to. But I really do enjoy and appreciate Pandora.
Cancelled my premium subscription after nearly a year. Horrible, constant pausing. Commercials popping up out of nowhere. Still getting blocked when skipping songs. It seems you people enjoyed catching my fleeing cash but not delivering on your end of the bargain.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’ve experienced!

Way too many in a row
I love pandora 😋❤️
The fact that they dont have an update for the iphone x shows that theyre kind of giving up. The phone has been out for over 3 months. Switching to spotify i guess 🙄
You can hear everything here 😍🤫
Pandora is AMAZING!!! If I had the chance to I would give it 10 stars. I hope you buy it - cuz whoever made this is a true genius and I would like to shake their hand. Good security and amazing music options!! Definitely get it or you’re missing out on something everyone needs.  Only one problem- you need WiFi for it and when you’re in the car it doesn’t work. But all in all I wanna give this ten stars but I can’t. 😭 It’s too good! 
This app is great! I love it so much but the stations seem to repeat the same songs over and over again and it would improve my listening experience if you could add more songs and try not to repeat as much...also if you could make Pandora compatible with the iPhone X it would be amazing!!
We love pandora! Nora & Nana sing & Dance ! Everyday !
Nice app"
The play button won’t work. I tried to listen to music and connect to my cars bluetooth. The app showed the song was playing but no sound came from my phone or my car for about 15 seconds. Then the phone said pause and it wouldn’t play after pressing play. Changing  radio stations does nothing went it used to work sometimes. Please fix pandora! This gets annoying and makes me closer and closer to changing my music source app.  Thank you 
I refuse to use this app until iPhone X support is added.
Mi radio favorita mi respeto los creadores
They have such good choices of music on here! I love this app!
Good for finding new music. However, when you make a station for a particular band, in my experience after a few songs it just stops bringing in songs by them and slowly deviates from that band unless you give a bunch of thumbs down or quit the app and play that station again. Can get a little annoying if you’re trying to look find music for a specific band. You’re better off just listening to their stuff directly off YouTube or something. Other than that Pandora is really good at showing bands or songs related to what you already like and has helped me discover many artists that I still enjoy today
you can listen to so many amazing songs FOR FREE. but the only other issue is the ads that happen almost every time a new song will play but otherwise ITS GREAT. i would definitely recommend it
It’s long over due come on. Get Iphone X capability
There are great music choices for all occasions and moods! Enjoy Pandora so much!
👍🏼👍🏼
Thank you APP Gods.  However, work on the licensing issues.  I hit buy because the determining factor for me was "repeat option".  I noticed that on some/most Salsa Genre I cannot repeat.  :( ❤️ 
This is the best music app I’ve ever used. The price for pandora premium is well worth it.
I listen to Pandora everyday. In the kitchen, in the car, at the gym
Love it
App crashes my whole phone all the time
The best
To many commercials
Excelente servicio, me encanta!
Pretty good music app. Very user friendly and straight forward. The app also has a good premium option but you can of course just watch adds to get some premium options if you don’t want to pay. Overall I’d recommend.
Love it so coot
Could you guys make it so it’s full screen for iPhone X users. The short squatty box I look at is no bueno! Show us some love! Thank you
Why hasn’t there been an update yet for iPhone X? The screen is still super small and looks outdated. Only app that hasn’t done it I noticed.
very good music app just hate that you have to buy premium to listen to what you want
I primarily use this app to play music for kids and have noticed that video ads for horror movies have a tendency to pop up. Not sure if the ads are randomly generated or if they’re related to the station but 15 second clips for ‘Insidious’ aren’t really appropriate when listening to Sesame Street.
I pay for service on Apple and Spotify, and the radio algorithm has always been better on Pandora. The problem was there was no way to access music directly. That has been fixed with Premium. It is now the best streaming music app.
Wish it had more variety
Pandora sets my moods. Whether it’s my morning workout or my Spiritual hour. I LOVE PANDORA!!!!!! 
Great!!!!
I\'m a premium user who is clearly unhappy like a lot of other people.  It will play a song for only 30 or so seconds before skipping it.  It\'s been doing this for about a month now.  At first I thought it was just my phone even though every other app on my phone was working properly but after talking to some friends about it I realized they ALL had the same issue.  Even after updating the app it continued to completely annoy me by not finishing any of the songs.  DON\'T PAY FOR THIS APP!!! Pandora has lost a customer and I will be switching to Spotify or Apple Music.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing!

Pero me gustaría que pongan menos comerciales
App play controls don’t function with latest update. Fails to play if another app is playing Instead if taking over as primary audio app. Also fails to pause or stop once it does finally start playing. Never had these issues before so think it’s something they did for new iOS or iPhone X, that’s incompatible with older iPhones. Please fix Pandora, stopping use until next update.
Crashes. And when it does, my entire phone (OS 11.1.2)  More commercials than ever before.  Aren't there already enough visual ads? Why do I need to hear a commercial every 2-3 songs?  The volume also suddenly drops when a text or email is delivered. Not sure if this is an Apple or Pandora thing. The only way I can fix is to unplug my headphones and replay them in, then press play again. 
Thathy thenp
I used to love Pandora. I was also an early subscriber. What I really enjoyed was it presented me with music tailored to my taste. Many times, I don’t have a specific song I want to listen to and just want Pandora to surprise me. Unfortunately, i hear the same songs over and over now even if I setup a new channel. And lately, every time I open the app, I get prompted to upgrade to premium. STOP IT!!! It’s annoying. I said no the first time. I subscribed because I don’t want ads. And they make the “no thanks” link so small, that I mistakenly press the wrong link to upgrade which I don’t want. Please stop this!!! I’m on the verge to just not use Pandora any more and look elsewhere. It’s so annoying that it made me write this review and I never write reviews. So please, with freaking sugar on top, stop freaking prompting me and just let me get to my music.
Pandora really helps me, especially during a workout due to the thump up and thump down choices it really reflects on my mood.
This app automatically signed my up for pandora premium without allowed me the “no thanks” option and now I’m jumping through hoops to discontinue service. 🤬Fuq Ima pay 12$ a month for something that’s free.

I use this app every day.👍👍👍 recommended....one of my favorite apps. Easy to use. Good variety............. 😳😳😳 they got rid of the bookmarks - so now you can bookmark a song but have no place to look them up🤪🤪🤪well ok
I just wrote this so it would stop asking me be it is a good app I love it
It’s aghit
I like the direction Pandora is going but they don’t offer the ability to crossfade songs and the app isn’t even updated to take advantage of the iPhone X. Will update once these things are fixed.
Hey I’m going back home now and then I’ll come get you tomorrow morning and then go get my dad to come over for dinner tonight
I love pandora, a lot, but I wish it didn’t ask me for stuff and interrupt me while I’m trying to change or “like” songs with its unnecessary pop-ups of things I said no to hundreds of times. Anyway , I pay for the first version : Pandora One , so I don’t have to listen to commercials . So it’s just annoying to deal with that. Thanks for being awesome otherwise!
Love it🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Awesome
Thank god for ads. Dunno what I would do with that $15 a month without them....
A reliable source of musical education! ✨🤙✨ 
Would give 5 stars if I was able to shuffle my stations.
I love pandora.
It’s the most chill and positive app. I get exactly what I want and how I want it.
I love the fact that I have control over the types of music I want to listen to but I wish that my playlists would be with the list radio stations. Other than that I love the basic concept of the Pandora app!!
Been bumpin Pandora since day 1 🔥

Awesome but needs to work without internet
I absolutely love this app..... plays music for and my children to enjoy at different times and for different events.
This app is amazing it’s way better that YouTube because I can turn off my phone or text and all others and it still plays
This app is amazing, I get all the music I want to listen to all in one place and I can exit the app and have it still playing! I can even turn off my phone unlike YouTube... the only thing is that without pandora plus I can’t have unlimited skips and replays and I also can’t search...
Excelente! 👏👏🎶🎼🎶🎼🎵 Mejor que otras!!!! Pandora número uno! 👏🏻👍🏻
Awesome music put a Sadie baby channel on
Love Pandora..... perfect for background music
I love how you can change your songs without it having to listen to the same one over and over again if you don’t want to
I love this App
I like the new update is easy to navigate and easy to like music
Extremely difficult if not impossible to do anything except upgrade from device. No other changes available. Poor taste Pandora. Perhaps after $12.99 a month without notice of a $10/month price jump you guys will be able to afford app developers that can trouble shoot so people don’t have to write horrible reviews. Very disappointed.
Pandora seems to have too many streaming issues since new operating system was released. Doesn’t automatically connect with car unless I close and reopen the ap. Turns on without me pushing play. Have to close and restart app whenever listening with headphones. Still don’t understand offline mode...please fix otherwise I’ll cancel my Pandora one subscription.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I can’t get it to play at all. I like this app but it won’t connect to my car2015. It will not play some days. I was going to sign up and pay but nothing works.
It really gets u going
Been a satisfied listener for 6+ years! Love the free hour of ad free listening!
Spotify can do waaaaaayyyyyyy more than Pandora, as well as doing everything that Pandora can do. There's also less ads on Spotify, so..... why are you even considering getting Pandora?
Great way to spend leisure time relaxing.
I already pay for plus, please get rid of the annoying prompts to upgrade....you’re already getting money from me. I could see if I was using the free version but come on...
Allot of songs from artists’ made stations just repeat, a number of the same songs. Get more songs NEW and old from that particular artist to play, even if you have to add more commercials on the free version. Get more up to date albums from artists.
I love this app you can leave your phone anywhere and play the music as long as you like. Plus you can turn your phone off and it will still play on which is good because my phone shuts off frequently plus it goes on blue-tooth for headphones 🎧 which can be awesome 👏!!!!
The songs I love and quick commercials.
I give this five stars, I love it!💕
I enjoy this app everyday I love thumbprint station with my favorite music
Listening to Pandora is like having your friend being the DeJay, playing all your jams back to back!
Always has the greatest Hits.
Ur mom
I have had some many times the pause/play button will not respond. This has happened both trying to pause music and playing. Also it continues to play after disconnecting from Bluetooth devices. It will just automatically transfer to the phone speakers. I have also had the app randomly open and start playing while the phone is locked. I have been have these issues for over a month now.
I find your playlist to be very limited. For instance Bob Dylan has a vast catalog of music but I only here about the same 10 or 15 songs over and over.
Excelente ... me encanta😍
I like diversity and quality of music. They go hand in hand. I seem to find just what I’m looking for when I need it. Awesome
I Love this station
To many commercials
I've been fine tuning my stations for years and I love how Pandora chooses new songs I might like based on my selections. I love this app and I will use it forever. Months later... Still love Pandora. Thinking about upgrading in appreciation of all the free music I’ve been hearing over the years but I don’t mind the ads at all. Quick and they’re done. Love this app. 
Plays great songs, u dig.
I truly enjoy listening to Pandora! I have a wonderful list of artist that I listen to and they are my personal picks! Great App❤️
I love Pandora music. The music gets me through work, workouts, and tuning out the loud kiddos.
Absolutely perfect, besides the fact I can’t listen without WiFi when needed... But I understand that’s how Pandora makes money by charging people for Pandora Plus for offline listening 🙄👌
You will Not he disappointed with Pandora.
Too many ads , just cut outs for no reason and keeps asking me to join premium.
Pandora is the best⚡️ song 🎼🎧app l love it ❤️❤️❤️ I️ rate it 5 stars ✨
Cool
I subscribed to pandora premium last week. They say ad free listening. Nope still get ads after every song. They say unlimited skips. Nope i can skip maybe 2 songs and I can't skip anymore. Would not recommend to anyone!!
Pandora wakes me in the morning, keeps me company while cooking and best part.... my kiddos & I dance around to toddler music 😁
I love it , absolutely love it
You always have to watch ads if you want more skips and they never give you enough. Something that I like is there is always 100% clean music here. I wish I could combine multiple artists for a radio though.
Obviously, I just hate the commercials.
Y’all give me the the music I need when I need it
While pandora is great, this app has several buggy issues that happen often. When using the Bluetooth audio, once you turn of the connected device, the audio speakers on the phone continues playing pandora. This wouldn’t be an issue except the pause play button no longer functions. So the only options to stop the continued stream of data is either to switch to offline mode where there is 50-50 chance that it will stop or continue. The only other way I’ve been able to stop the app is to completely shutdown the phone and restart.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble.

It’s fire and lif it’s flit
I payed for premium and it said I was going to get the 1 month free trial and I did not. I did not pay 13 dollars so that they could take my money. It said unlimited skips and I have to watch an ad for more skips. It also said I get to play any song I want they did not tell me that I had to watch an ad just to hear the song I want.
Motivational to write or workout, drive, worship, reminisce, or relax. All tailored to personal preferences.  LOVE my Pandora❤️
Good to be able to listen songs from past n present.. I’m tuning in...
The music is clear you can here it you can listen to whatever you want you can randomize it is just amazing music with pandora
Good but how do I cancel a subscription?
The algorithm that generates a station is fantastic! Very quickly adjusts to what you want to hear.
Great selection!
I wish you could listen to artist stations that JUST had that artist.
Pandora would be such a good app. Now I can’t even listen to music with out having to close it first after opening it just so it can start playing songs. What’s up with that?
Not being able to sort and list my stations alphabetically on premium is god awful torture. I cannot browse my own collection of stations not knowing or remembering what I have if they’re all cluttered on a list and in this carousel thing is also annoying. Premium is just the same as plus just cluttered and sort of a mess. Worse part is I cannot switch back to plus even when I go to my subscriptions and try to fix it i can’t I’m stuck.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：If you need help switching back over to Pandora Plus, send a message to our support team and they can assist: http://pdora.co/AppReview 
Estoy muy contento y me gusta mucho Pandora pues la tengo por varios años en mi apps solo falta un poco más de beis para que se oiga perfecto un poquito más de beis
Una app excelentísima
Please stop the ads
Music is life
I have had pandora since the very beginning and have loved it - it’s now crashing all the time on my iPhone X   Please fix it and I will change my rating  Sincerely, frustrated 
I’ve been listening to Pandora for over 10 years now. For over 4 years, I’ve been paying for Pandora Plus and still am.  As a former manager of what was one of the largest independent record stores in the nation, I have a breadth of knowledge and experience to draw from in writing a review of a “music” service.  I say “inferior” because there is at least one far superior option out there for streaming music. I think that is not debatable but now simply statistically true. For Pandora, sadly, this should probably come as no surprise.  I say “careless” because after over a year since the last time I dared contact Pandora in hopes that they might do anything about their many technical issues, it is obvious that they’re not concerned with quality nor with listener/subscriber experience.  I say “inept” because, at this point, it seems that they aren’t able to provide a better quality experience or an app that works as one might expect it should.  The music: Regardless of how broadly and variedly you might be able to “seed” your station/stations on Pandora’s platform, expect that your efforts will only return a narrow and repetitive selection of songs. The selection is just barely better than you’ll encounter listening to actual radio. Further, you’ll have to wonder if their “Music Genome Project” (a fantastic and impressive idea that seems to have fallen far short of its potential) seems as though it most probably runs on algorithms that were specifically designed to favor relatively few, select artists. I’ve listened often enough and long enough to sincerely wonder whether they’re actually being paid by some entity that is connected to the artists they seem to blatantly favor. However, I must allow for the possibility that their algorithm is designed to favor favorites. If so, we’re at least clear on why the selection of plays is so narrow and we’re assured that it will remain so and grow increasingly more so with time.  The app: Over a year ago, I encountered the inability to listen to a station that I had created 9 years prior. I had been listening to that station off and on across those many years. I contacted technical support because I do pay for the service and because I was fond of the work I’d put into creating and curating the station over many years. Unfortunately, while their agents were friendly, they seemed to be anything but knowledgeable and were ultimately unable to find any solution to my problem. My workaround was to finally just recreate another station with the same seeds and start over. Some weeks later, that old station magically started working again (I kept checking out of curiosity). During that experience, it was actually suggested to me by one of their support personnel that I had “too many seeds” in that station and that that many seeds would do nothing to broaden, vary, or enhance my station but would instead simply confuse things—this coming from a service that continuously prides itself on its interactive functionality and encourages users to be more interactive.  As of late, while listening to any given one of my Pandora stations, songs will start rapidly skipping—breezing through just a few seconds each of the beginning of numerous songs in a row. I’ve admittedly neglected to even contact technical support about this issue because I unfortunately have no faith in their own ability to fix their sadly broken app. My device is current and the OS is up-to-date. I’ve reset my device. I’ve deleted and reinstalled the app—all to no avail—just as with the previous issues I’ve experienced. This is now all that I expect of Pandora.  I continue to pay for and listen to Pandora Plus as a varied option to a superior streaming service. I even tried to upgrade to Pandora Premium when it first became available (I spend money on music and I check out everything I can—satisfied or otherwise.) WHILE the Premium option was being advertised within the app and within my signed in account, when I tried to upgrade, it actually returned an error stating that it was not yet available in my area. How many businesses would take pride in advertising an option to those who couldn’t actually even buy the option if they wanted to? The answer is: Pandora—the unashamed service that continues to roll downhill.  On a good note, I do, albeit increasingly rarely, encounter music on Pandora that is new to me and that I might not have encountered elsewhere.  Pandora was once a very exciting and enjoyable option for streaming music. I do hope that it might somehow redeem itself. I’m paying and I’m still listening... but I’m certainly not holding my breath.  Keep this in mind: while Pandora doesn’t “play music to an empty room” or “when nobody’s listening”, there are streaming music options out there that are willing to saturate and satiate your musical appetite... find them, relax, and enjoy! 
I LOVE pandora but I can’t get it agin because it is not for the update that I just got on my phone  Sad face  Please update your soft wear thz bue 
Best app
Absolutely LOVE Pandora!! The stations I choose play all of my favorite songs all of the time!!
cant wait
I listen to Pandora all day everyday. They play all the songs I love. Pandora is my favorite!!!!!
Fix the pause button issue! Update doesn’t work. Every time you listen to Pandora in your car the music continues to play after you leave your car on your phone. Really annoying.

Pandora is amazing but I would love if we could listen to songs from all around. For example , if I lived in the US and I wanted music from the UK I would love if that was possible to listen to songs from all around the world.
Can’t control my pioneer radio or my phone when connected though Bluetooth🤬
When Pandora is working, it is great.  Sometimes though, it just stops.  Other times I can’t get it started.  I can use the Bluetooth connection to my speaker for other apps, so I don’t think it is a problem on my end.  If it didn’t have this problem, I would consider the paid version, although I don’t yet know how much it costs.
I love the variety of artists and genres Pandora offer. The limited advertisement interruptions is a bonus.
I would like to rewind and fast forward songs
Pandora makes it easy to enjoy fav music at my fingertips!
When will Pandora update the app to stream over LTE on Watch 3 without iPhone?
I can pick the music I like and skip what I don’t!
Best ever! Plays through my car speakers with pictures of the artists or album. Lyrics and Bios for all!  Have it on my computer with great speakers and is a playlist on Echo that you can ask Alexa!  I happily give it a Bazillion A’s!😊  Catherine 
Take them off
Pandora is good except some songs I want to replay. Jewel
I listen to all genres all types of music Pandora is the most thorough of any other station on this planet. The programming is incredible, I can’t get the words off my brain to describe the genius on how they pulled this off.
To be able to categorise music , comedy, rap, classic rock etc.
Pandora...what can I say? Beautiful! They play your very favorite songs and always are true to their ads.
Best game in the entire gosh darn universe
Constantly loses control of music being played through Chromecast Audio devices (can’t stop playback, skip tracks, etc.).  After losing it’s connection to the Chromecast Audio, Pandora annoyingly starts playing different music through my phone speaker while the Chromecast Audio continues out of control.  As a paying customer, I certainly expect much better Chromecast Audio integration. 
Pandora has music from artists who haven’t been heard in centuries and decades.  Where else can you find that?
Great fun!  Thanks!
I like a lot of music apps pandora is the first one I used
Great app, one of my favorites!!
The reason why I don’t join Pandora is I joined years ago and when I wanted to quit, Pandora made it nearly impossible to stop their service. I had to call my bank to stop the charge that they were taking out every month. Pandora is run by thieves and I refuse to give them money. I don’t listen to their advertising spots either.
So grateful that I can just have some time to myself listening to some amazing music
This is the best app that has music on it you can add different artists, bands, everything and if you don’t like the song it supplies you with skips to skip the song.Great app I definitely recommend it.
Love how my stations stay current with what I’m listening to
Best app ever
Play songs from what radio we choose our artists plz
Good app...could be great with more skips
Have used Pandora for years but starting to investigate alternatives. The app crashes my phone almost every time I use for 30 minutes or longer.
My best companion all the time 🎼🎻🎹😁
Great station
Unless you wanna give them money there are so many restrictions and a lot of these songs I have never even heard of. In my opinion it’s still a good app and that is the only down side.
Nice job!!!
Randomly stops playing a lot lately  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing. Please feel free to reach out to our support team directly for assistance: http://pdora.co/AppReview 
All my favorite songs in one app! Makes it easier to vacuum my room
Listen to everyday and every night but the app keep disconnecting my stations and closing the app fix please
I enjoy pandora
It’s absolutely the Greatest, love that I can hear songs from my youth!!!!  Makes me feel young again
Some exclusive features you would have to pay for is like whatever Song you want at one time but the perks are that you don’t have to pay for your music and also it’s just a very good app and you can stream to like top hits or something like that
So awesome it knows what I’m looking for
‭
Its great
Martinez
I love pandora ‼️❤️😭😭😭😭
Pandora makes for a happy day!
Y’all should make an option to remove artists from stations. Every station I’ve gone to keeps playing g eazy.
Is awful!!! I wish I never updated. App is unusable now. Wiped out all my stations. Keeps shutting down. Horrible.
I really love pandora and I think that I should be able to make my own playlist ❤️❤️
Great!
This app has introduced me to more wonderful music than I could ever have found on my own.
Love pandora. Daily.
This is the best but all I want no commercial
It keeps making my phone turn off and I know it is Pandora because it doesn’t turn off unless I’m listening to Pandora.

Great sounds
Love Pandora!! Can't go a day without listening at home or work !
I’ve been a pandora user from the start. I’m already paying for what was originally premium for pandora. It was supposed to be no commercials and continuous music streaming. Now I have promotions for the premium and ads from the artists. Recently with the last few updates, I have been finding myself skipping more and more of their ‘like’ songs. I’ve heard good things about Spotify and thinking I’m gonna Make the switch
Great app, only problem is that it sometimes stops playing on it’s own and you can’t add certain styles of songs or artists to a station like you can on a pc
Very good the goat
Great App!
Simply exceptional in every way
It has more than enough songs BUT, there are some ads that interrupt the song. But other than that Pandora is really cool and amazing if you are in the mood to listen to songs and maybe(if you do this you CRAZY!!!!!) you could sing the lyrics really loud!!!!!!!!!
I'm having this problem with a keenwood DNX892 excelon. Now my problem is I usually have to plug in my phone then close out of Pandora and swipe it up basically resetting the app and then plug it back in in order for it to actually get picked up for the radio. I noticed this a few months ago and thought it was just a bug that would get patched but nothing as of the first of 2018.
Loving it in 2018
We love all the Irish music Pandora has !!
❤️....🎶🎵🎶
When it works, the service is my favorite, but the new app is bad. I always thought the last version was solid.  I often can't get chromecast to respond to my touch.  Honestly, new app is pushing me back to other services.
Great app, needs a sorting tool to go to selection instead of scrolling.
Pandora lets you listen to stations you like,different interesting songs, and pandora premium!! I love it!😍
Whatever I happen to be in the mood for is available. Love it.
It’s got anything you want in music style and you can set up your favorites easily
Please update the app to fit the iPhone X screen
Can’t live without it. And I learn about new artist too. Then buy on iTunes.
It’s great if wasn’t for seaching for signal all the time
Have the classics Rock tunes for my morning workout, every tune bone crusher oldies from 70’s-80’s, push through the pain!!
Has all my favorite music
I love music in revelation songs , but I wish some music would not cut off. I like bundle preferred music overalls. I love to listen where it takes me times to play po regular pandora.
I don’t like people complain about there being commercials and blah blah blah but it is a free music app that lets you pick thousands of different styles of music to listen to whatever you want. I don’t like commercials, pay for the upgrade. If you just listen to multiple types of music, welcome!
I love it more and more each day!!!!
Don’t @ me
Too much Commercials
AAA can’t say enough.
Excelente i love to listen pandora
I really don’t like the pandora ios delete
It’s amazing ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Great music,keep up the good work.
The app should be iPhone X compatible please
Now I love pandora, it has an amazing concept. I mean free music with a couple of adds but its alright. But the problemo is the type of music stile you pick should be the only music you listen to, the other day it was playin a weird rock/ heavy metal and I chose rap and hip hop. And this is optional but people like Shaw Memdes and JB should be labeled “I want WOMEN hip hop” and X and people like him should be labeled “sad rap/ metaly”- ps please don’t be like lil inestine and trying to “ beg to differ” and thank y’all for listening to me and this deep “ complain”.
Good job
Muy buena música siempre
Great curated playlist for every artist
Hppy Happy Happy 
AWESOME!!
100%
Always great selection of tunes. I love that it pauses for phone calls and lets me know I received a text message.
Great music
My 7 month old daughter loves this old timer music just like me! Way to go pandora
I love this it's so amazing this app is the only app where I get to listen to all my favorite music  and I'm really great full for it . I appreciate it and the best part is that you can listen to it anytime anywhere and no waiting you just click it and it plays whoever created this app thx so much your amazing 😇🤗
Me encanta! Me fascina Pandora
I have loved Pandora since I first installed the ap. of course I have tried others but always keep coming back home to Pandora! The only thing that would make the free version better would be to queue a song vs an artist selection. 
This is a awesome app but the thing is the ads I WISH THEY CAN LEAVE❤️
Lame music app
Me encanta Pandora por su selección de Música 
It is so good. I would recommend never uninstalling this app
Love, love love the new Pandora premium.  Pick what I want all night long!
Pandora fits all my needs love it so much
I like pandora, but the more you “like” the more it just repeats the same things instead of looking for more things like it. I wish I got more unpredictable songs similar to the ones I “like”
The past three or so months songs will randomly pause and it’s very frustrating. Running the newest updates from pandora and iOS. I feel like it’s only when the advertisements pop up does it pause. The music won’t keep playing until I close the app and start over. Again, this has been continuing over multiple updates and multiple months.
It is the best for when you travel
I love this app because I can have songs when I have my phone off so it will be able to not die when I don’t have a charger and I can play other games while I’m listening to music music which is amazing I love your guises game will app Pandora is the best app I’ve used and I hope everyone gave you five or four stars not three are down I don’t think you guys deserve 32 or a one star I think you guys deserve five or for at least four but I say five I like how you guys can do an interview I likeI like how you can change times and you want to have different thumbs up thumbs down I don’t really like the ad but that’s OK you don’t really have ads and I like how you can just search Music or little search I like how you can change sounds and you want to have different thumbs up thumbs down I don’t really like the ad but that’s OK you don’t really have ads and I like how you can search Music or a little search you know I mean and I really like it I’m glad I can tell you guys this
More commercials than before.
Love the mix
I think this is a awesome app because the music is awesome and fun also cool
Love Pandora Radio! Great way to groove out, no matter the mood. Love you can build your own stations!
I love the South Park movie and
A ok Less commercials more music on the artist station desired.
At 71 I get the opportunity to listen   To the many years of different types of music. Pandora is a joy in my life. Thank you.
I love it so much best music ever! Not a lot of adds too!!!! I’m so happy every time I turn Pandora on!
Dramatic increase in the amount commercials played on regular pandora (not premium) . Super annoying.
Best!!
Awesome music!! Keeps me going!! Thanks!!😘
Pandora is amazing
Didn’t sign up for premium and got charged for it.
No need for satellite radio!! Pandora it’s all you need.
Pandora is a great app to listen to all of your favorite hits, throwbacks to today’s music. Highly recommended!
Sometimes I play my songs and it plays random music that I don’t even like or know
Every time I want to play thumbprint, I always get an message saying this station is currently unavailable, please choose another station. It used to work and ever since I did a update on the app, now I get this message all the time. Very disappointed.
I pay $5/month to be able to play  music UNINTERRUPTED because when I play music on a loud speaker there’s nothing more annoying than a pause to hear ads/ suggestions. This wasn’t happening before the update, not sure why it’s happening now. So deceptive.
I like all the songs that are random and are cool and I also like about pandora Is that it also has all the songs in the world ever made.
Nothing but the best comes from Pandora The station makes me feel young again I love it
I really love it! I wish that it could have a huge update
Question mane you changed the look of the free app.  It is shown correctly in the App Store but my iPad app now just shows name and song and ad or album cover no info on artists or similar artists struggle to find my stations.  Any instructions online.
Pandora is an amazing app because you create the music stations you love.
I like it but I have the same ads 25/7 so having different ads would Be nice 
I buy add free only to continue to get adds.  This is so frustrating.  Perhaps I should shop it.  :(
This app has an ok radio to select the songs u like but I have some issues. This app plays WAY TO MANY RANDOM SONGS I DIDNT WANT AND LOTS OF ADS. PLEASE FIX THIS.... 
Jamming music I grew up on to get thru the day.   Play on! 
GREAT!
Love every minute of it.
I love pandora I can costemize my music channels for my favorite music ❤️ and take it were ever I go
It is good I think that all the songs you like they play more
I love this app so much!
Need to be louder
Always has my favorite music
Pandora rocks. It’s the best app for all kinds of music
Unless you pay for the service. Pandora will not keep your music picks clean. They will throw a lot of trash in your music pick.    Example.   Playing EDM on a Native American flute music channel 
Great music options with little interruptions!
Works horribly now, can’t unlimited skip since premium came out which unlimited was part of my plan, doesnt work in my car, doesn’t stop playing or let me pause/unpause. Disappointed customer, if it isn’t fixed soon then off to a better company.
It’s all you need!
Love pandora been using it for years 👍🏽
Thank you for being

I listen to Pandora daily. This last update made the app crash, not open, and can’t use. Now I’m driving back home for the Holidays and have no Pandora. Great job folks. Way to make the big fixes create new bugs. Don’t download the new update!!!! It’s crap! 5 stars prior to update. 0 stars after the update.
Loving the stations!! Always finding great mixes. But for some reason I can’t find a station that has edited versions of songs!?! Do I need to change my age group? Other than that, Pandora has definitely been upgrading their music! Thanks!!!
I Enjoy pandora. Comes in handy, for car ride, bus ride, plane ride, walk, in the background of a talk, at a party. Like I said, every track for every setting.   -2Timez 12-31-2017 1:43pm 
I love this app it has a great selection of music, but when I want to play the music I love it won’t let me. It will say “station currently not available” every time I want to play it. I have the app but currently I’m using Spotify because I can’t play any music on your app.
Play it hours a day. Better company than tv.
On Pandora's site is it states that in order to turn off auto-play you simple go to advanced setting and turn it off; however, that option is nowhere to be found.  Have already had half a dozen embarrassing moments in public where my music turns on loudly from my phone.  Going onto their support page it advises nothing about this and I'm unable to find where to email for support.

I switched from Spotify because of all the ads and I loved pandora for about a half year because of less ads. now I'm getting more ads than Spotify ever had! I'll finish an ad, then pause a song for 10 seconds, and when the songs over I'll get another ad. It's gotten unbearable. Back to Spotify (plus it's the same price with their student discount..)

I used to pay 4.99$ for no Ads services and it used to work fine. However, the main issue became Pandora wasn't working and synchronizing with my car. Most of the time, it would say" can't reach Pandora". I will not pay for an app that doesn't work!!!
I’m seriously considering a subscription
I love Pandora it plays all my favorite music!!!
Pandora keeps me company no matter what I'm doing!
Driving me crazy. Have to close app and reopen to get it to play in my car.
Gotta pay for add free listening and no offline listening
Great stations, great layout, great application.
Works fine on my phone for about 20 minutes or so then during mid song, it shuts down and also shuts my phone off. It’s only this app. It’s not my phone. I’ve noticed it every time i use the pandora app. I even tested it with my other music apps and my phone is normal with other apps. It’s only the Pandora app that stops playing music out of nowhere and shuts down as well as my phone. That’s the only issue i have with mine. Other than that, it works fine.
Its always there when I need it, whatever my mood it adapts with me !
Blessed to have Pandora, all the artists that help with the words my spirit needs and blessed above all to have JESUS CHRIST!!

Se la vacilan
Each time I start the app there is a connectivity issue. I thought it was my phone, service provider, WiFi etc, but when all of those things were adjusted I have the same issue . I have to restart the app several times before it works. While driving, I just want to skip a song, NOT go through an ad to get back to the controls to then skip. Can you only ask that I upgrade Once per use or day
I love getting all this music FO' Free, hands down, no questions asked...  except if I'd like to write a review.  Stay cultured and wonderful, Music World!!!
All of my favorite songs back to back I can’t stop singing or dancing and I can’t even get sleep because I can’t stop moving! I love you guys music lives on forever!!
I love my pandora and I can’t wait until I can meet the person who treats me like that I am not forgotten about rather I just want you to know that I’m not going to say that you don’t know me nor I you point blank period it can never alter a fathers “downonmykneespleeeease” pa-pa-pa pleeeaaaaaaasssssssssseeeeeeeeeee (Inmybigdaddyvoice I LOVE YOU OZZY!!!!!

Do not like the fact that if I’m not connected to my WiFi pandora does not work. That makes no sense especially when I have cellular data.
Since the update I can’t get Pandora to work, it just keeps crashing!

It’s a great app however the selection of songs aren’t that great. Especially in the today’s hits
Not bad at all
I love the music that plays in every category                 Thank you                      Dawn 
So many stations and really good songs ☺️‼️
I have tried another stations but I always come back to Pandora. You guys have the best music selection ever!!❤️
But I really wish you guys could play the songs I like more on my thumbprint station but out of everything else I Iove u guys thank you so much 🖤
I’m really enjoying this music, it has taken me back some years and I LOVE IT...
I totally recommend this it’s free music and who doesn’t want that it’s amazing u can pick any artist I love it it’s so good download it
Covertly made me purchase pandora premium and the unsubscribe option was deeply hidden. Plays same songs often and will group songs by genre when on shuffle. I’ll get 4-5 songs of rap, then 4-5 songs of dance, then 4-5 of punk, etc. a real shuffle would be more random
App starts but music never plays. Hmmmm not the best performance for a MUSIC app.  But yet the aid reviewers are having a great time!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I have been listening to Pandora for years I don’t mind the ads as they keep in touch with my home state  Long live pandora 
Thank you for your awesome music!
They littt❤️❤️❤️
It won’t even let me create an account
I don’t think that you get enough skips. Some of the songs I don’t like and I can’t skip them.   Thank you!!👌🏼 
Loving Thumbprint Radio! Plays all my favorite songs!
Love the music
Absolutely love it!!
Thank You , for putting together my group of music, to my taste while adding new music in ! Perfect mix ... been enjoying for years and now pandora has become even more great ! Thanks for the good times !
I love that whatever mood you’re in you can find any music on here to fit your name thank you so much for creating this music channel for all of us
Love it, I have all my music on my phone, and it’s awesome!! It would be better without commercials, however still play it instead of the radio....
I got Spotify and it wasn’t good but I found pandora best decision I have ever made I love listening to free music I love
Very good - but could be better...  Once you work on a station for a while (by ‘liking’ songs) you can hit play and let it run for a while - but don’t expect to like everything on a new station.  I wish there was more customization in the stations, and I wish you could get more ‘skips’ by listening to an add or something.  Whenever I run out of skips I just station-hop until I find something I can stand to listen to - since even a ‘thumbs down’ (ie: don’t play this again) will still make you endure that song.
I’m using an iPhone 8 and with the recent app update Pandora rarely works via Bluetooth in my 2015 Honda. Before the most recent update it worked well.
This app (if used correctly, with the thumbs up/thumbs down on at least the MAJORITY of the songs it plays - it gets a little tedious if you’re listening for an hour straight) learns your style precisely, over time. It’s amazing to me that now, when I turn on my country station, I get any and all of my favorite artists and songs - and ONLY my favorites (98% of the time). When I turn on my hip hop station, I get practically the same thing (wider genre, i.e. it takes longer for the app to perfect your style). I highly recommend this app to ANYONE who loves music (so... pretty much everybody) and doesn’t mind the ads, which allow it to continue to be free.
The best!!!
You can play it when your phone is off
It great
Like Pandora! Good and nice.
With the new “upgrade” I can’t access any of my stations! 😫 its a down grade!
I was introduce to Pandora three years ago by a friend. I like the idea that one can pick and choose what they enjoy listening to. I am grateful for the ads that are so kind To make it possible for people who can't afford a regular subscription to be able to enjoy music of choice. I keep telling myself that when I get Rich that I will be able to subscribe a year at a time. In the meantime, thank you for being so kind to make music accessible to everyone.
They are amazing singers and performers😘 -Kylah Hodges😘😘 
Love it
GET TO PICK AND PLAY MY JAMS... DANCING TO THE BEAT WHILE I DRIVE.
Helps me out every time
I listen to Pandora all the time all day sometimes!! Always my go to!!
It is incredible how well it interprets thumbs up/down to build Amazing play lists.  Like having your own radio station with the best program director of all time.  I put in an artist give it some guidance and it picks my favorite songs out of thin air.  It’s like a shuffle with no lame songs.  One of the greatest advances for music lovers in the last 5 decades.
I am terribly disappointed with the recent update. I have had a relatively pleasant experience with pandora prior to the update. The app crashes constantly & if I am utilizing another app at the same time that I am listening to pandora all my other apps crash as well. It is extremely frustrating to not be able to listen to a full song.
I’ve recently created a Halsey radio. I’m currently without WiFi so Pandora is the only music app that works for me so I have to depend on what comes in their radio. My issue is they REFUSE to play any Halsey on my Halsey radio. When I first created it they played her songs and I thumbs up‘d all of them. Now they never play any of her music. Not a single song. I feel like they’re doing it on purpose. I literally skipped through a hundred songs hoping my favorite Halsey song would play and they never played one of her songs despite it being her radio. They actually repeat other songs like ten times that I didn’t even give a thumbs up instead.  Not to mention a lot of the songs that they’re playing are nothing like her music. It just doesn’t make any sense to me.
Enjoy all the oldies but goodies 😀
It the BEST😎✅!!
Too many commercials
The idea of the non-premium $4-$6 ad-free version of Pandora is lofty and admirable. Create a station of your favorite artist, add other favorite bands and artists for variety, click thumbs up on tracks you like, thumbs down on ones you don’t, and in time Pandora’s software will know you like a best friend.   But in reality what you get is a friend who learns absolutely nothing, interprets thumbs up as you’d like to hear the same song every day for the rest of your life, and secretly hates you by playing artists which you can’t stand under their banner of being a “music discovery” service.   So after approaching a repetitive motion injury from clicking thumbs down over and over I emailed Pandora customer service about my frustrations with their service. They respond back with a load of jibber-jabber about limited licensing agreements and encourage me to upgrade to their premium service for over double the price with absolutely no enticement of an introductory offer to do so.  A quick google searches reveals Spotify is waiting in the wings to snatch my business away from Pandora at an introductory price of $0.99 for three months for their premium service. So I sign up for Spotify, created the very play list I hoped Pandora would have by “knowing” me in under an hour. Next I’m dumping Pandora like the bad friend I hoped would some day be nice to me, and a four year relationship with their streaming service is over.  Yes I could have upgraded to Pandora’s premium service and perhaps had been just as happy as I am with Spotify. But Pandora, you guys ticked me off, slowly and repeatedly over several years by not delivering on promises. And lots not even get into how poorly you work with Honda’s built in Pandora feature. I’m giving you two stars instead of one as thanks for irritating me to the point of finding a better music streaming service. 
The best app
Pandora plays all of my favorite songs and some I don’t like but its fine because no one can be perfect🦄🦄🦄💙💙💚💚💛💛🖤🖤🧡🧡
I love how it picks up artists that I might like !!
It stays on for as long as I want it to ilysm Pandora’s
Pandora used to be great, no issues always worked.. for about a month now nothing but issues.  Music won’t play have to restart the app once if not twice, used to work fine but for some reason it refuses to open, it crashes, and has bugs
It is so awesome to listen to my favorite music.
My Cardi B radio has been playing Moana soundtracks and country music. Don't get me wrong, I love both of them, but when I want to listen to Washpoppin' by Cardi or HUMBLE. by Lamar, the last thing I want/expect is You're Welcome! (Moana) and Body Like a Backroad (Sam Hunt) I have separate stations for that. I'm not leaving a bad review, because I'd use Pandora every day. It's awesome. ❤️
To many commercials I can’t Afford to pay for the premium service
I am always pleased with Pandoras selection. They are the best!
I love my Pandora!
I bought a new car three months ago and got a free 3 month premium off to try out. I downloaded the app and tried starting an account, and it would not take any of my credit card information. I reached out time and time and time again to Pandora and OnStar.  BOTH companies phone calls resulted in hang ups or parked calls. Pandora left me for 20 minutes then hung up.   Emails to Pandora result in an endless line of questions and doubts about my offer code existence. The code should have expired on 31 Dec but funny thing is that it expired last night and they refuse to work with me without a code so I'm done. 
How is it that the 3rd most popular music app in the App Store still hasn’t had an iPhone X update? It’s very disappointing because the old software doesn’t work some of the time on the new phone. Huge let down.
It is kind of a pain to play whatever songs u want and very annoying that u can only skip and replay songs so many times but other than that I love it
Love the music choice.❤️
Awesome station keeps me calm and relax couldn’t ask any better than this.
I love it
I love pandora!it is the best way to get any kind of music you want! Thanks pandora for giving me a great listing experience!
This is the best! It has all the music i want to listen to without very many adds! LOVE IT!😱😱😱😱😱😍😍😍😍
🔥🔥🔥
The upgrades makes enjoying my music much more pleasurable experience.    Thanks! 
Love being able to have comedy skits of infamous icons. Awesome !
Don’t mind the length of commercials... but the quantity in order to get us to purchase commercial was is crazy
Piece of junk doesn't work outside the US.  Can't even open the app to unsubscribe. Also, recently the app has been awful even in the US. Keeps playing terrible offline stations when it loses signal, doesn't come back to the oline station. Going from Wi-Fi to LTE, it doesn't continue playing. Doesn't fully support iphonex. Just awful. Spotify and Amazon music are way superior now. 
I have been having recent issues since the last update, the app crashes, and every time I open another app while using my Pandora the music stops, it also stops suddenly while listening to it... Please fix this app, I’ve been paying it for 2 years now, and would like to continue as long as this issue is fixed ASAP!  My app it’s still having issues :/ 
We live pretty much off grid.  I guess as much as you can, with all the whipulons 🤓flying around in the air that there are!  No TV or radio reception.  Pandora is good music for me.
The music that I grew up with and I am enjoying pandora very much and thanks pandora for the great music
Repeatedly plays the same songs on a station. Also the app crashes constantly.
Whenever I’m not sure what to listen to I put on Pandora. But I dislike that when you choose an artist station it will play completely different artists.  I dunno, it’s just something for when I dunno what I want to listen to, not my favorite, but helpful.
Pandora is a great app for listening to music when you need it. I use it all the time
I loved this app but recently I have been having all types of issues.  Since I gotten my new iPhone X and Apple Watch I have nothing but issues.  I have to completely close the app to stop listening and the app freezes and you can still hear music but you can pause, skip songs and switch stations.
Great app but to many ads
Without a fix the app is unusable on my iPad.  This iPad is dedicated to playing music..  Long time user and have been totally satisfied up until now.  Please fix ASAP  **** Solution was to reboot iPad.  Fast response from developers!

My Honda Pilot no longer interfaces with Pandora nor can I get it to stop playing when I’m done listening and getting out of the car. And it no longer displays song info in my lock screen. What the hell?
Thank you for giving a great selection of genres. The songs are on point!
Pandora is love
Love my station. The only drawback is when I put in the artists’ name Pandora doesn’t play a lot of that particular artist’s music. Pandora would be better if they played more music by artist that I keyed in for my station! That’s a hint Pandora!

The very best experience I have ever had in my life with music! God's blessings.
Amazing app!! If you don’t know now you know, from one of the realest unknown.. which is how I like it🙏🏼🔥👌🏽💨💨
I just feel so good Listening to Pandora. Yeah!! 
Ever since I’ve gotten a iPhone X my pandora keeps glitching the controls won’t work music will continue playing have to close the app for music to stop playing out loud
I always sleep while listening to music, specifically on pandora, other than the ads the piss me off no matter what, I found that the app basically completely shuts down when it hits midnight, I check my internet, restarted it, and even restarted my iPad AND phone completely, but it will give me something saying the station is currently unavailable for use, please use another station, to which I do and it says the same thing, from times it will play a song on the station for half a second and then stop it again, please fix this
Wish that there was a way 2 not only pick artists, but tracks as well.
Awesome stations!!
Did the update, now My Pandora doesn’t even work! I was a faithful listener and hesitated on updating, wish I never did! Don’t do it!

I wanna make babies with Pandora  it's so good I call it Dorapan. It's my drug.  To devs: being able to have song names scroll to view the entire name would be nice. 
I love it
It’s great
Plays all my jams!
I have been a diehard Pandora fan for years but I’m ready to throw in the towel. The app has had so many issues. I can’t get it to turn off. It won’t sync right with my car anymore. I’ve been waiting on an update hoping there was a fix, but no update has come. It used to be pure enjoyment. Now it’s constant frustration. Please fix or I’m moving on!
Pandora is one of the pioneer in internet radio, however they do live to the expectations. The selection of music are limited. When you left the music running for long time, they will tell you if you are still listening as  that they are paying every song your hearing. As if they are blaming you. Im still listening to Pandora as Im still able to get free premium account for free for limited time. But without that one, Im already in Spotify.
Buy the app to find out more! They will give you a hour of pandora premium! They have the best music choices! YOU NEED TO GET THE APP BOW
After using the app for 3 songs my phone will reboot, ask me for my passcode and it only seems to happen when I use this app only!
I’m a premium user that since November, has not been able to use my service because it won’t play any of my playlists. I’m having a hard time finding contact information for customer service.

Been trying out Pandora Premium with my Google Chromecast at home. Mostly works great, however I noticed that the “Top Songs” feature on the artist pages seems to get stuck “Buffering” every time I try it. However the feature works fine when listening on my phone without Chromecast. Seems like just a Chromecast issue.   Also would be great to have a feature that allows one to add an Artist to My Music instead of only being able to add stations, songs, or individual albums. 
My play button doesn't work. I have to press skip to the next song when opening the app to get it to play at all, it won't work when just opened on the first song and I try to press play.
It takes you canceling a credit card to get rid of it
Pandora es el espejo donde se reflejan todos los valores artisticos latinos  (RD, PR, Cuba, MEX, COL, VEN, ESP, TODO CENTRO Y SUR AMERICA). 
Great product
I listen to all Songs all Music and Whatever On ;)   Fairytail90 
All I hear on my fm radio station is iheart radio commercials. Sick of iheart and I don’t even listen to it. I have listen to Pandora for several years and have went all over the southeast and never had a problem.  Thank you Pandora!!! G in Mississippi. 
I’m so loving it, thank you Pandora!
Very good
Pandora takes my mind from childhood to the present🙏
The original
Too many Spanish speaking commercials. There should be an option on the language you want to here.
Not sure what happened but for the last 2-3 months the app crashes all the time are will not load. I used to love it and now I would not consider going premium.
Pandora is amazing a putting to together awesome mixes..:
Plays the jamz i wanna hear
I still have to open the app two to three times for the music to start playing. When it disconnects from Bluetooth, it continues to play on the phone.
Pandora does mess up sometimes but the content makes up for it . It’s like you pick the right song everytime !!! Keep up the great work 💜
Always plays great music with related artist.
Our whole family uses this about every day to get the music we each love...Also there are great comedy stations!
I was excited that Pandora had an Apple Watch app to be able to listen to Pandora on my runs when my phone wasn’t with me.  But this app is worthless for that. All it serves as, is a remote control for the app on my phone. If you’re Apple Watch is connected to cellular, and you’re phone isn’t around, it does nothing. When the phone is around, it sends the sound straight to the phone instead of the headphones paired to the Apple Watch. Please fix the pointless Apple Watch app or remove the pointless capability all together.
There simply is nothing better. Period.
Great sounds
Why TF do I have to download this app rather than using it on my browser. It always redirects and won’t let me use the desktop version. Smh
Wow, pandora you have it all🤗
Amazinggggg!!!💞😋
But what happened to my bubble gum oldies station, that was the first station I had & loved it. Now it’s all mixed up .spirit in the sky should not be playing on bubble gume oldies. So subscription or not doesn’t make a difference.pandora has major static going on😞 plus they keep asking me to up grade I click no, I’m already at premium, plus why would I upgrade when I got the Judd’s radio station and it’s not all Judd’s, just like the B.B. king is not all B.B. king. So that needs to be straightened out. Also to I’m already 4.99 premium, I should not be forced go another 12.99, I think 5.00 bucks a month is enough. They keep throwing that pop up. Plus I keep getting adds now and then . So what’s my 5.00 a month paying for?  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing with your stations!

I downloaded the update and guess what? The pause button still doesn’t work!  iPhone X, latest Pandora update as of this review. 
It rocks
The Best
Good stuff, love the music
Dec 29, 2017 update- I have given Pandora more then enough time to figure out their Bluetooth issue. Many of the reviews on here complain of the same issue. Sad that Pandora chooses to place this critical issue for me and many others, as a low priority for them to fix. I have canceled my subscription and now using another music service. Does your executives know about your Bluetooth issue ? No wonder you are losing many listeners.  ————— Pandora doesn’t work with my 2016 Honda Accord Bluetooth or Pandora car app 90% of the time. I have an iPhone X. It now only works with CarPlay. Tunein Radio app and iHeartRadio app work without issue with my car’s Bluetooth, so it’s not a Bluetooth issue with my car or phone. This issue is widely reported in the App Store reviews and in online forums.   Deleting app and reinstalling didn’t fix issue. I’m using the latest version that came out on Nov 28.   I have now given up on Pandora and moving on to another music app. I was a paying subscriber. They are incompetent on getting their issues with their app fixed. It’s no wonder they are losing subscribers left and right.  Edit - In response to the developer’s response - I have contacted your support team in Nov 2016 on the issues Pandora was having in consistently connecting to my 2016 Accord integrated Pandora app. After numerous email exchanges and diagnostics, your support team said “we are aware of this issue and are working on it”.   You have been working on this issue for over a year with no improvements. And now your app is having issues with just a standard Bluetooth connection without using the Honda’s integrated Pandora app.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I had a $4.99 account subscription for years and then one day the Pandora app was having problems. I deleted it reinstalled it signed in to find all my stations gone. No help option at all and to top it off Pandora was asking me to sign up for an upgrade which I already have. Absolutely despicable company as far as I’m concerned. Nice going Pandora you just lost a paying customer who had been with you for years.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble!

Happy new year 2thousand 18 🙏🏾🌹
With the decline of the beloved mixtape, Pandora has saved the day, and night, and the in between. I love you Pandora for filling my days with joy, especially when I forget that my job is to prioritize joy. Lots of Love, Jules
Simple and reliable with anything I want to have at hand in terms of favorite genres and artists.
Hey
Wish would could skip more songs!
Less commercials add n more skip
In the middle of a meeting with my manager and coworkers, pandora, which was minimized and paused, started blaring out music. My phone was locked and I had no alarm set. My boss found it funny but I did not
Pandora has been my go to for work, driving and just relaxing. It is so convienent and reliable. You get the variety of music you want without hunting it down from station to station, thank you Pandora!!! JZ 
Enjoy listening to Pandora  while working running and even relaxing.  Good choice of songs, instrumental music with a wide variety 
I love pandora it’s my favorite app to use for music. But one of the things I don't like is that sometimes the app gets frozen and you have to exit the app. Another thing that I don’t like is that I’m connected to WIFI and pandora still says must connect to WIFI when I’m already connected. I’ve tried turning my phone off and back on but that didn’t work. Then I deleted the app and then reinstalled it, and opened the app and it did the same thing.
Best music station app out there.
Great app.
Love love love
This Pandora app is supposed to cast the music directly to your Sonos devices. However, I am always having issues with the music cutting off and the app disconnecting from my system. Issue an update and fix this please it is very annoying.
Way too many commercials I mean I know you have to have some .. but you guys over do it .. sometimes it’ll be three commercials in a row and the same ones over and over ... might have to try I heart radio ... and songs get mixed up .. I’ll have a rap song on when it’s a trance station ..I’ve been a listener going on 9 years wouldn’t wanna leave :/ by might have to
I love pandora it’s great and I love all the music stations available. It’s great for the summer playing music and everything else. However there is one downside and that is the ads but we can’t really control them. All in all it’s great and you should get it.
Best ever 2017......ready for the 2018
Pandora has been slacking, non stop advertising, and not being able to skip songs, is pretty out dated.
This app helps me when I don’t have money to buy songs
Loved the app for a long time. The depressing adds you had on in the fall are gone, thank goodness. Now I'm finding that the audio and visual don't match some of the time and it can take five minutes to change a station. When it loads it has the station I listened to last. When I go to change the station, the station changes but the last song from the previous channel still plays until it's done, then an add comes on, then it will shift to the new channel. That's over five minutes of sitting there waiting to heard the station I want to listen too.  Can we sync a little faster?
Great selection of all kinds of music! Love the channel saving, can go from my Country to Metal in just one click...  all day listening while in background is great, still answer incoming calls and picks up right where it left off with no issue every time!!! Great app!!! 
I have been a paying subscriber for a while , several years, however their latest SW updates have been lame. The lock screen doesn't necessarily show the Pandora control while driving which doesn't allow Microsoft Sync control, a song will come up but it's not playing the right song, for some reason 'The Weeknd' station will kick me off eventually with the 'this station is not currently available' msg. I'm annoyed enough to find this review place to write a review. Hire some better programmers or do some better test integration, please! Before you release new SW updates.
I've been a subscriber to Pandora One for years. It used to be great. The most recent update broke the dock connection with my 2016 CRV. I need to do a special sequence of plugin in the phone while the app is a special state of loading. Every time I get a call I need to repeat the process to get the app to reconnect. I spent 3+ hours a day in the car, and this is not acceptable for a service I am paying for.
No hay mejor app para escuchar música q esta, Pandora. Gracias por existir! 😀
I absolutely love Pandora has all my favorite songs I don’t know what I I would do without it has change my song opinions and life helps me get through thing like cleaning and stress and sleeping.🤗☺️😊😀
It’s so awesome
Pandora gives me peace in my everyday life.  I listen to the Paul Hardcastle Radio and it just melts my day away. 
With tha music
Nice for a free app.
Routinely have to cancel the 12.99$ / month membership that it sets up when you open the app if you leave your thumb on home long enough for the pop up to sneak in.
Pandora is terrific!
I don’t like how after a certain amount of time it stops to asks if your still listening, and then I have to go and turn it back on to play. That is super frustrating. How about it just plays until I shut it off?!
This app is super buggy on iPhone X. The lock screen controls do not work properly and when you remove AirPods, it doesn’t pause, it just starts playing through the phone speaker.
I wish I could play the songs I search for right away and create playlists with the songs I like
Awesome variety of music when you need and where you are...
Why does pandora never work. I have to open and close it out multiple times to get it to play music. It almost never shows up when my phone is locked. And it’s annoying to pay for something monthly that doesn’t work.
Pandora just ...gets me
Now whenever I click back to switch through stations it starts back in the middle of the song I just tried to avoid, and it never did this before so yeah I don’t suggest downloading it get Spotify instead  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing!

If you get the free app, your music will be constantly interrupted and you only can skip the music you don't like for limited times. However, I tried for a month the subscription of $5 and now I feel free. I can do my exercises without loose the rhythm !
App keeps crashing and restarting my phone
I LOVE PANDORA! This is the most convenient music app for me. It’s even gave me pandora premium for free!!( I have no credit card information in my phone)
Great app!
Loves too use this misique
Premium is definitely worth it but please add support for iPhone X!
Always on my Pandora app it’s a great app  Pandora gives lots of options and very little advertisement which is ok to stay informed about new products but again they are a few here and there I’d say five to three thanks 
Awesome !!!!!!
The app has issues that pisses me off, like when im in my car and i turn my car off and then get back in and turn it back on i always have to restart my phone for Pandora to start playing again, i heart radio app dont do that, but Pandora plays more variety of music on my favorite channel
Pandora has continued to improve its ability to identify the style of music you prefer to hear.  While at times it can pick out some something that seems totally unrelated to your genre, at least they don’t play the same 25 song play list for six months at a time.
Good app just needs to be updated for the iPhone X.
So perfect to be able to listen to music of my choosing anytime day or night. If I am in the mood for Instrumental or Country or Christian music, its at my fingertips. Thanks for all the hard work to keep us happy. Keep up the good job P.
Thank you for being so awesome!!
Love how I can dance when I want to
I just wanted to say what a class act this company is. I was offered a free trial of the paid version and when it ended that was it! They did not just start auto charging me. I got so hooked on the premium version and was so happy Pandora didn’t just auto charge me that I’m hooked for life. EVERY APP out there should take note: that’s the way it’s done! You give customers a truly free trial with no strings attached and people will gladly keep buying your product. It’s also a great app. I’ve tried others but Pandora for me is the most user friendly and reliable.
So sorry but disappointed inthe high cost and greed of the Pandora Corporation/company. I am currently looking forward to finding a new outlet.   Kathy 
Not happy,had a Great One rollin, To ROCKnROLL,oh well maybe next time
Pandora has introduced me to many songs I wouldnt have otherwise found, not necessarily new or popular ones. Also great playlist tailoring.
I am deleting this app due to the fact that they force you to endure a 30 second ad after almost every three songs now.
Best thing I ever did
Generally great app. It has decent AI and quickly identifies themes in music selection based on your thumbs up and thumbs down. My one issue with Pandora is the free version has to many commercials.
Omg I love this app it is amazing. I have all of my fav songs and a whole lot more
Pandora rocks!
Love love love it !!!
I’m tired of the system not understanding that I push the freaking button to NOT NOW ever time I open the app!! I think I’ll just decided to uninstall the app completely. I’m just tired of the hassle. That & no option to cancel the Premium via my mobile phone. But that’ll probably be no use because I’ll have to to that on a daily basis because the app doesn’t register that I DO NOT WANT PREMIUM!!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble.

I like the Thumbprint radio but I feel like there should be more variety when it comes to new songs that match my preferences.  If that could be added or fixed with an update I will rate Pandora as a 5 Star music app!!!
Keeps crashing I have no idea why. My whole phone actually crashes and the screen goes black and reloads. I will just be deleting this app
I absolutely love PANDORA listen to music is Life. I’m very thankful for Pandora and once I can afford it I’m going to upgrade!!!
Been pandora user since beginning love every minute of it
The music selection is pretty enjoyable, depending on what you like listening to. It's helped me discover some great songs and artists. That's about all that's good about it though. There are two ads every other song, a very limited number of skips, and sometimes it plays songs unrelated to the genre you selected. Additionally, with the new update, you're no longer able to view your bookmarks. You can still create bookmarks for some reason. You just can't view them. Stick with Spotify.
The song accurately describes my current emotions!
I like pandora but it’s been operating a bit janky with these latest iOS updates. I can’t access things like before and it freezes and shuts off randomly.
Pandora is nothing but the truth.
Let us pick the song an not wait for it to come on plz plz That would be really helpful  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Thanks for the feedback.

I’ve had Pandora music app for many years now and I love it, all my stations play my favorite songs all the time! I love a variety of music and have other music apps but my pandora is tuned especially for me!
The app is good and all no much to say about it but there is a small problem on a radio station that i listen to, the radio station C-Kan would play American country music which has nothing similar to with the genre that i listen on the this station and i would appreciate it if it could be fixed because i don't enjoy that type of music and if nothing is yet to be fix i will end my subscription.
I love pandora! It’s absolutely my favorite source of music
This app has some great features, I was a previous user of Spotify and I didn’t have Premium and this app is great even if you don’t have premium it blocks out Cursing and other things that are appropriate. GET THIS APP ITS LIT👍🔥
I love music to think and relax and be happy if I don’t have a Smart phone but I have a iPhone now and thank u for begin in my life 
My first experience with Pandora was back in 2007.  It has matured since then.  I discontinued my old account and decided to try it again recently.  I really like the variety and depth of pieces available on the Classical Music station.    I also like listening to rock ‘n’ roll, and so sometimes when I move I put on rock ‘n’ roll station on Pandora. Probably the best part about having Pandora on my phone is being able to have different kinds of music. 
i love pandora !!
I like Pandora because I can listen a lot, then not use it for a while without worrying that I’m paying for something I’m not using. Selection is really good. It has exposed me to artists I didn’t know! I do miss the history they used to provide with each song.
Amazingly awesome

I’ve been using Pandora and it’s app for a very long time. Like back when Motorola had phones out... In the last couple of weeks I’ve noticed several persistent errors. Each time that my iphone tries to bluetooth link up to a a vehicle... doesn’t matter if is my Mercedes C class or Ford Explorer...not even a random rental car. Each time the app locks up to the point of needing to shut it down manually and restart. Also, even after a restart I have to shut the radio down and turn it back in to get volume. All is good until I leave the vehicle and return. It’s live die repeat... This error was with my iphone 6 last month. It’s with my iphone 8 this month that I just got. I even had one of my employee’s with a iphone 7 that I found to have the same error. I’ve been waiting for this error to be fixed with a recent update but nothing. Is this an Apple problem? Is it a Pandora problem? I’m getting close to cancelling my Pandora account over it. I just need to make sure that it’s not an Apple driven “error” to drive people to iTune’s.... 
I find a lot of new music through pandora and always love the surprise of what song will be up next. The only thing that bothers me is the commercials, but I’ve been using pandora for a few years now, i might upgrade and pay a few bucks for no commercials :)
App gay
Love listening to Pandora they always have my favorite artists
This app has always been my go to my stations are really MY stations
I have loved pandora, but here recently while I’m listening to it it shuts off at random while I’m on another app.its been bothering me.
The iPhone X has been out for a while now.  Pandora is probably one of the most widely used apps.  Why haven’t you optimized the app for viewing on the iPhone X??  Please fix this!
If I search up a musician, I expect to get their music, right? Not really. Because it shows tons of other songs from different people, and most of the time it's not even the same genre! It's also stupid that you have a skip amount, I eventually end up using iTunes.
I love Pandora. I love all the stations available and there is music for everyone.
Speechless Pandora number one
Amazing
You should be able to stream directly from the watch to Bluetooth headphones without your phone nearby...not sure what the watch app is for if you can’t do that
The original is not always the best in today’s environment. Intuitive and simple.
I love this app so much it is so awesome! I definitely recommend this app! You can add whatever stations you would like! They have any artist or station you can even imagine! There are not to many ads on this app do I definitely would download! Also great for nonstop music! I love it so much!!!!
Gracias

Always has good music
Great app, Great service and definitely my go-to for music. But there are pop-up ads every second and video ads after every other song, but I guess that’s what Plus and Premium are for.
Love the music💞
I use pandora just about every day in my car through Apple CarPlay. It seems anytime my phone goes from WiFi to LTE I have to close and reopen the app to get it to work. If my phone is locked the app won’t respond to apple CarPlay commands. This is because I can’t close the millions of popups through Apple CarPlay, they’re blocking me from using the buttons on my cars display. I’ll have to unlock the phone itself open the app close the popups then click play. If i pause a song while in the car before I get out and say go shopping for 30 mins and come back it won’t remember the fact I paused a song and it’ll just skip to the next.   Basically it seems anytime I hook it up to Apple CarPlay it forgets what the heck it was doing and needs reset on everything. What’s the point of Apple CarPlay if I have to use the phone 75% of the time? 
Yap that’s right
This is still my go-to music app, but the update putting advertising front and center is annoying. How about a split-screen of ads and cover art on the iPad version? The screen is big enough to support that. When I want to know what I’m listening to, I don’t want to see advertisements. I want to see the cover art. 
But can’t understand why it takes so long for little issues to get resolved with the app?? Both my iPad, and my iPhone X will have issues with the app freezing when relaunching. A minor issue that will be resolved with force quitting out of it. But you can’t expect me to pay money for something like this and not even have optimization for the X yet...
Muy buena selección de música, me encanta.
Is wonderful. I quit listening to the radio. I enjoy songs at the touch of a finger.
Best app
Thanks for the great day
I use it everyday when I clean and everyday all day
Not sure what is going on, but my phone will crash periodically when listening to Pandora. This doesn’t happen with other apps either.
The only app that works like it should
To many commercials even for being the free pandora.
It’s been months since the iPhone X’s release, and there’s still no update to optimize the app for the iPhone X’s display. It’s no secret that Pandora has been struggling to stay competitive with Spotify, Apple Music, and others, and lagging behind on updates like this don’t help Pandora’s case.
This is my favorite app to listen to music.
When the premium service will be available for Puerto Rico subscribers?... ending subscription & going with Spotify if delay.
I love Pandora.  Today’s music.  Music from when I was growing up. Whatever I want to listen to whenI want to listen to it!  Even got my parents listening to it!
I like your product but what’s with all the comecals
Really been enjoying pandora for a while now. They only thing lately over the past 6 months there has been glitches shutting itself off and constantly trying to log into Facebook without my permission.
It amazing it got all the r&b I love
I love it thank you so much for great music

My only issue is sometimes when I search a station using a specific song I get to hear everything but the song. I hate that I have to pay to upgrade if I want to skip or replay. Otherwise it’s great!
If you don’t mind random songs with a few commercial breaks this is a perfect music app for you.
Love it
Is it just me or have they just added more commercials lately seems like that’s all there is new it was too good to be true! I don’t mind watching a short video to get an hour free listening! Sound quality is good. I’m currently using iPhone 6 Plus
Love love love Pandora 😘😘😘
This pandora is so great you can play any station you would  Iike! I love this pandora 
I love Pandora.   Great Music, easy to use on all devices.
I am finding that it buffers a lot more to get the music & that I am having a harder time with finding my stations instead of albums. I rather listen to stations not just albums. I can’t figure out how to down grade off the premium I feel they make it impossible to do so. You can’t do it inside the app so you have to do it in the App Store but can’t find how. I think I rather use amazon prime music. Much easier & it’s free. Now to figure out to down grade this pandora!!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble.

Let’s be honest guys the app has been terrible since the latest iOS drop and the move to iPhone X. Blue tooth audio connection is terrible. Information isn’t being sent to the screen and the app freezes all the time. Not acceptable when paying for service.
Every single time i get on pandora and i pause it it automatically starts playing again in the background i have to fully close the app it wasn’t like that before it got to the point where even if i did fully close the app it would start playing out ignorance were  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry to hear that!

Great App
There should be less commercials and more than 5 skips on songs
It’s great I love it
I’ve had pandora plus for years yet every single time I open the app it begs me to upgrade to premium. If it weren’t for this annoyingly greedy pop-up advertisement this app would be a five-star app.
Always my morning pick me up❤️❤️❤️
I would like if I thumbed down something more than 10 times that it wouldn’t show up again until I look for it. And when I go to heathers radio I want to hear heathers, not Hamilton and literally everything but heathers. This really ticks me off, I can’t waste money on premium but I don’t think I should have too. Please do something about this.
I just noticed you charged me $12.99 dated December 24th, 2017.    How do I cancel my subscription please? That would be very much appreciated.

Been with Pandora music app for years. Tried other music apps, but Pandora is for me. It should be yours to.
Whatever the mood, dancing, nostalgic classic rock, Holiday, or meditation, I can always find the right mood on Pandora. 👍🏼🙂
I love it ❤️
Pandora constantly tries to log me into my Facebook, we also need a reconnect button if it doesn’t connect first time versus closing the app and opening again..landscape mode would be nice to with a car mode would be ideal as well for those who have their phone holstered.
The app on the iPhone X is a disgrace.  Most of the time it won’t start when I tag the play button or won’t stop when I tag the pause button.  I have deleted and reinstalled the app on my phone but it still does not work like it used to on my earlier iPhones.  I have to tag the skip button to get pass the hang up.  Looks like Pandora missed the boat for this app on the iPhone X and I have no idea if earlier iPhones are having this issue since the last update.  It is pretty bad when you can’t pause if playing or start if paused.
A wide selection of artists and styles and they never fail meet me right I need to be met. I have not been disappointed with anything I have listened to.
I often find that the song the station is named after hardly plays and I dont like the songs that play on the station.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Thanks for the feedback.

Most recent version is crap. The music won’t pause! I have to force quit the app to stop the music. Still not optimized for iPhone X which is BS. Every other app is. Get your act together pandora. In fact, as I was writing this review pandora just started on its own after I force quit the app.
I love the music. It constantly preventing you from doing things because it wants to post what I'm listening to on Facebook cost it a star.
Pandora is the best. I have no words to describe how good amazing Pandora IS.
I absolutely love pandora and subscribing was definitely a great choice but for the last month or so my Pandora has been extremely glitchy!! Half the time I get a notification, the music will pause and sometimes it’ll pause when I open up and app that wouldn’t normally cause it to pause. Please fix this soon because I’m having a hard time justifying paying for an app that is pausing all the time  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing!

Pretty good app Except the constant adds and limited skips. Been having problems with the app on my Apple Watch. Don’t know if its pandora or the watch with the problem.
I wish my sub wasn’t pre paid. What a waste of money. Can’t even hit the play/pause button among many other issues. Has really gone downhill the past few updates. Boo!
After having premium for almost a year I finally decided to uninstall it. The constant crashes, issues streaming downloaded music, and changing license issues with music have finally made me move on.   Oh, and there are 2 laws of Pandora; 1. Eventually, no matter the station type, an Eminem song will play. 2. If you thumbs up Eminem, that station is now an Eminem station. 
I have to say since pandora has started, it has always treated me amazingly. Keeping me pumped, happy and excited about finding new music and just about life. THANK YOU PANDORA
Very nice interface, and overall I am satisfied with the user experience. But as a classical music lover, and opera lover, I get a little tired of hearing the greatest hits over and over so I would appreciate more depth of offerings.
The best of the best. I can’t live without pandora. Thank you Pandora for great music and service.
Update this to support iPhone X to make the app better
Pandora brings me the best of all the music from my youth - which I shared with the men in my family. So to listen to each randomly selected tune is like a family Rey ion in real time. Thank you Pandora! ⚔️💜⚔️
Since 2008 I’ve been jamming to pandora 2018 wow time flys
I subscribe to Pandora. I love the music, artist and stations. A true 5 star rating. However, I have a few problems with Pandora and their app. I pay my monthly fee to listen with unlimited skips. But for some reason due to licensing issues I am unable to skip. Get rid off the song until I can skip like I pay to do. Also, when I use Pandora in my car, I cannot rewind/replay at all. Again, I pay to have this function. You need to fix these issues since I am a paying customer. Dissatisfied customer

Slow app and crashes
Love it, always arguing with friends that it’s better than Spotify. Only thing I don’t like is when I’m not feeling the songs they put on and I have no more skips and it’s ad after ad. And most of the times the ads are louder than the music can get. Edit: yeah that “on top of the world” shell advert is ear  piercingly loud
I just love pandora
Best app ever!!!!!!
I am an oldies fan to the bone and on Pandora I can find all of my oldies from R&B to Pop to it all. Thank you for feeding my addiction
Love the station, have had these stations for years. It is my constant companion. Have tried other copy cats, just not the same range or ease of use.  Mary M 
Thank you for a soundtrack to my days when times are toughest. Thank you for the only thing seemingly free to me. I don’t mind the commercials that allow it.
I love Pandora! My stations fit my life so well. Whether I’m working out, driving, with my kids, celebrating the holidays, or having an event I have music for the occasion. The commercial free version is worth it.
I like how pandora helps you explore new music
Well I have all ways used this app but it has to many ads.And that is take internet with is really annoying but good 3 stars
Love the variety!
Reliable source of music for a wide range of musicians
Pandora is my life I listen to it 24/7 even at school
I love pandora it is awsome it has all the songs I like
I love the music pandora put out!
Great app. Love the songs
Repeats too much of the same songs even if I gave a like to 200+ songs it still plays the same ones
Great songs but not enough skips
This is a great app to listen to all of my favorite artists, all of my favorite albums before I purchase the CD's I get to listen to them first and then decide.
I love pandora so much! I listen to music all the time and it’s the easiest way to listen to your favorite music.
Love it!
Muy buena estación pasan muy buenas canciones en todos los géneros no cambien
I love the variety I get to listen to not only gospel but country, oldies, and even some of the more hip stuff thanks for the variety
Just limit commercials and give more skips and allow replays of that song that minute
Best app ever.  So easy to use. I really enjoy pandora.  Let me listen to what I want to listen to.
Love pandora. It plays exactly what I want to hear, and introduces me to new music. However, after doing the most recent update, I am frustrated. If I do much as get an update from another app (such as Snapchat), my music will pause. When I started writing this review, it paused. If I wanted to pause while I was writing this review, I would easily swipe up and pause my music. No need for it to assume my actions. If the next update could fix this, that would be cool.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for the trouble you are experiencing!

Make the screen fit iPhone X and bring your price down Spotify don’t even cost this much and you can listen for free neither does Apple Music. You’re going to lose customers I only use it for Uber I will just stick to free but if the screen doesn’t get fixed I will just unsubscribe.
Fabulous and free!!
I love having intentional radio
As I mentioned in a previous comment, this amazing app was being taken over by an evil glitch. Now that the glitch is fixed, everything is back to normal, i’m back to enjoying all my favorite songs, and discovering new ones. The app is still just as amazing without premium, which I never bothered to try, the app is amazing as it is. And now all that is back. Although there is one thing that I always forgot to mention in my two previous reviews, advertising. The advertisements are not a severe problem, just merely annoying more than anything, you just finished an amazing tune, and then an ad pops up trying to get you to go to Six Flags. I know you cannot remove these, they are necessary, I’m mostly writing this part as a warning to anybody who had the patience to read up to here 😉. Although in the end, we all hate advertisements. 😁    Although I found a glitch in the new update, I am using Pandora on an iPad mini and when I turn off my device while using Pandora and turn it back on the lock-screen is stuck on “Burn by Ellie Goulding” it happened when I was listening to the song and had to leave my device for a moment, and now every time I use Pandora, this glitch happens. I don’t know if it is my device, or your app, thank you for reading my review.

Wish they would allow more skips but besides that I’m satisfied!
Always brings a tear.
Ok
Pandora used to be my go to music app. In recent weeks, however, it has not been working properly. I now frequently get a notification that there is no network available. Nothing has changed with my home WiFi and my internet service is fine. At other times, the app freezes when I open it.  I have to open and close it several times to get music to play. I have had a paid subscription for years but will very likely end up canceling it soon if things aren’t fixed. I see from other recent reviews I am not alone in the issues I’m having.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Pandora knows I like piano music so I have difficulty finding orchestrations and other types of presentations.
Love this station!!!
Love it! Love that my echo dot syncs to it. I get up in the morning say Alexa play pandora. It’s amazing.
Best way to listen to all of your favorite songs!
Enjoy every moment
Grate app for music and sometimes you get a hour uninterrupted. Nanakuli 95 
I’m listening to a station and every couple songs it starts playing a song under the wrong song label For instance I was listening to queen and some women starts singing a completely different song, hit replay starts playing the right song Other times were Christmas songs started playing and it’s slightly becoming annoying Please fix this pandora people 
Man you can’t act like you don’t be bumping this ish when you feel like hearing some good music.... home, work, cleaning out your car, in between classes at school, lunch break.... its always the thing to hit up and listen to your THUMBPRINT radio and just get it in!!!
It would it be the best app ever if skip ads and can skip unlimited songs I don't like
Great music
Maybe it’s because I started with Pandora, but I just keep coming back to it. 4.99 a month and I can listen to any genre I want to. It seems to be so much more intuitive for me to use. I play pandora during my massage sessions, and I never have to worry about something random and distasteful thrown in. I like the simplicity of it. I set up some stations, do some lines and dislikes, and it learns pretty quickly. It just works for me, for half the price of the other apps. I’ve tired iheart, Spotify, and iTunes. I like iTunes but why pay double for the same thing? I just like my pandora. It delivers.
Absolutely love pandora !!!
Can you listen to music on here without wifi
Easy to use app. I love being able to listen to music while I work or play. Would highly recommend a download.
I’ve been using Pandora since the beginning of 2010. Its a great app for finding new artists but it is very unpredictable. Sometimes when I use the app on my phone on my bedside dock it won’t let me pause the song that’s playing. And then when I take my phone off of the dock, it keeps playing and won’t let me pause it. I am then forced to close the app which is unfortunate if I happen to like the song that was playing. I’m afraid this might be the end of Pandora for me altogether
Just awesome 😁
It’s music and I love it, with Pandora it’s on an popin Pierre 62 yrs
Its good. i like it but the only thing dont like is the advertise

I do not like how they set up the format on this app. Did they test it out by driving and trying to change to a station at the same time?  They need to simplify the ability to change the station. As a rideshare driver I want to change on the fly. I don’t have time to swipe till I find the station give me a simplified list plz. I’m so annoyed.
I was honestly disappointed when I saw the Apple Watch app only paused/played it on your phone which is handy in certain situations but overall the app is ok 👌.
Overall listening quality has gone down even with the plus subscription. I’ve been a member with a few different accounts since 2011 but as of this year the app has had so many issues between not wanting to load even on the best network connection, opening itself up even when the app has been closed and killed and not updating offline stations. Maybe I’ll come back in a few months and see if there is some improvement, but for now i have a free 3 months of YouTube red.
Awesome app.  Addition of Sonos made it great.  One request would be able to add songs directly from app to my Apple Music library.
Just started listening 2 thumbprint radio, it’s like u guys are in my head! Lol how u go from Beethoven 2 ten crack commandments like that.. then switch it up wit a lil 3LW lmaoo! Thank You 🏆
What ever you are in the mood for there is a channel of music to sit on the porch to.
I pay for premium....every month there’s a new “bug”....I’ve had so many issues I don’t know where to begin. First of all my music only seems to work In “offline mode” but if I hit shuffle it plays the same song over and over and over again....oh then it pauses. Songs change half way through....to the same three songs. If online mode attempts to work it takes several minutes to go through a song it buffers most of the time then the app just shuts off. I would love to enjoy all pandora premium has to offer but month after month it has a new bug. It is 100% not my service or my data. I can be on WiFi and it still won’t work.

I like pandora. It’s great when you want to listen to new music. But it’s not always kid friendly. Sometimes I will be playing a song a some cuss words would slip. Also, the ads. Ads are constantly appearing. And when you want to skip a song and you are “out of skips” you have to watch a video. It’s ok, but please fix this!
The app would be perfect with no ads, otherwise no complaints.
Amazing music of my choice!!!
I been using pandora since the day it came out I just hate the ad other than that I love pandora
I like Pandora but12.99 per month is too high for premium service upgrade.
Since it came out and still loyal ..🐐..👌..#1 Thanks pandora!! 
Good music selection. Like how I can customize music to my taste.
I liked Pandora enough to get ad-free.. then T-Mobile let me try Premium for 3 months, and now I’m hooked. It has a fresh Pandora interface too.  My issue is that you can’t use the Premium interface to tell the “Radio” stations, or radio autoplay from that song you love, that you’re tired of a track, even though it’s thumbed up. I’d hate to have to thumbs down a good track.
Please update for iphone X, seriously it’s been awhile since it was released
Has a recent update deleted the ability to purchase the song from iTunes? I can’t find it anymore. Did they have a dispute with Apple?
You have increased you WiFi signal Out. Of all th apps yours Buffers  And turn your volume up You do it for your adds 
Great service & selections on 60s Radio setting. Accompanying notes on performers especially strong and informative.
I will be listening to a beautiful soft song and then the ads come on at about ten times louder than the music!😜
After I signed up for Pandora Premium I have not looked back.  Better music quality over the air and playlist/radio are way better than Spotify/Apple music with little to no customization. What’s skip btw? 
The best music app! I actually discover new songs everyday. The only thing that frustrates me once in a blue moon, is when you search for a certain artist and song and it doesn’t play till some songs later. BUT I still think Pandora is amazing 🙌🏼
3 months later. And there is still no update for iphone X. Make me wonder why i’m paying a monthly premium for service that is not optimized for the phone that I have
I love the variety! But I have had issues with the app crashing.
I have used Pandora for many years. Initially, I loved it, but after a couple of years, I noticed that there really isn't much variety after a while. They keep playing the same songs over and over, which is odd, considering I have wide and eclectic music tastes.  Also, I detest live versions of songs, but if I click thumbs down, I never get to hear the original. There should be a way to distinguish between different versions of the same song. 
Super awesome
😉
Love pandora 🙌🏼
The glitches are absolutely annoying 🙄
Love this app!!! Pandora is so good at connecting to the needs of my soul when it comes to what I’m craving musically!!!
Good!!!
I listen to Pandora almost every day at work. I don’t know that I could get through the work day without it! Merry Christmas!
I love Pandora! You give a variety of genres. You  are relevant with the times yet will take us back to a time period of our youth, 70s, 80s & 90s! Keep it up! Thanks for the entertainment. You are therapeutic!
The app plays great music
Super good app. Love this good app must have more good apps like this
It exposes me to new music for free. I select a song artist or genre, and they give me music similar to it. Not always the exact song, but often music similar enough that I can enjoy it. There is a like and dislike system. Disliking a song makes it so that you will never see it in that playlist again. Liking it mean you will see it more often and I believe it helps to narrow done or widen that channel towards what you dean is good.
Upgraded to premium for the advertised features (which brought me back from competitors’), and absolutely hate the premium version of the app! Don’t bother upgrading, the app is such a pain to use that the upgraded features in premium are largely inaccessible.
Been using pandora a long time. Phone to phone, I stick w Pandora.
I love pandora. Gospel is my favorites. Gets me through any storm.
It’s pretty cool buuuttt too many comercial fam 🙄
This is great! But I wish there were not so many ads but I do know that’s how they keep it free but other than that it’s great!
Awesome
DO NOT GET PREMIUM!!!! They took all $25.25 out of my account, this is all my iTunes money I just got for Christmas, they said it was free and would not charge me until the end of the month, but then charged me twice once before when I started the free trial and once after I deleted the app and re downloaded it  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I always find a station that I want. All I have to search for is the song, and the band or person comes up. It is a super reliable source for music. This, the music loaded on my computer and my phone and YouTube are the only things I listen to.
Updated the app today and now the app wont open. It just crashes after 30 seconds of loading.
Ever since the last update the lock screen part of the app does not show the time moving on the track or how long it has been playing.
Used to work good now it’s freezing constantly. Please fix. Paying for an app that doesn’t work half the time isn’t acceptable it’s not like I’m paying half the price of your subscription.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Look, I’ve had this app since 2009 with no problems what so ever. Now, as a paying subscriber i have been struggling for the last two months because it has not been working right. I have to repeatedly open and shut down the app to get it to work right anymore. FIX IT.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I love Pandora already but today I discovered my Thumbprint Radio made from many of the songs I have given a thumbs up to.   Awesome feature !
radio station are best curated than most other competitors
Awesome country music
MOST TIME Pandora stops and closes the app by itself. iPhone 7 running most current versions.
I've been using Pandora for years but I'm going to try Spotify now because the Pandora iOS app doesn't work with Bluetooth (Airpods, car audio, ...). Sometimes it works after force quitting a few times. Otherwise you hit Play and nothing happens.
This app is amazing it has all of the songs that I enjoy listening to and many new songs that I have never listened to. One major down side to this app is that u need premium to get unlimited skips and to listen offline. It also has adds and glitches sometimes. However my over all experience with this app is good and I recommend it if u love listing to music.
Nice
Great music great quality
I think Pandora is a good one on the Apple App Store. It is useful.
I absolutely love this app all I don't like is the ads and skip limit. Don't we all lol this is the most used app on my phone.
I love it
The best music in the country
Really enjoy it!!!
Where do I find the bookmarks on the new update???!
Love the music
is lit af
Love the variety of music found on Pandora
I’m very impressed with how you have improve and have more selects for listen types.  I sure hope in the future you will also get TV.
Pandora is a nice. Umm I like how it a plays music very nice.
The best Internet Radio out there
Pandora is a great source of your favorite genre of music, and I love Thumbprint radio.
Pandora is the best because pandora is not like YouTube because YouTube when you put a song and when you exit out of YouTube the music stops but pandora is different because when you put a song and exit out the music still is on
I gave it only 4 stars because I can't play the music that I want.
I understand the concept of ‘free’ radio. I understand needing to advertise to make up the funds. However I don’t want to hear a Rap ad when I’m listening to easy listening or Xmas music. Maybe screen your ads according to the station.
Best app ever love that’s it’s free and one can still customize ❤️! Pandora did it right!!!
Every now and then pandora will bring up a "you cannot browse this page at..." Screen and I'm not able to back out. BUT! Pandora has always been my go-to music app. I have had no other problems with this app. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone that's looking for a great music app!!!
Crashes often, yet consistently bugs me to upgrade my account daily. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but that did not work. How about instead of trying to get me to upgrade you work on the quality of your application???
ENJOYABLE...!!
I’ve used Pandora for years and I absolutely loved it. Recently the music stops playing and I need to restart it. Not sure what’s going on but it’s making me dislike this app. Please fix it Pandora or I’ll have to check out your competitors.
I enjoy using pandora! The station creation tools are awesome! I can create any type of listening material I need for all occasions. Tap pandora and let it play!!  I have it on all of my devices!! 
Love pandora!
Pause button is still broken and just keeps playing when connected to other devices. You have to quit the app to stop the music.
This is a really good app you can add as many as you 😜 I add a lot I just love listening to music you will too with app 😄😁
Each time I answer a call it won’t play again. I push pause and play nothing happens
I really like most everything about pandora, but I really hate the way the alarm system is set up. I’d like it a lot better if the screen could be turned off and or let the user go to any other app like any other alarm.
I’d really recommend this music app💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💸
Love it! Always great music!
🤨
Nothing but he Music I want
Lately has been causing my phone to shut down. Ads are increasing too.
Thank you for the days I fall to remind me God has me and will puck me up
With all due respect to the “masters” Sinatra, Bing, Nat, etc it is Refreshing to hear new versions of the “oldies”.
Love this app, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE add a permanent uninterrupted hour of listening button! I would be more than happy to watch a video add to avoid the audio ads, but it's so random! Adding this would make it perfect!
Part of me .I take Pandora with me everywhere!!!!!
Thanks for all the great music
Replays single songs playlists would be nice in standard pandora
Love it!
Pandora allows you a variety of music !! I truly enjoy them keeping track of the type of music I liked and making suggestions as well as allowing me to add to my playlist and start a new station etc.
PANDORA'S EXCELLENCE !! THE DYNAMIC MUSIC RESOURCE  AND DIVERSITY THAT IS READILY AVAILABLE IS WHAT MAKES IT"FANTABULES"   🌅                              I GIVE A SIX STAR RATING.  IF FIVE STARS IS THE STANDARD SCALE FOR REVIEW.                          I JUST AMENDED THE SIX  STAR     STANDARD TO ALLOW THE APPROPRIATE MERIT THAT "PANDORA" RIGHTFULLY  DESERVES.                                    SINCERELY  PLEASED IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA 
Pandora never disappoints!
I’m going to be a good night and be happy
Best 9.99$ subscription ever, can play music station of your liking saved to play when you do even if you don’t have network. As many skips as you need/want, lol. It’s just the best!!!
There are so many commercials with this past update 🙄 I love the wide range of music available though ❤️
The best app!!
I like pandora because it has been easy to use
Useless garbage
I use this app a lot and it’s really good but I can’t listen if my family is at the same time (due to us having a joined account)
Seems like automatic linkage and connectivity has degenerated in past few months. About to call it quits with Pandora - January 1 may be time for new music resolution...
You can be listening to a son and it will randomly fast forward, sometimes just one song, and other times until you close and restart the app, it’s really frustrating because I pay for this because I drive for Lyft and when a client requests a song and it won’t play or it fast forwards half way through it makes my clients upset  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I used to absolutely adore Pandora.  It was literally life-changing! I never used DVDs anymore or any other platform. Over the years I had diligently press thumbs up and thumbs down and it rewarded me with fabulous music. I can’t figure out the new platform at all. I have lost all of my old playlists and choices. We have tried so hard to get the old version but it seems you can’t go back. So now I have Spotify and I’m starting to use that  while I still try to figure out this crappy new version. 
One star is too many. I've been a long time subscriber but I have paid my last month. In the beginning it was great. Now there are too many problems to count, and features are being removed instead of added. Sad to see it go, but support is M. I. A. not even a response to my emails. After reading some of the other reviews I see I'm not alone. Don't waste your money
I love pandora so much I can listen to music whenever I want!!!!
Best advice give thumbs up and thumbs down to your song preferences to keep your pandora to your taste
Amazing
Been an annual paid subscriber for years but will not be renewing (up for renewal in a week) until they get moving on this. If I was a free version subscriber I wouldn’t complain but cmon dudes. It’s like you want people to dump you for Apple Music.  Update yer sheeeeeiiittt.
I love it!
I’m on the verge of deleting the app and my account. This service used to be quite nice but then they made it so that visual adds pop up for almost every song. If you go to close it, another usually arrises immediately. Sometimes I just want to enjoy the album cover....and not be advertised to the -ENTIRE- time I use the service. It makes me definitely not want to pay for it.
I love Pandora, but my off-line mode rarely works. It’s very frustrating.
Thanks for great music choice
Love it
I love Pandora.  I listen to it for soft music to sleep with at night, but when they cancel my subscription as my bank account runs low, the well-placed ads seem to queue right as in milliseconds from dream land
real real sweet baby...
I love the idea of music offline and how I can search any song I want but every since I subscribed to premium it cuts on whenever it wants I’ve tried force closing it and it still does it. I’ve been at work and hear my loud leisure music playing REALLY ANNOYING and EMBARRASSING  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Great music but so much adds and no skips /:
Good stuff
The best radio I could find on the web!!!......10 stars !!!
Best ever Wish premium price is lower .
I love reminiscing with pandora
Me gustaría que agregaran música de los dinámicos de Acapulco,por favor,pero de ahí todo bien.
Sabes; Escribe tu bendición de mes a mes en este año 2017. Aún pasando pruebas por la situación de la isla, siempre existe un motivo para dar ;GRACIAS DIOS! Tu familia, hijos, salud,hogar y porque tus experiencias alimentarán a las necesidades de otros y créeme que no serán necesariamente familiares, conocidos o amigos. Ah! Y la bendición tuya?... Está.

Best & only way to fly! Love the stations choices. If you don't have Pandora you are missing life! R Mags 
Easy to setup on my iPhone.  The sound quality on my small remote speaker is excellent! A happy camper. 
Why does it limit me on the #of songs when u fast forward?
It has a great selection of music
Really enjoy the format
when i’m driving or cooking i cannot always get to my phone in time to thumbs up or down. it would be great if there was a list of the last 10 or so songs that we can view and judge it. thanks!
Very noice music choice, wide variety of classics of every genre!
Love it ♥️
It’s so fun to be able to listen to whatever I’m in the mood for. I didn’t even realize until lately How many different choices there are.  When I’m driving a long distance I really enjoy the comedy stations.
I love it !!!!

You can like songs and create your own radio station.  It is like Siris XM radio without the big price. Love this app.
Too many adds, not everyone wants to spend money on apps.
Whenever I need a little flavor I add Pandora! 😉
I love Pandora... the commercials r not so bad... For them to give us free listening with options to dislike or like and then only get a few commercials about every 8 songs is well worth it to me... I’ve had Pandora for about 5-6 years and I love it now just as much as I did when I 1st got it!!! 💗💗💗
I would enjoy it more if there were less commercials.
Help can’t get an answer?? My iPhone 7 current iso Pandora comes on randomly. With app closed. Without me turning it on. Also it does not show up as an open app so I cannot even close it out.! So I must start iTunes music and it shuts off (or any other music or app that uses the speaker) What is really more odd is this time it turned on and started playing when I was out with the Cellular data  set to off and it stilled played . That points to a override?? I powered off I even uninstalled & reinstalled. Still dies it. A random times? I do love pandora sadly-  I love pandora music. I pay for no adds But get pounded every time I want to listen to it with a big cost upgrade. I have iTunes music if I want to play songs and Amazon. I want what I bought into  Pandora Radio?? 
Continuing to experience this app being nonresponsive on my Apple device. Play and Pause do not respond.  Randomly starts playing and have to launch app, then close.  Fix this or you will loose a longtime user. 
Love pandora
It will not let me delete account
I’ve used the app for a year now. It’s never been buggier.

Decent app, very repetitive, and almost as many commercials as music.
I’ve had the app for a very long time and always do the updates; but lately, it’s been staying frozen and not playing the music. I’ve basically had to restart the app multiple times to get it to work. Regardless if I’m on WiFi or not :( I’m uninstalling it and then reinstalling it to see if that fixes the issue.
Always just what I need.
I would give five star if I could pick two or more stations to play between
Love this app!
Best ever
I especially love the shuffle feature.
Pandora is amazing it lets you play music in the car and gam out to your own music you like and love
I really like Music everybody does but I love the most I listen to Pandora every single day in the morning lunchtime dinner even in the middle of the night and that's why I get the station five stars because it is the best and you're the best whoever made this.      LOVE THIS SONG
It’s ok, I get the feeling it doesn’t use as many calculations in deciding music as they would like you to think. And if the makers read this, stop sending me live music! I don’t want to hear music played at a concert and the number of times I’ve thumbs down live music alone hasn’t helped.
Best music app!
To many commercials on weekends.
I truly love pandora! Because of the stations I have play my favorite music! It's like a personal radio ! No disappointments here!!
I never purchase music. I listen to Pandora.
It’s so good❤️
Discovered a ton of new music here!
You can’t simply cancel this subscription. They have to make it near impossible to do so! Be warned this app likes to trap you, and doesn’t produce the “offline” versions it promises if you are out and can’t get signal or WiFi. Now I remember why I just buy music on ITunes!!!!!!
Have tried a lot of different music apps but always go back to Pandora. It’s the best.
Well pandora you lost a loyal listener this premium thing is just crazy if I wanted to pay to listen to music I’d pay for Apple Music but an add every other song? You got me messed up
There is a lot of interruptions, buffering
Music is the accumulated score of our lives. Pandora gives us continued choice and this helps us to create the best.  Don 
The only 'wish list' item is that it worked outside of the USA.... When we travel, we really miss Pandora!
Honestly, it doesn’t bother me that commercials are a part of this free service. My radio stations are so chock full of advertisements that I rarely hear any music...or news for that matter. (I have to listen to NPR if I want actual content.!) And you can’t beat the convenience of Pandora. Plug in a genre of music, and listen with no repeats. Love it!  Just wish they’d re-think the “are you still listening?” thing. Don’t like discovering in the middle of a party that the music has gone quiet!
I think pandora is helpful in some ways but the music that it provides is glorious
Honestly it is. If you give this app your feedback it gives you great results. If you love Neil Diamond and only what to listen to Neil Diamond  go buy a Neil Diamond CD. If you want to listen to music use Pandora, dial in your stations.
Y’all have so many ads that i think i accidentally clicked one and now i have pandora premium and i am not paying for something i don't want and i don’t know how to change it to the original one
La e usado por muchos años se a actualizado y ahora es mejor ,, no lo cambio por nada
Is so fun and is right what you need
Thank you pandora for the tunes. From old to new you know what I want to hear 😘
Pandora Best app ever .
Pandora is the reason I don’t have a music subscription
Lower rate like 5 or 10$ competition with Spotify
It’s good but not better than Spotify.
I just recently signed up for the free trial of the upgraded pandora and I loved it and plannned on continueing to use it but it has began to glitch, not play songs, skip over them, play a minute or even a few seconds and go to another song. And god the constant buffering. I had better luck using YouTube. It’s very glitchy and not worth my money I don’t think I would pay for this app. I wouldn’t recommend anybody pay for this app. It was nice while it lasted. Interesting how it will work just fine for the first week or two of using it then it just flunks out on you.
it's been really good so far. it usually lags on me but everything turns out fine. the only thing that bothers me is that when i'm on THUMBPRINT RADIO it plays songs that i didn't even like. Please fix this!!!!💕💕💕🔜😫🔜👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Because of Pandora, I have now been exposed to a vast culture of music that I never knew existed. I had a limited genre of music, but now I listen to many. I would even credit Pandora for helping get the best male dancer award at our annual Christmas party this year with over 150 people attending. Well, honestly, one other co-worker and I danced the “whole night” taking time to eat a delicious meal, then back to dancing. My wife doesn’t dance, but she told me to go ahead because she knew I wanted to. Enough about my dancing. But thanks Pandora for your excellent selection of music for all types of music lovers!!!
Jinnnjbjuunuiijkimkujueqjijusuupl n u nubb2 Yyz...&my      N.       J.     Not 
It was free music for many years supported by ads. Now you can’t listen without it stopping and reminding you to watch their ads or pay for subscription without notice. I’ll switch to some other music app.
Without this I REALLY don’t know where I would be. The stations I have created have helped me through some of the toughest of time and thanks to Pandora I’m in love
I updated the app and now it won’t work
Live Pandora just wish I had more skips or play a song that I type in. Other than that. Good stations and good songs
The fact that I can listen to the Christmas music of my youth means everything. The Latin Christmas music collection that Pandora offers is a Christmas gift.
I love Pandora it is the best.I totally recommend it.
Pandora’s web site advertises $9.99 a month, then tells you it must be signed up for on your mobile device (even when following links to sign up on the web page). Once logged on through your device your only option is to pay $12.99 a month (don’t bother searching for the advertised 60 day free trial, this isn’t Apple music it’s just a ruse). Nice marketing scam Pandora, one star is more gratuity than I’m willing to give.
Like pandora for most parts. Less commercials would be better
I just hope they keep pandora going love it alllll dayyyy it’s nice to pick what u like nice
Pandora is the shiz it knows just what I like and always seems to know my mood!Thanks
GOD knows I Love it always,Greatest hits everyday, everyone should listen to music everywhere. This is Great station everyone I know Love it
THIS APP IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED!!!!!😊
Love it
I love Pandora, I listen to it practically all day on weekends, in the car, and when I'm getting stuff done around the house. I have many , many stations because I'm eclectic. They've also introduced me to new artists. I'm a cheap person and so far I've been able to tolerate free Pandora with occasional commercials. If that's not your deal though you can stream Pandora commercial free for a small monthly fee.
4 stars only because of the commercials and the limit to skip songs.
Pretty good and worth the money. App gets pretty buggy when adding and deleting songs from a playlist. The delete animation jumps all over the screen if you delete more than a couple without backing out and going back in. Also if I delete a song from the playlist and then click the add similar button it shouldn’t put those back in. I’m trying to get a variety of songs that I like.
Full screen blocker style pop-ups asking for a further upgrade should offer “never prompt again” if you want not to irritate subscribers.  Some audio tracks are corrupted, sound quality is just ok, below Spotify or Apple Music. 
It has to much commercials and doesn't play the best music.😩
I looooooove it
Love love the selection ‼️‼️
Pandora rocks
This app gave me nothing but headaches. What's up with paying 5 dollars yet you can't even repeat or skip some songs due to license restrictions. And now it started restarting my phone and not wanting to play the first song until I skip to the second. Useless. Uninstalled!
Hey, as you can tell by my punctuation, I’m ‘over 50’. I just can’t believe how wonderful this world!
After my subscription ends in the coming month, I'm dumping them after YEARS of service.
Was my go to app for music. A few ads here and there, fine. But two ads back to back then one song and two more ads? I am literally listening to more ads than songs. Lost me as a listener.
❤️💘 all I’m goin to say
Cool
Megusta
Lo único que no me gustó fue que tiene muchos anuncios
Pandora is the best thing that's  happen to music since the compact disc. It allows the user to discover new music and rediscover some old favorites. Great interface, artist bios, easy to use. Great business model as well. In my opinion, better than all the other music streaming services. ☮️&💟
I love pandora and I use it daily, but lately I have been hating it. The music has been automatically stopping when I get a notification of any kind. It’s getting really irritating please fix this. Thank you.
Best thing since sliced bread
All pandora does is play the music you listen to and occasionally ads pop up or a ad for Pandora plus but overall it’s a good app
About once a day, Pandora will cause my phone to crash and I'll have to unlock my phone and reopen Pandora and whatever other app I may have been in.
Would be great if the app didn’t crash my phone all the time
pandora A.I. , uoeno, this one
Best music app ever 👍👍👍👍👍👍
Excellent music app
Need to play more newer music too.
Pandora offers a wonderful selection of Christmas songs sung by various old crooners ! Wouldn’t be Christmas without it!!
Ok
I recently pay for a subscription and I disappointed in how the app works , constantly the app crashes , if you disconnect your bluetooth the app freezes and can not play or pause the music an still playing, so I need to close the app and open again every time
Excellent Pandora you set the tone to mood! Keep that Dream Alive.
I consistently have to take my phone out and start Pandora when I’m in my car because it just locks up while using Apple CarPlay wirelessly. Which completely defeats the purpose of having an CarPlay for a safer experience. Please fix!
I use to like pandora but now I still like but sense the new update the whole system pandora they change it and I don’t really like it ,really changed like how to use and to get to station dats what I don,t really like about the update so pls change it how use to be once you change to the original I give you 5 stars or 10 if I could.
Why cant we just skip the Commercials that we don’t care about!?.
Its really cool and i love it
There are some serious bugs in this app. Every time I use it I have to force restart it at least once. It’ll stop playing in the middle of a song. I always have to reconnect Bluetooth. Get your life together Pandora.
I have always loved the Pandora app, but it’s been over a month and there still isn’t an update for the iPhone X’s screen! Please update this soon!
Pandora is great, especially during holidays
I think pandora is the best app on earth because I just have to pick the station I want and then let it be for the rest of the time I want music
Pandora offers the best choices!
I love this app
To many commercials
I love pandora!!!
Love the app! Premium is great too! I was wondering when support for the iPhone X will be added?
Thanks for this amazing app and hope it keeps getting better !!
Very problematic crashes out of no where when running on car stereo
The stations themselves are great and I wouldn’t mind the ads, but they are quite blaring and startling to my infant, even when the volume is low and especially when my baby is sleeping. It wakes or startles him every time, which is unfortunate because besides that, it is perfect getting and keeping him asleep. I understand why the ads are loud, but the way they are integrated is not infant-friendly.
I love it sooo much❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love it!
It’s great to have Pandora anytime and all the time, instead of Radio sometimes, to truly bring in the Christmas Season, not just a day, with the great Christmas Songs past and present for my family to enjoy! Thank you Pandora!!!
No den tantos anuncios. Pero me encanta Pandora
Thank you I love it 😍😍😍😍
Wish there was a option to select studio recordings only ! Live recordings often are of lower recording quality. But on occasion there are recordings on live events that I have never heard
After the latest update I cannot listen to my music using my phone data
Songs keep cutting out
Me gustaría poder descargar las canciones!!
Me encanta
This latest update that fills the screen with the song playing is just annoying.  I like to switch between stations sometimes and used to just scroll on the left side to find a station.  Now I have to exit the full-screen song page to get back to the page with the artists. Just seems like a totally unnecessary “improvement” 
Has all the music i love. Let's me explore other genres as well.
I truly appreciate the easiness of usage & the ability to set up “favorite channels” for type of music I prefer to listen to !!!
Way too many commercials.  Abusive
So easy and  goes everywhere.
One of the best stations around
I love Pandora....can’t wait to make a playlist...u guys make listening to hits fun @ easy
But where is the iPhone X update? Makes the app feel old.
Should let us use it without WiFi while listening to radios like normal without having to pay!
I love pandora such abroad and nice selections for music
There are way too many ads for me to enjoy my music. It also will not stay on topic. If I want to listen to Katy perry than I would create a station for Katy Perry’s music. So stop trying to play her on my Halsey music station.
Try it, you’ll be hooked like I did.
Music that I love listening to anytime I need to hear real music 🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶at my fingertip yes a lot of old school 👄💋😍♥️
Excellent choices come up for the genres I like, when I want to heat my favorite music, I turn on Pandora!
A few difficulties playing music when im not in the app, but updating my phone software seemed to have helped
Every time I get back in car I need to force close the app for it to restart playback
thanks for playin my fave songs
Please if you read this developers, please take that “still listening” thing away I believe it is very annoying, and redundant, I mean honestly, idc having to listen to ads, but at least take that reminder away.
Its great because it picks songs you like and if you don’t like it it wont show it again the only thing the bothers me are the adds but you can buy add free pretty cheap and they have other great offers too it also has a station which picks all the songs you have liked and you can hear them all without hearing others songs you don’t like. So in conclusion if you are considering getting this app you definitely should. 😄
Best app ever! Get ad free for only $10 a month I believe such an awesome deal! Totally recommend you download this app!
Really enjoying it variety is right on spot for me
I’m wrapping presents and listening to classical Christmas music. I am totally enjoying it!
I love this app I been using pandora since 2010 it’s the best
Love this app!! Has music for all my moods!!
Awesome really enjoy it
Ahhh I love Pandora!!!
What’s with all the commercials on Pandora? Every time a song is done playing 2 or z3 commercials play then the next song plays why? Now I can’t even change my password? Why is pandora playing games trying to make me mad? It’s working 
Not even playin ^
I’ve found almost all my favorite songs on Pandora, and it was all for free. For “radio”, there are hardly any ads, and it takes very little data. Pandora is my greatest musical discovery.
Excelent
Enjoying my tunes
Pandora is still one of my top three music apps, but I have a really hard time with application developers who take away features that were present in previous versions. The most recent example is they’ve taken away the ability to see which station a song was selected from when playing Shuffle.
It’s almost every other song sometimes
You thank you thank you so much this is a really great great app that I can also listen songs and I can just exit my phone to do. I love that stuff thank you so much and thank you
The app is great and has excellent music. The adds are constantly annoying, and it’s really concerning that an app this popular still has not updated their app to fit the iPhone X screen. The phone has been out for 3 months and still no change and that’s a huge bug for me.
Thanks for the great tunes ANYTIME ANYWAY!!!
Ok
I like it just kinda hate the adds other then that it has good music to listen to an all but it won’t let u listen to a certain song
Love the app and listen to it all the time.  Does not work well w Mazda integration constantly disconnects.  Works fine as Bluetooth but fails through the integration
I love this app you can get all your music
Pandora is so cool. It’s my go-to music APP for discovering new (to me) artists.
I have been looking for a music app forever that works and now I'm so happy.
Some ads are way too long
Keeps freezing up  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble. Please feel free to reach out to our support team directly for assistance: http://pdora.co/AppReview 
Always good music on
Realizing I don't have premium, I do tire rather easily listening to the same God Damned commercials over and over and over. I can't get to the volume button quickly enough. But, I do turn them all down as quickly as possible.
Doesn’t make something as simply as listening to your fav song more complex than it needs to be :)
The best $4.99 you’ll ever spend! No commercials and hundreds of songs that you love.
They play everything from the oldies to the new stuff , in a  great sequence  . Just what ur in the mood for
I work 15 hour days and I have Pandora playing all day and night. I love it!
One of the great things in life is listening to Pandora. Great mix of music. Easy to access.  Thank you.
TOO MANY ADS. The music and sound play is very well chosen and AMAZING. If it was an option I would put 6/10,but unfortunately it is not. It is a great app just the ads problem.
More skips
There is no other music I would rather but Pandora my first love in music when iPhone was new thing back... I love it then n I still do
I hate them. But I just want to enjoy my music. Plus I’d like to skip more, I mean really.
❤️listening with ❤️❤️❤️❤️vibes smoothing out my day
Once I found Pandora - I am able to hear a Rainbow of different moods of fantastic music - Total Awesomeness -
Pandora is so easy to use and versatile! I really enjoy using it.
Unable to unpause songs. Need to close app and relaunch. This happens from a manual pause or automatic pause like a phone call coming in.
Pandora is my FAVORITE! ❤️❤️😫😫
Pretty cool and easy to use I highly recommend this app
I like the fact you can like and dislike songs, but I gags you have to pay to actually personalize the songs you want.
Always has trouble playing when switching from car to AirPods and vice versus. Wifi\\LTE. I am a paid member.  Uh it doesn’t stop playing after I leave my car and continues playing on my phones speakers  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry to hear that - mind reaching out to our support team so they can investigate?

I understand needing to show ads but they are all so annoying. Why the sound effects
Always put me in a good mood when I’m feeling down Great music shuffle
Unable to press play button.
Overall app is good when it works. Yes I’m using latest iOS 11.2.1. The pandora app no longer auto starts like iTunes or Sirius when getting into vehicle. In fact even after opening app it appears to be playing but no sound is heard. Have to close the app, wait a few seconds then open again. Sometimes this works sometimes it has to be closed and reopened again. Sometimes phone shut off and turned back on. I’m tired of deleting app every few days. Was paying for app til the problems started. Not paying for app that fails to work on my very short commute to work.
I like how I can get a variety of didn’t music!
This app Is amazing and I love it so much!!
The app keeps closing while in play, there are no current updates for the app either so why does it close on me?
Great
Es la mejor del mundo..
It’s crashing too much these last 4 recent updates. What’s going on?
I have the best time with this app with listening to my favorite music
Free, fast and fun! I listen to all kinds of stations I can save. They have everything from classical to country to rap! An occasional 20 second ad pops up but it isn’t annoying or disruptive. Amazing!
Garbage ads
A perfect source for new music that matches my favorite acts!
Love Pandora!
I pay for this app and there are still advertisements.  Either take out the advertisements or don’t charge for the app.  Then you get five stars.
Exelente.. estoy satisfecha sonvincreibles..!!
I’ve have Pandora for over 10 years now, and within the last 12 months, the app has become completely unusable. I have continuous hick ups, delays, non-functioning, and latency issues.   I’m extremely disappointed that this app has turned for the worse, as I am now considering using Spotify.  Dear Pandora coders and programmers, please test your app, and become better at releasing your apps, because you’ve destroyed a great product
Pandora usually has great design and embraces new design standards. I’m really surprised they haven’t adopted the new display on the iPhone X.
An ad popped up as I was making a selection and signed me up for the free trial.  I cannot find out how to unsubscribe.  Pandora says “unsubscribe in the App Store,” but I haven’t been able to find it at all. It’s very disappointing  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble!

I pay for my pandora service so when it starts acting up it’s very disappointing. Can’t pause or skip or even see the song title/artist from the lock screen anymore. Pandora is almost useless to me without this feature. About to cancel my subscription.
Best I have run across in 79 years   JOHN Lowery USMC Ret SgtMaj 
I love Pandora!!!!!
Nice
I love when I can play my music
Thanks
Gracias
Pandora is constant shutting down my phone. I first thought that it was my iPhone 7 Plus acting up but it only did it while Pandora was open. Well then, I bought the iPhone X and it is still doing the exact same thing, the app starts glitching(won’t let me pause/play, skip, like, or even use my headphone buttons to play/pause or skip and then after so long my iPhone restarts to kill the app. Then the app starts working again. It gets really annoying because I can be in the middle of doing something and my iPhone reboots and whatever I was doing disappears.
Love the music love the options I wish I didn’t have to pay for premium I think that’s a bit ridiculous when you can still listen to the exact same music for free yes you get more options but you can give those options out for free as well you make more than enough money on advertising that’s all otherwise it’s a great music platform
Love the app. Keeps me going during runs and in the gym.
Great way to keep you entertained, love it
Wish it had less adds but other then that it is great
Upset at the fact that I pay $14.00 a month and I cannot even manage to get a thumbprint radio on pandora premium. Some of the songs that I like will not even let me play them from my playlist because it’s only available on “radio”  I don’t understand why they left out some of the convenient  things about the regular pandora. Also, sometimes it does not let me skip unlimitedly/as I please.  Other than that I have always chose pandora over any other music app through out my smart phone evolution, because I enjoy the way it is set up like a radio and I am familiar with it. I also love the fact that I can go in offline mode. 
I go on the app, go to settings and then to subscription and all it says is “Manage your subscription on the Pandora website.” And so I go to their said website, log in and all that pops up is a window that says “Start listening” and once you click on it, it takes you to the App Store. I don’t want to keep paying $10 when I pay the same amount for iTunes already. If someone could help me cancel it before I get charged, AGAIN, that would be great.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble.

I have unsubscribed to the Pandora plus twice and I am still getting charged. Please fix this!!!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble!

First streaming music app I downloaded. Won’t download anything else.  Why? Pandora works every time. 
Love it has all of my favorite options, especially violin radio my fave
Now it's even more riddled with ads than radio. Then keeps pushing you to buy premium with that stupid ad that makes Pandora sound so full of themselves, would recommend Spotify instead
Play pause function only works for a few minutes after uninstalling and reinstalling app. Will not play upon start unless you skip the first song. Have to force close app the get it to stop playing. App causes phone to crash and restart randomly nothing has changed in 4 updates except that things have gotten worse. The non functional pause button was a gift from the last update
Love the app. Everything is pretty awesome besides limitations based upon ads and no subscription
Recently all my app does is buffer so I switched to Apple Music and find myself happier with the speed but I still miss the diversity that came with pandora.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’ve been experiencing recently.

I’ve been using pandora for years because of its wonderful algorithm and music selection, I haven’t paid for a subscription because I just deal with the advertisements by turning the volume off. Until today, when it would not let me turn the volume off for a T-Mobile ad. I’m sorry but that’s completely un-acceptable and I will refuse to use this app anymore because of it.  May this be the deciding factor of your decision to download or not. I feel that I have to express my opinion Incase someone else feels the same way.

So annoying I have to open the app twice to get the music to play
Post iOS update, doesn’t connect via Bluetooth to my car automatically after a phone call, constantly buffering, won’t resume playing when I press play. Expect better quality than this
I love that I decide on what type of music I want to listen
Ever since I got the iPhone X it keeps freezing and you cannot force close apps to restart! Major pain
It might be worth paying for but it’s still to expensive. Free version has way too many commercials.
After I open the app, why do I have to change stations in order for it to play anything? Literally won't play the current station when opened. It's so annoying.
Thanks
Since the last few updates about two months back, the mobile app is almost useless. I can’t pause the music, in or out of the app unless I force close the app. Sometimes I am able to pause the track, but then if I try to play it again, I have to close the app and reopen it to listen to what I clearly see is paused. May continue to use the browser version, just not paid.
I live pandora for its variety of new and old... aNd all the mixes
🔥🔥
It helps me get through my hard workouts
🤗 very good app
Excellent
Complete garbage since the the latest IOS update. Every time I connect to a Bluetooth such as my Kenwood in my truck, my older speaker and my brand new one, and my skull candy’s over the ear headset I have to restart the app up to 5 times. On top of that just about every time I’m on a Bluetooth device my phone will randomly reboot (sort of) and then I have to reboot the app afterwards and then starts right back at the beginning of the track that had just ended or right at the end. I thought I had found a way around restarting the app by just switching stations but then found that I no longer had control of the app ( such as >\\=, skip or even volume) from the Bluetooth device or even the phone itself.   I’ve used pandora for many years and right now I’m about ready to look for another music listening provider.  Update: they have done 3 updates sense I posted this that all say “bug fixes” and “improved listing experience” it it’s still doing the same thing 
App doesn’t respond to Bluetooth inputs from time to time, either car or head set. Continues to play in my pocket after exiting the car. No iPhone X support.  For a monthly subscription you’d think this trivial stuff wouldn’t be an issue. Would give it zero stars if it would let me.
oMG LUV DIs ApP 🔥🔥🔥💙💙💙😍😍
You can choose different genres
Best music app ever! Just pick your favorite station and jam!
Pandora never misses a beat especially when you can create your own stations formatted to the artist.
I understand the necessity of commercials, but y’all have way too many. And you seem very pushy about getting a review... keep up with the great music choices and thank you very much for your services. I have turned many people onto Pandora and will continue to do so. I think you will continue to get good ratings, but if you really want to bolster your profits, offer more free trials of commercial free radio without the necessity of a credit card. I guarantee your profits  will climb out of site. Thanks again
It needs to fix that
Never a disappointment as a matter what you’re listening to Pandora got it all covered thanks so much .!l Bobby.
It seems like there is more and more ads and more often. The songs come over and over. No new songs in the same genre are introduced.
The app always used to launch automatically through Bluetooth whenever I got in my car which I loved. Since recent updates it never connects, and is constantly freezing and crashing. I am always having to close the app and reboot it just to get it to work. If I pay for something monthly I expect it to work. Seemed to work better when I was getting the free ad filled version.
Big Pandora fan here. I do wish they would play the radio version of all my fav songs instead of "live" versions. Still a big fan. 5 STARS!!!
ALL I GET IS BUGS! I probably close and restart this app about 8 times a day. God forbid I pause the music for any more than about five minutes because if I do I’m manually doing what the app is supposed to do on its own.   Oh, and I’m absolutely ecstatic about the huge crash I experienced while I was driving. That was fun! I got to drive home sans Pandora and then start a whole new account because the one I was listening to simply... VANISHED! Thanks a lot. Apple Music is becoming more and more appealing.   Oh, and stop asking me to upgrade. I’ll come to you if I need anything in addition to what I already have.   You’re on thin effing ice, Pandora. 
I’ve been listening to Pandora for a few years now and I would not have my listening pleasure any other wayKeep up the good work Pandora
Takes you back to real music and unforgettable memories.Thank you
Buena aplicación me gusta mucho
To many adds.

Too many ads!
The Christmas music selection is GREAT- brings back lots of memories
The app crashes to much. I constantly have to kill the app just get my music to play again.
Pandora- hire me. I know you're in trouble, but I love this app. I've been paying for it for 5 years, never been happier. I have ideas on how to make it better that will change the world! Cue reply from Westergren! Sync it up on all my devices, car Xbox, iphone, iPad, Mac& iPod. Literally everything. Everyone is always so impressed when I put it on and there are no commercials. A must have, love the app. Seriously tho, I have innovation ideas that will increase growth. I want user profiles similar to Netflix model. This is my go to for music.
I have been using this for a long time now. Love my stations. But need more variety and access to more music. Also. Price for premium is too high for the lack of library.
I love this app I listen to it every day it awsome
I love this freaking love this app and song!!!😃😃
Dope as the pope
Love Pandora! Great algorithms, they always know what I like! Plus, the suggestions are really good, too.
No matter what your mood is you can find it here from back when you were a teen thru today you can find anything even from your grandparents time
Ever since the last update my pandora screws up. The pause button doesn’t work on the pandora app and on my locked screen. I pay the $5 a month for pandora plus or whatever it’s called which usually works just fine except when I try to use it on other devices. I’ve signed in to my pandora from my Xbox but I don’t have the unlimited skips I’m supposed to have. That’s the whole reason I bought it. Please fix these issues bc I honestly love pandora. Just not right now. :/
Love pandora
It is grate to have fun with the music thanks for making this for us
Great app
I love pandora
Currently buggy and not formatted for the iPhone X.
Jorden squad is cool
Really good
Wish there was a sensory option
Really like listening to pandora because it plays my favorite songs that I can jam to in the car and also I can switch it up from different stations when I'm in a different mood.
Purchased a Honda 2017. Within a month of apples crazy updates I am not able to use Pandora. Honda blames Apple and visa versa. Idk what to do anymore. Is pandora too?
Greatest music app ever
Really enjoy listening to the variety of music pandora offers! Great music provider!
I love this app! Even though i also have another music subscription, i still use Pandora everyday! No other service chooses similar music to your favorite artist like Pandora.
Initially it is an excellent service until you decide not to upgrade, then they automatically pause your service in the middle of songs..... not cool at all!!!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing!

I have it in shuffle and it keeps going to instrumental music and I keep hitting the thumbs down button but every two songs it plays again. I had pandora before and never had this problem. I decided to download it again and that's practically all I get is instrumental. I thought it would remember my likes and dislikes.
I pay for premium and the songs most of the time don’t load. I put together playlists and when I select a song it’ll highlight then run through the entire list and quit. Uh I’m not gonna pay for this much longer if it’s not fixed.
Has a great variety of music to listen to, a bunch a great artists too👍🏼
Need to get rid of advertisements
Not compatible with iPhone x
I love pandora but recently it has been crashing a lot. It’s annoying when it’s playing in my car or at home and it suddenly shuts off. I hope there’s an update soon.
Have to constantly force quit this app to get it to do anything.  Enter an area of weak coverage? Pandora freezes on “Cannot connect to network”, never recovers or refreshes when connectivity is back. Open the app to listen to music? Pressing the play button doesn’t work. Skip song button sometimes works. Listening to Pandora in the car, and shut off the car? Pandora keeps playing in the background, and the pause button does not work. Song keeps playing forever.   It didn’t work right on my iPhone 6S and it still doesn’t work right on an iPhone X. Nothing about this app works right anymore. 
Please update to support iPhoneX and it’s new technologies that work with iPhoneX OLED display.
They just totally know what direction my likes mean so the music is bomb!
No! Just no, had zero control over station. Wife is now mad because I couldn’t keep banjo off her stations.

I hate the new layout, so much easier to navigate before.
I’ve been looking for other  music apps like Spotify and iheart radio but to tell the truth they aren’t that good.until I found out of Pandora it’s really good lets me repeat songs over and over with out having to pay for anything unlike I heart radio and it gives me me plenty of skips unlike other music apps. I hope some one reads my review and agrees with me.
I love pandora! All the stations are amazing . Love hearing it in my my 2018 BMW makes it more fun cause it sync with car play and I don’t have to look at my phone at all.. great quality of songs recommend this app for all kind of music.
So I really feel your algorithm is very inconsistent in terms of the type of music that comes up when you pick a band for a station.  And on top of that, as a fan of the band you pick you barely play the earlier recordings of the artist which is the bulk of the fan favorites, at least for me.
The best place to listen to music
Pandora is my favorite music app because of the explicit lyric filter. Thank you.
I use this app every time I get in my car! I love that I can get a better sound quality and also moewvariety then the radio provides.
Turned on pandora and went from a 37% charge to 2% charge in 2 and half songs!!

One of the best music apps helps a lot but not liking the adds between music
It has a great assortment of music, however I do not like the fact that you have to pay to listen to it offline...
I love everything about pandora you guys are amazing I have no complaints👍
These last few updates haven’t fixed the bugs on my account. I have a paid account but I can’t pause or start music it’s bad.
Legendary
I’m in the same boat as SuziQ86. Just opening the app is the beginning of my troubles. I can’t pause or skip unless I force quit the app a few times. Can’t do either in the lock screen over 90% of the time. Bluetooth on speaker or car isn’t any better. Sometimes the app will start playing in my car even if app isn’t open. When I get out of the car, sound shifts to my phone. Can’t pause it in lock screen so have to open app then kill it in order to stop music. Thinking about switching to Spotify.
I don't want to have to pay cause I ran out of skips
'Nuff said!
I love pandora sooooo much and listen 24/7  but I wish you had unlimited likes and disklikes so you aren't forced to listen to a song you don't like
Still no update for the iPhone X? Tired of seeing these black bars. Please try to get an update out asap
I have all the music I need!!!
Awesome Christmas music
LOVE MY PANDORA. ...  IT VERY ENTERTAINING ...  THE MUSIC SELECTION IS AWESOME !!!
Pandora has awesome playlists that never disappoint!
Its amazing
I love Pandora!!! It’s definitely my favorite app on my phone. I’m able to add any artist I like into my list. And I’m able to see what songs I like. Even if my Pandora is on shuffle it always seams to know which songs to play.music is life!
It gets me the oldies I grew up with from the 1950’s and 60’s. Replaced a lot of my CD collection.
Absolutely changed my life. This great app as opened my ears to the absolute godsend of music. While I am most definitely NOT going to pay for premium, I can still enjoy my music. I only have one complaint: when listening for 1 to 1 and a half hours, you start getting no songs you like, and songs totally unrelated to the radio. For example, on my Image Dragons radio, I started getting love song. Really?!
Thank u
Every ten minutes or so the app completely restarts my phone, this is a huge pain! Definitely prefer Spotify or SoundCloud to this app
Here lately Pandora turns off mid song it’s annoying
Great and easy to use!
I love pandora so much I use it for almost about everything when I’m doing homework, at school, car rides, to me it’s a great app and I will always and forever use it. I love that you can create your own stations and also chose stations/music. I will give it a five star every time !!!!
The app still crashes my phone! Do not suggest using if you are driving.  Previous version review:  Before this version, I used this app daily. Now, after listening to four or five songs, the app quits, and makes my phone reboot! This is unacceptable from a music app. It does it by itself, and seems to be triggered by Snapchat and other apps as well. This is very dangerous for anyone using it while driving with a GPS. I do not suggest using this application until it is updated and this problem is fixed. 
It’s a great app but has a little bug where when you close the app music is still playing
They don't even mix it up between the same artist on their own station. If I pick Prince, I don't want to hear all Michal Jackson, and I don't even have a Michael Jackson station. This goes for all stations.
It’s like it reads my mind, always knows the song I want to hear. Or it even keeps the tempo and plays the exact style of music I want to hear
I like the app, but it doesn't cover the entire screen.
This is a great app it’s been here forever and it deserves a $999999999999999999999999999 tip
I canceled my subscription a day before the free trial ended and I was still charged 14 dollars. I love using pandora but I wasn’t quite ready to pay for premium yet, but I was still charged
Fan for life. No commercials and my choices for the music, oh yes please!!  Have used Pandora at home, office and on the road. My favorite streaming service. 
Love these two stations on Pandora
This used to be my favorite music streaming app. However, since the iOS 11 update it has become nearly useless. I have to open the app 2x ever time I want to listen to music. Freezes the first time every single time it’s opened, then works on the second try. It also used to resume from the previous spot when paused or when I turn off my car when I’m connected to Bluetooth. No longer does this happen. I now also have to open it 2x every time I pause my music too. Garbage!!!!
I love music and Pandora is the best and the easiest way to hear the greatest songs on any playlist
Enjoying the CHRISTmas season with these tunes P! Thanks:)
I have plenty of apps already updated to the new iPhone X design. Pandora being a top 10 app download is way behind.
It’s goes back and forth between amazing and super sucky
Gone from rap to K-Pop to metal. No matter your mood it seems to have it.
Great playlists
I Like This app but everytime I try to play a some it stops the song and plays a ad or turns my phone off everytime I open the app
Ads play in Spanish. I speak English
Love this so easy to navigate and a go to for all music when I am happy it pumps me when I am lonely it is comfory
I been having problem with the whole pandora app crashing so many time i try so many ways but the problem still same i delete the app twice,sign out and sign in....an more probably anubody can help me with.
Thank you so much fore putting all my favorite songs for no cost!
I use to listen to Pandora all day at work and for some reason now when I try to listen after a few songs it’ll restart my phone. I don’t have this problem with any other apps.
I have been using Pandora Plus the day the released it a while ago, never had an issue until I upgraded to the iPhone X...now pandora doesn’t work well at all, constantly freezing, can’t change songs from the lock screen anymore, doesn’t connect to car Bluetooth anymore, and in general doesn’t seem to have been changed in any way to accompany the new iPhone (screen size, lock screen, etc).
Have used Pandora for years and then switched to Apple Music for a bit and now returned to Pandora. It’s like I’m home again. It hasn’t made any drastic changes. It’s consistent; by that, it’s consistently great! They follow the golden rule of business: if it isn’t broke then don’t fix it.   I love Pandora! 
Pandora used to be a great service. Over the last year or two, the amount of ads increased so you now get them pretty frequently, which was a pain but if you wanted to use it a lot you could always get the paid version. The latest version seems designed with ads foremost, you have to click through some menus to get to the song that is playing. The ads that show while the songs play don't make the video ads any more spaced out though; you can expect about 1 ad per every 2 songs. I've been a fan of Pandora for a long time but this is too much
Love pandora listen to it all the time
I use Pandora to listen to a variety of music and enjoy being introduced to new tunes as well.
Too many annoying commercials
What is going on with this app as of late? I pay the monthly fee and yet the interface between Apple CarPlay and Pandora works less than 1/2 the time? You have secured a deal to be in many new cars yet the app fails! And to add insult to injury you want more money to upgrade! For what better uninterrupted services?? Get your act together with this app or going to commit to Spotify in the New Year!
Even after paying a monthly fee it still doesn’t let me skip as much as I would like and doesn’t play songs I like consistently.
Pandora plays all the music I love better than anything I’ve tried. But when y’all play 3 commercials back to back to back, I lose interest. I’m fine with playing one every couple of songs but please do not play one song followed by three 30 second long ads. I’m never going to pay for your station. Thanks😘
Great variety of music!!
I’ve been using Pandora for YEARS!  Loved it, upgraded to premium and loved it more. Then a few months ago they updated and it has NOT been working right since. Pause button sometimes works. The app pauses after my screen goes dark (it never use to).  I will have to hit replay when the app is open just to get it started back up.  Please fix this, I’m finding it difficult to pay for a second vice that works, maybe, half the time. 
I love it it is worth 5 stars
Update: App updates keep getting worse. Besides the lack of improvement on my prior criticisms this app has a new fault I HATE. I use the app connected to my car. If I shut my engine off and restart later and reconnect instead of the App playing from my last selected station it goes to SHUFFLE mode. Ugh. I want to put ci up where I left off!  Hint to Pandora - App updates for one area are useless if they break functionality in another.   Still sick of the loud ads and inconsistent volume. But why would I pay for a product when the provider breaks it and does not improve it?  Headed to Spotify.  >>>>> Used to like Pandora a lot. This year the number of ads has increased probably by 50%. Not only that, but a good portion of the time when you do get an ad there are two right in a row. Annoying!! Ads increase if you skip a track. Considering other options.   The other ANNOYANCE is their inability to equalize volume between tracks. All recordings are different, and that is why this is necessary. A quiet recording set to proper volume followed by one recorded at higher levels blasts you out of your seat.   AND OF COURSE, ALL ADS ARE SET TO BE LOUD LOUD LOUD.  I might\'ve be tempted to pay now that Pandora has a no-ads option at $4.99 /mo.  But not unless they improve the technology - audio levels and such. 
For the most part they find music that I like and I rarely use my skips or thumbs down
I love pandora! I listen to it everyday literally all day❤️
I Love Pandora because it lets me listen to what I want!!!🎉🎊
Great App especially when looking for new artists and different genres
I love ❤️ pandora it is the bomb
I second everything SuziQ86 said in her review. I pay monthly for Pandora and for years it’s worked great. Over the last month or so, however, it’s become the most frustrating app on my phone. I open it and it looks normal, but nothing happens and pushing play does nothing, so I have to close and restart every single time. Then it may or may not play a full song before it just randomly stops. It used to automatically start up and connect to my car’s Bluetooth when I got in the car, but now I have to go through this manual open-close-restart-hope process every time. It’s been over a month. The help page is useless. My phone is completely updated and none of my other apps have issues. Music from all other apps operate perfectly and connect seamlessly to my car’s Bluetooth. Fix it, Pandora, or I’m out.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I cannot see the lyrics on any of the songs! And the new features are just confusing! My stations are not playing properly, it\'s only playing 14 seconds of each song and I can\'t even hear anything and I know it\'s not my phone because the volume on other things on my phone is perfectly fine! I cannot navigate this new pandora and cannot listen to my stations because I can\'t hear it and it is only playing seconds of songs anyway! 12/20/17 2:25am! Please fix these problems now! I want to be able to use my pandora in a couple hours when I wake up! If it\'s not fixed by 10am I will delete it!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’ve been experiencing recently.

Need support for IPhone X. It’s been a month!
When I play a station by a certain artist I loved as a kid, it plays all the great music I used to listen to.  Takes me back to easier times or gets me excited and l pumped-up.  There’s a playlist for anything.
Good

Pandora is a wonderful app to use , but I wish they. Gave me pandora premium automatically
The iPhone X has been out for months and while nearly every other application developer has updated their app to support the new device, this application is still out of date and unoptimized for the iPhone X. Update your app already, this is ridiculous.
I’ve been a pandora one subscriber since it came out. After all these years I feel like their programmers have sabotaged the app. Is pandora a sellout now? Are they trying to get rid of all the subscribers that won’t purchase premium? I’ve been very patient with the current Bluetooth issues. What’s the deal? Let’s get it back to the way it supposed to be

No matter how often I update my phone or the app it randomly shuts down my entire phone and when I start the app I always have to listen to a different station than the one I was listening to when I closed the app. Otherwise no matter how many times I hit the play button, open, or close the app it won’t play music. Sometimes when I update the app it automatically puts all my stations on shuffle. The Spotify app doesn’t have any of these issues and I’ve had pandora for over 10 years but I’m using Spotify more and more. It’s unfortunate.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Awesome Awesome Awesome!!!
What I don’t like about Pandora is that you only get a few skips
Ever since I updated to the last version on the new iPhone 10, Pandora no longer auto-pauses music when connected to car Bluetooth. Instead, it resumes playing on the iPhone speaker and cannot be paused or turned off until you force close the app. New bug?
Añadir más canciones del artista escogido y retirar canciones que no van con el género escogido 👍
I literally can’t do my job without pandora.  It’s as important as air. HOUSE music pumps me up and makes me go bigger harder faster longer.  Thank you!
The app is so buggy, it’s gets stuck and needs to be restarted very often Also when are you guys gonna update for iPhone X full screen? Almost all other major apps have already 
After every song I get the same ad
Very buggy with iPhone X and latest update it is unusable. Pause doesn't work and music stops if you swipe away from app. Lots of other issues as well. Uninstalling and reinstalling the app fixed it. Temporary fix... I can't pause or play... Have to kill app to stop audio. After latest update... Pause play button is still broke... 
I thought I paid a monthly fee to avoid pop-ups, so why do I keep getting asked if I want to upgrade? Very annoying
More according to the artist
Needs to load quick and less crashes
I have been using pandora for well over 5 years it just started crashing about 4 months ago. I got the iPhone 8+ and it still crashes; idk whats going on it does it legit everyday too.
If I do not close pandora (app switcher), the next time I open it I cannot start music, controls do not respond. Must fully quit app then start again to regain use of controls
I love that I can pick and choose music that fits any mood or event..The only way I listen to music!! Pandora ~ you are amazing!!💜💜💜💜
Love it!
I hate the fact that I try listening to a station and I constantly hear the same songs over and over and over again, and the adds are overwhelming too.-. You guys should use Iheartradio! They actually try to avoid this type of stuff  All the good reviews are written by Pandora themselves.  Realized that every time I use Pandora my phone shuts off and then restarts again, at first I thought this was a phone glitch and went to Apple to fix it but they told me there wasn’t anything wrong. I now use an app only available for apple called Musi, it’s very convenient and lets you listen to any song you want coming straight from YouTube. Try it out if you can. 
Good Times! Great mixes with little guidance.
The app has been none stop crashing since the iphone update. I have updated my phone and the app whenever possible and I still keep having the same problem. Please fix and I will update my review accordingly.
Look, Pandora has been great a listening app for probably 10 years for me.  However, they recently added a function to their app which allows users to inadvertently subscribe to their Premium services.  During the last two weeks, Apple has charged my wife $13.90 TWICE for supposedly agreeing to a Pandora Premium subscription.  We certainly never agreed to that subscription, and boy was I surprised when I jumped on the app today (to listen to some nice Christmas music no less) and there was a 1-click acknowledgment on Pandora, ready to happily begin charging me for Pandora Premium.    Well, no thanks Pandora.  App deleted!  Just think how easily this charge could occur on a phone!  Especially with childeren who love to pick up devices and push buttons.  Shame on both Apple and Pandora for this cheap, point-of-sale trickery. 
I used to have this app but got frustrated with all the commercials. I understand it’s free and they have to make their money but it’s way worse than radio. Sometimes you get 2 songs before an add plays. If you push the next button or thumbs down forget it a commercial every time. Pandora used to be pretty good but it’s being deleted and never used again.
Every time I open the Pandora App, it takes me to a Facebook login screen, even though I’m already logged into Pandora. For people that don’t want everything connected and want to open the App and drive, bit to be distracted by their phones, I think that setting needs to be changed.
I’ve used pandora for many many years with little to no hick-ups. However, as of late this app is h.o.r.r.i.b.l.e..... between the constant freezing, broken pause button, random skips of song mid-play this has lead to nothing but frustration. Whatever pandora did a couple years back they need to bring it right on back to this version. Because this is simply horrible and will force people to find a diff service for music.
I get it!! I know I can have unlimited listening if I pay. You don’t have to tell me every single time I am on the app. It’s also annoying that I can’t “thumbs down” more than a couple in a row, unless I pay.  If it’s so customizable, than I should be able to decline and not listen to it. Seems to get more limited as time goes by.
Great
Volume during ads gets turned up... cut this sh!t out Pandora--it's a cheap and annoying move. I have the paid version of Spotify, and the ad volume reminds me to switch back to Spotify.
I love pandora but you guys have been the worst after all these upgrades music don’t play freezes and cut off restarts the whole song over please fix soon
Son una basura si uno paga es para no recibir anuncios entonces mejor para que pago si van a dar anuncios para ver anuncios veo la tele mejor. 😡😡😡
I have enjoyed Pandora for a while until now. For the past month or so, I have been getting pop ups to try their premium version and I kept clicking no. Until all of a sudden, It was requiring my apple id and changing my world. I haven’t been able to figure out how to undo it as it tells me to go the the app store to change it and I go there, inly to find nothing. I have tried several different ways to figure this out and I am close to deactivating the app because that might just be easier.

You have to take the time to mold your stations, but once you’ve done it, it’s guaranteed to always play something you want to hear.
Loving it
Pandora has been a joy in my life. I take my friend with me wherever I go. It’s an escape to a peaceful existence when things are in chaos around me. I pop in my earbuds & go off to my own world. Keep up the great work pandora. You are my Rx for life with a peace that music can provide no matter the mood.  Thank you/Merry Christmas 
I've previously subscribed to Pandora for 3 years or so, but I find myself using Pandora much less these days.  It seems that algorithms influence stations more than the music genome that you've spent so much time developing. I frequently hear songs that don't vibe well at all with the current station that I'm listening to.  I'm assuming this is bc I've liked said song previously on another station. Whatever happened to relying upon the Music Genome Project to create highly curated listening experiences?!  Also, streaming at a bitrate of 64 kbps makes for a very poor UX and listening experience. Most of your competition streams at a bitrate of 256-320 kpbs.  Finally, why are SO many songs missing album art? How hard is it to upload the correct album art?  As someone who is very discerning with regard to design & UI, I find it to be very odd that you have two separate designs. Why not have one beautiful, cohesive deign across the app? 
Simply amazing, use it everyday!
Thank you thank you for the Filipino station i dont feel so home sick now!!!
Every time I open the app it crashes randomly between song one and ten. Glitchy often.
Why am is premium not the same on iPad as it is on mobile? It’s a bit irritating that I can’t search songs on the iPad version like I can on mobile with premium.
It helps release stress and helps me go to sleep 😴
I love using Pandora as my primary source of music, but the app is glitchy. Crashes almost every time I use it. Frequently freezes and none of the buttons will work unless I close and reopen. Randomly skips in the middle of a song. Frustrating!

Too many commercials every 2 songs then a commercial and the same one over and over.

Put iPhone X display support and I’ll give you 5 stars. It’s embarrassing you still don’t have it.
Pandora has a really nice radio station collection, but the internet connection fails a lot unnecessarily.
Everything is fine but for some reason if I go into different apps while pandora is playing, it pauses the music. That’s the only annoying this.
Used to be the best app for music. I have been a member for at least 10 years. I stream to my car everyday via bluetooth and the application is horrible. It doesn\'t show artist or song, then won\'t skip or pause. I\'ll turn off my car and it will start playing from the phone, and still won\'t pause or skip. Needs to be force closed to stop playing music. It\'s a liability at the workplace and anywhere else you don\'t want everyone else to hear what you\'re listening to randomly. It does occasionally work alright as it should, but maybe 1 out of 10 times. As others have said, it just started adding songs from other stations into rotation, even if they are nothing a like. I can\'t believe I pay MONTHLY for an application that works this poorly. If you aren\'t a Pandora user, don\'t start...  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I don’t know what’s happened....sometimes I can’t get the app to start playing, sometimes I can’t get the app to stop playing.  I’m seriously thinking of deleting it and using Spotify and Amazon Music and I ❤️ Radio.
!!!!
Maybe you should fix the app before asking a paid subscriber to pay even more money for an unusable application. Paying $5 a month for an app that doesn’t work at all is over, you should refund everyone the last 3 months of which this hasn’t worked
As time goes on and with every update the algorithms seem to become worse at predicting what type of music I will enjoy. It is no longer tolerable to listen to.
Love this app!  Thx
Lately I noticed that there is no unlimited hour I mean come on! I love the app I just want an hour of unlimited back!
No complaints
I love Pandora. I just wish the UI would update already.
Helps me listen to a wide variety of music. I love that.
Good stuff
When music is playing on Bluetooth, sometimes the app will not respond until I skip the song
If you're thinking a premium subscription will be better than the free tier, think again. Pandora’s catalog is deficient, too many songs are only available for radio playback as part of a station, and the “premium” sound quality is on par with pre-digital terrestrial FM radio. Since Pandora purchased Rdio I had hoped their on demand service would be in the same league or, at the very least, in the ballpark but, sadly, it is not. Save your money. Pandora free with ads is a considerably better experience than a paid subscription.
Too many advertisements......not cool
Try not showing political propaganda commercials and I might download again but I doubt it.
I like to hear music all the time
I have always been a big advocate for pandora over other streaming platforms. The algorithms used to create playlists is far superior, HOWEVER, not being able to select specific songs to play has been a huge drawback.  I thought Pandora Premium would be the solution, but it has been about a year now and it still acts like an app that has just launched. Also with no desktop version and about 30% of the songs I want to play being unavailable due to their poor license agreements, I'm finally getting rid of my premium account and switching to a more inclusive service. 
U the bust music app in the world
Every ad is in Spanish even tho I don’t speak Spanish. I don’t have anything against them either so save it. My account is set to English as well. It’s annoying as f and I’m not upgrading just to avoid Spanish ads.
Pandora app has been crashing for over 2 months. It’s not an enjoyable experience to start listening only to have the app crash, re-open the app, allow it to play the same song it just crashed on again... please fix. Revert back to old code and slowly make your upgrades and fixes because you don’t have the ‘crash bug’ fixed yet as claimed..  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Since 2011 Pandora has had poor Airplay functionality. Still the same, the Airplay button is there, if I select Airplay I get 4 networks of which only one will play. The problem is once that network/Airplay device has been selected I can't select another one, or stop the selected one.   I have to believe Pandora is making money. Time to get your act together folks and fix the basics. 
Consistently unable to pause or stop music playing either in either app or control center. Have to force quit app to resolve.   Please fix, running latest iOS. Would like to keep paying for this service but may have to switch and pay someone else. Thanks 
Finally deleted this app. My stations are constantly getting deleted.Some stations i spent years tweaking and altering are all screwed up now because this app took away my likes and dislikes of so many songs. Also, this app always force closes after a cartoon amount of time which isn’t long at all. There’s way too many ads, this app was great when it was first released. Now I get extremely aggravated whenever I go on it. Switching to Spotify radio
They play most of the genre u request. On some days I’ll play nat King Cole then hear “pop lock and drop it.”

For some reason sometimes doesn’t work properly, it’s connected to my car and don’t play, it’s one of my favorite apps but now I’m not sure
Your app keeps crashing like it froze my entire phone this morning. Goddang a chick just wanna jam while getting ready for the dentist 🙄
Really good it's just I think you should play more songs from that artist
iPhone X optimization still not here. App has tendencies of shutting down after not using it in a while
Love pandora but has a lot of bugs still. Also would be nice if you updated for iPhone x.
Pandora is getting so frustrating to use. It won’t start up the first time i open the app. The play button doesn’t do anything. I have to open, close and open again. If I hit pause at any time, it does the same. The play button didn’t work and I have to lose and reopen the app multiple times. I have also thumbed down songs and I will get that song over and over even tho I have thumbed down all versions of it. I also notice that each station starts with the same songs. It does seem to just play certain songs over and over. I don’t get to hear new songs that match my interest. Yeah it’s free but it’s not worth the hustle.
I’ve been listening to this app since it was just a website.  Through the years I’ve been customizing stations, finding new music I’ve never heard and living my adventure called life, with pandora playing in the background the whole time.       Can’t think of what it was like before not trusting the people at pandora to help me find my way!                                                  thanks

What happened to the bookmarks? And not being able to listen to the samples of the thumbs ups unless you pay
I have been a user of the Pandora app for many years now and have never really had any complaints. But here recently, my app has started doing this thing where it will randomly shut off and pop up my lock screen asking me to open my phone. In order to get my music to play again, I have to close out the app completely and then reopen it (basically rebooting it). This happens very randomly and I have no idea what’s causing it, but it is very annoying!!!
I really like Pandora, but unfortunately when I open it on my iPhone X it shrinks it down. I’d really love it if it someone optimize it for the iPhone X so that we can have that beautiful display from edge to edge.
It’s good overall but there are so many ads!! Please come out with an update with not as many. I get it for getting more replays or skips but not just to listen to a song. Maybe this is what happens when I don’t use premium...
After a deleted my account and went to setting and deleted subscription... so sad Pandora became a scam
You guys use to be great now this last few updates have F@&$ up everything from opening the app and crashing every that’s open too this is too crazy! Get you $#!t together!
Fix your stupid bug that causes music to not play and for an ad to be paused and not playing, then everytime you click play it try’s to load another ad which then never plays so I have to close the app and restart it, happens like 5 times a day.......
Love it mane
Quality Over All
Any update for the iPhone X?
Great app fun
The best station! The shuffle option is so great! Thank you!!!
Simply the best:)
This app is pretty good until it decides to stop working and you have to delete I after you make a new account because it still does not want to work which is a little nerve racking but other then that it is good
I have been with Pandora since DAY 1. EVERYONE is trying to get my money, Spotify, amazon, google, but NO, I stick to Pandora. Then I even move from Free, to pay $4.99 and decided that i liked the Spotify ability when THEY gave me a free trial...CAME BACK to Pandora and signed up for the $9.99 (loyalty) and so far I have spent 2 hours trying to download, update and everything else I can find (signing in and out multiple times) and I still cant get it to work on my IPad. It tells me go to MY MUSIC and that isn't even to be seen on the app interface. COME ON! How much more is a girl to take? Im tired and I want music! NO Hassles,.,,
Good music.
💖 that I can listen to what ever style of music for every occasion and every mood.

Very much needed support for iPhone X and too many adds.

They have seriously messed this app up. Constant crashing, songs not playing, having to restart just to listen to songs, unresponsive buttons on app. See ya off to some other streaming app.
I love this app and the service, however the problem I occasionally encounter is sudden phone reset where everything stops, the screen goes blank, then the iOS waiting wheel kicks and while it reboots and then I have to unlock my phone again. This happens about every couple of weeks so it’s bearable but nevertheless a problem.  I always run the latest iOS and  I’ve tried reinstalling the app plus I’ve had several updates since this started.  I hope this can be resolved in the next update.
Really need to lay off the adds
Love Pandora!

Go to open pandora wanting to look at the update and it crash’s. It has never done this until I updated it. Plz fix pandora is like my life!
I don’t know if it’s the latest iOS or Pandora, but I find myself having to frequently restart the app after pausing and taking a short break. I can press play as many time as I’d like after my break but nothing will happen without restarting the app. I have been using Pandora since having an iPhone 4s and never had so many reliably issues before...
I’ve listed to Pandora for over 10 years now. I’ve had the app as long as I can remember. I love the service, however, in a recent app update I’ve found that it has started to glitch. I have a hard time getting music to play if I stop and switch between other apps. It’s disappointing that fundamental glitches would start in an app that is so widely downloaded and used.
In the past Pandora maybe played for about 3-4 hrs and it would shut off .. now it shuts off in less than 2 hrs... that ends my listening
It seems Pandora does not want the user to have control over their subscription. This is troubling because the company has means to accept payment yet no practical and user controlled means to change subscription settings. What is more frustrating than that is there is subscription management language in the app and online. But that language doesn’t correspond to anything the user is simple able to control. Even when attempting to delete my account I am being send e-mail options on how to do that.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I don’t know why but for some reason Pandora is playing one song when I open the app and stops after that... I’ve deleted the app several times and closed it out and re logged in and still nothing is happening!!! What do I do?? Should I just unsubscribe and stop paying for it or what??
When I open the app I have to completely change the station before the one I that I closed the app on will work
You can’t play songs without paying you can only make radio stations. You get more from the Iheart radio app. It’s a real scam. You can get free skips by watching ads or you can listen to music for awhile before you’re forced to watch an ad without a reward. It’s some real BS. Honestly I could play songs on YouTube so I don’t need this app.
Transcending Praises of All Glory & Honor unto Jesus here on Pandora!
I love pandora but I hate commercials that’s why I don’t watch tv or listen to the radio
My Phone never plays the songs whenever I open the app. I have to skip the song that was going to play because it froze. And even when I watch a video it’ll freeze again. fix this please. i deleted the app and won’t reinstall until they actually care
Good quality music
What happened to the bookmarks tab? Now it just has your stations (which you can access like 3 different ways already) and your “likes”.  I “like” a song so it will make my playlist better according to my liking. It doesn’t mean I want to bookmark it for later. You can still bookmark songs but there no where to access those. Need that back. 
I just got my iPad mini 4 today. I cannot see my playlists. I am paying for Pandora Premium. What the hell Pandora? I have avoided Spotify to try to make Pandora work but c’mon. Do better.

Very good !
For a couple of months I have experienced daily issues with this app (e.g. pause button doesn’t work, doesn’t work with Bluetooth, freezes in middle of song, skips songs, etc).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

The premium fee is a joke because you can’t have access to everything like your supposed to. Don’t waste your money.
It gets you threw adds u can replay over and over I had this for a weeks already and love 💗 it so much I’m not getting ITunes Pandora is better ages12+ only anyways I love it GET IT NOWWWW!!!!!💜💜💜💜💜
The app continually shuts down and when trying to access the app again I have to enter my pin to unlock my phone. The app shuts down and then the phone gives me the spinning thinking wheel. Happens after about 15 minutes of listening.
Might really enjoy once I figure out how to use it..
Strictly disappointed with Pandora.. this isn’t even a internet radio station anymore. Too much freezing up, not playing music when opening up the app, and more adds everyday I listen to Pandora. This is embarrassing and extremely annoying coming from someone that’s been using Pandora dice 2012.
Every time I load up my pandora. It lags horrible. Takes at least 3 minutes just to load up. I have an iPhone 6 with the newest iOS but no matter what pandora always seems to lag harder and harder every update. I’m actually deleting it because of this.
Love the music!
I’m in love with going on here and being able to listen to my favorite songs, on the go and at home or at another place, the best music is all right here🤩😉
Somehow I inadvertently chose a free trial, but never use Pandora so I didn’t notice they started stealing $12.00 a month from me for a service I’ve never used. Trying to cancel this robbery is incredibly hard to figure out. This is unethical at best. Ill never patronize these thieves again.
My iPhone is restarting when I use Pandora(either with more apps running or just Pandora); once I was just listening music on Pandora and my device suddenly restarted. It happens about one in three times that I use the app.
Frequently crashes my iPhone 7 when listening via lightning adapter & aux cord in the car.
Idk what it is but the app seems to glitch or bug out every month or two and will not open, of course this still happened after purchasing premium too 🤨
Both the iOS and Android versions do not work reliably with the Pandora app on a 2013 Honda Crosstour. We had the dealer reload the latest software on the car thinking it was just outdated, but it still doesn’t load half the time and when it does it is glitchy as all get out. The change stations setting doesn’t work, press pause and you are done - it just says disconnected until you switch audio input and close the app on your phone.   Here’s a bet for you: I’ll upgrade to premium for a year if Pandora will have one of their executives or product managers drive this car and use their own app daily for a week and tell me honestly that they are happy with how it works. 
Great music stations. Easy to customize.
Such a great service!
Its been getting worse and worse i don\'t know how many times I\'ve updated it and it still crashes. If you want ads why don\'t you put good ones in instead of that stupid shirt and tomato soup one and learn to get variety it always plays the same music. Used to be my favorite but really went downhill.👎🏽 still getting those crashed after the fifth time I updated it. Now its time to just delete the app. Not good.
I wish you could thumbs up or thumbs down songs right on the lock screen of my iPad. Currently, I have to do so by opening up the application and it hinders my ability to really customize my playlists because I am not always able to open up my iPad all the time.
Best music app today closest to Apple Music
Am i the only one constantly experiencing crashing? It’s beginning to crash after every 2 songs.
About a month ago the app started crashing and force restarting my iPhone. At this time I came use the app more than 15 on Wi-Fi before it unceremoniously turns off the phone.
i love pandora a lot! but currently it won't work. i open it and it freezes, nothing plays and nothing works. idk if anybody else is experiencing this problem, but i hope it gets fixed.
Not good anymore
I found my old music that I lost (my LPs and or cassettes)Great memories alive again!
LOVE. Especially with the upgraded version
This app is broken and has gone to hell with ads. Mainly the ones advertising pandora itself break the app
Still love this app!!
Very buggy and not optimized for iPhone X
My station jumped 3 times last night while I was listening to one station “not thumb print radio”!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I haven’t been able to pause this app for over a month. I’ve done all the updates and nothing. I can skip and do everything except pause. Unsubscribing now. Fix this issue!
I love this ration so much and i love Spotify ration station so much to !!!!!!!!!!!!😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇
4 iPad, please fix. App doesn't open to play. Even to see a selection. Nota, screen just goes bk to previous home screen .  It was 5*  I had to re download the app to wk correctly. All set! 
YAH
The updated version doesn’t have my bookmarks. I can bookmark music, but when I click on my profile there is no bookmarks. This what I have always used to buy music, now I can’t even see the list of songs I’ve bookmarked!
Excellent for the “free” option. Having issues with it shutting down after about 4-5 songs and restarting my phone. My husband wasn't having the issue as long as he was paying the monthly subscription fee, once he cancelled it the "shut down" began. Other than that excellent build of stations and very low effort.
Have gotten tons of use out of this app great music
I deleted this app because I couldn’t get rid of the red notification.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble! Please reach out to our support team directly for assistance with this: http://pdora.co/AppReview 
Very disappointed to hear an “impeach trump” our current conservative president ad during my music session.  Politics should never be advertised during this music time.   This is my time to relax and listen and enjoy music of my choice. I will stop listening to pandora because of this.
Used now and again Pandora is great for the Holidays and those times when radio just doesn't get!
Your app keeps crashing!! Fix it or I’ll shut the crap off.
Great music and can pick my verity!!! Plus add as many stations or artist I want!
More awesome
The last few weeks Pandora plays 2-3 songs and shuts down EVERY SINGLE TIME it starts up. Very frustrating
I’ve been a subscriber for many years, are you having connectivity problems? You are my go to music provider but logging into the app and waiting 5min for the music to start is unacceptable. Amazon music is instantaneous, so are I Heart Radio and Time-In etc do the problem is with you, I’d love an explanation or a solution.

Pandora has a glitch that cause my device to crash. The app did it with my iPhone 6+ and now it’s doing it with my iPhone 7.   I had to erase and set up my iPhone 6+ once already.   Please get this fixed. 
Shak a lak a
Hear a song what's next? Commercial. Skip a song oh what's that another commercial, if you let the commercial play by any chance app crashes and kicks you out. Goddamn worst then the radio tbh.
There way to many ads in one hour for me to enjoy my station. I get it's free but still
I’ve uninstalled/reinstalled the App several times. Fix it ASAP!!! This has been going on for months now!
I stopped using the app (about three weeks ago) because was crashing all the time, I saw a new update today 12/15/17 and I Thought you guys fixed the problem I been having, I did the update and I used it again, not even one song when it crashed AGAIN and the problem is not just crashing the app, it crashes every I have, all the apps I’m using! I deleted this one and I’m using iHeartRadio! So disappointed!
OMG love love Pandora! Great tunes --keep up the good work!!!
I used to have Pandora, but now it’s just being a jerk. So first, the ads. Every. Time. You skip, 2 ads play, then they go away then it plays music I don’t like at ALL. Then more ads. Now I have listened to 4 minutes of 2 minute ads. And the ads are just the same thing over and over again. That’s why nobody likes ads. It plays too much ads.   Now the music. YOU CANT EVEN PLAY ANY SONGS. The radios are crap. It always ALWAYS plays the same songs over and over and over again. The good songs are so rare, it’s like trying to find a 4 leaf clover. And you can’t play music for yourself. You have to listen to a radio that you don’t even like. It only lets you skip for like, 5 times.     Now the other problems. I log in into my google account for Pandora, then it logs in. But 3 seconds later, it logs me back out. Then I login again... same thing happens. All these updates are making this app worse. That’s why Spotify is SOOOOO much better. They give 30 minutes of ad free music. All you have to do is watch one video, then there! 30 min of ad free music, all yours. Spotify even lets you play your own songs. Just search it up and it’s there. And there’s only 1 13 second and then you get another 30 min of ad free music. And “Pandora gives you personalized music” is not true. It only plays whatever they put for you. And most of it isn’t what you would like. If you make a radio of your fave artist, it won’t even play what is made by that artist.  In conclusion, this app is crud (No offense Developer, don’t wanna make you sad) You just need to at least fix these problems, Developer.  But one more thing, Everybody else who agrees with me, I SUPER recommend Spotify! 
Phenomenal!!!
I have used pandora for about 8 years now and I have had no problems. I don’t like that it is so expensive for premium though. At least 5.99. I do like premium though. It’s nice to have no ads and unlimited skips.
I like pandora but one thing you should add is unlimited skips and rewinds to go back to the song
Great to listen great stations and love it
Tooooooo many ads
Pandora got all my good music on here
How about giving the iPhone X screen compatibility. Until then I’ll keep at 2 stars
The premium is frustrating. I get the same songs played over and over again often. I didn’t really have this problem before upgrading. The app has also been glitching so much more after I started paying for it.. it will skip through songs for several minutes before actually playing anything.
Constantly have to force close to get music to restart after pausing. Also the new update causes the music to stop when you open another app or go to the home screen.  Updated 12/15/17:  Still won’t play after pausing using the play button in the app or control center. I did delete the app and reinstalled after the update so that does nothing. 1⭐️  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

The last few updates have ruined the app! It never plays or it never stops! Fix the bugs, please! I rely on Pandora! I don\'t want to have to switch to a new app!
The update didnt fix anything i still cant pause the song
Change the skip system back the way it was.
I haven’t been on Pandora in awhile because of the phone I had. But now that I have a more upgraded, I’m finally able to get back on here. But anyway, I notice that the music keeps looping and playing over. It was like that before but not to this extent. Lil Wayne has over 1000 songs and I think I only heard less than 50 songs. In the past, it played over 100 songs. It’s kinda like pandora has downsized songs just to get a person to purchase the app
I luv pandora! It’s the best music app ever!!!!!!
This is my go to station when I want to hear comedy, unfortunately after the update it randomly cuts out, when it happens in the middle of a joke it is annoying.
Pandora is my favorite steaming app, but I’m over the constant crashing of the app. When it crashes, my entire phone restarts, so if I’m in the middle of something while using it, the work is lost.
Still no Landscape mode for the phones. Just iPad’s. Never mind you might have the phone mounted differently in your car or at home.
Pandora plays recommended songs that are similar to songs I already listen. Pandora also gives me a lot of skips and plays all the songs I have thumbs up 👍🏼 on. Pandora is getting to the point where it’s almost better than SPOTIFY!!!!!
Thanks for the variety of music you provide.  They are all great!
I love!!!!!!!!!!!!! Pandora
I subscribe to Pandora plus and use my radios Apple CarPlay functionality. Every time I launch the app from CarPlay it fails to start because pandora wants to sell me the premium subscription, which you cannot say no to with CarPlay.   It’s illegal where I live to hold a phone while driving so I can’t click the not now button, and just end up using a different music app.   I’m wondering why I pay $5 a month for service and get asked every time I open the app if I want to pay more for a service.   Stop upselling a refocus on making a quality experience for your users. 
Where are my bookmarked songs!?!? Update your app!
Amazing songs
Few months and a few updates later. Still no iPhone X support. Come on. I pay money for this app.
Love the app!! But nearly impossible to cancel a subscription I had a free trial tried to cancel before the date expired but then I see a charge of $10 omgosh not cool! Not happy and really not good business might have thought of resigning up if it were a better product to use!
Been a Pandora user for quite a while. Love it
Love the Heavenly Lullaby station. However, when trying to put a fussy baby to sleep and the music has finally helped them to doze of there is an artists add to like or get their music. I understand the need for adds but by purchasing your premium app it was to not have those station interruptions. I mostly use the app music for my baby daughter and love that I can somewhat personalize music she seems to enjoy. Happy Holidays to you all and thank you for all your hard work.
It's a great app and I love to use it but you must have a good wifi connection so I rate this app four stars
I have had it forever and still using it had a free account with limited advertising. I customize my stations and listen to what I want.
Can’t say be found the last five or six updates leading to improvements.  I’d rather endure commercials than to have paid for the glitchy “upgrades” and “improvements” these past couple of months....
Pretty terrible app
The app has been difficult to control since iOS11. Meaning there are times when music just won’t play until you skip the current song which is rarely desired. Or won’t stop despite hitting pause. Killing the app is required to stop the song.    And it constantly advertises Premium payment like I’m not already a Plus user giving them money for the service. 
I listened to my app once this month for about 20 minutes on WiFi but pandora is using up all the data on my plan this month! I never go over on my data and pandora used it all within 15 days! I’ve had this app on my phone for 2 years and never had any problems and for months I was using it continuously off WiFi with no problems. I don’t know what changed but I’ve deleted the app.
This app hates either the iPhone 7 or the 11.0 OS. I have reinstalled the app and still have problems.  Issues -quits/pauses randomly -makes the iPhone freeze up -won’t pause or won’t un-pause -won’t pause when I pull headphones out  It started happening when I moved to the phone without the headphone.   We’ll see if an OS update fixes things because the app update didn’t. 
This is the only app I use regularly without the iPhone X updated top and bottom borders. Forget “bug fixes” and focus on the visuals cause Spotify got it figured out a while ago.   Do or Die 
I love Pandora! It has every station that fits my mood! ☺️
Most of the reviews are fake. Pandora claims 7 ads an hour and this is a blatant lie. They constantly roll ads back to back so 7 is actually 14 not to mention they play ads on nearly every skip or station change. You can tell it's intentional to push for paid services. I'm so over Pandora. There are lots of better alternatives.
Everyone knows this app is good; so there’s my review.
I want some thing if you want to hear new songs you press a button and it plays new songs but when you trn it off you hear the songs that you like Plz 
Works great for me. Free !!!!!!  I’ve been using for years. I have several stations
Awesome!!!
Awesome
No better way to hear your favorites!
Looses Bluetooth connection after incoming calls.
Can we please get an update, and possibly a refresh. PLEASE!!!!
Why doesn’t Pandora have the capacity to use the whole screen on the iPhone X?
Latest update fixed nothing. I am still unable to connect Pandora to my car, like I had been doing for the past 2 yrs. so disappointed.
I personally find pandora is easier to use and more enjoyable than other apps. Like Spotify etc…
Great app
Too many commercials and same music on stations.
Fix it
I use Pandora on a regular basis. Sure there\'s ads but far less than on broadcast radio. A great selection of stations and songs. The app continues to crash on pretty much a daily basis. I’ve gone so far as to uninstall it and reinstall it. Makes difference. It’s a real pain when driving and seems to have something to do with the upgrade prompt popping up. It shuts down but when I restart it the app goes back to the song I was listening to.  Updated Pandora today 12/14 same problem
Pandora goes where I go.  Whether it’s work, errands, going to the gym, yard work, or cleaning house I can listen to whatever I want!
Still doesn’t support iPhone X or scrubbing from the lock screen/control center widget. It’s almost 2018– those should be changes already implemented if you want to maintain your relevance.
I have an I phone and every time I play pandora it will restart my phone! I have tried to delete and re install app but no luck!!!! So annoying!!!
Whoever is in charge of maintenance, fix it this BS.

I love pandora because it’s all I have ever used, but every time I play pandora through blue tooth in my car it restarts my phone. Every. Time. I wish this could be fixed
Pretty good if u like variety
I’m so lost!
Always on point.
I’ve been a faithful pandora listener for YEARS and this past couple of weeks my Pandora app won’t respond to pause. It won’t start playing once opened I have to skip a song to get it to play. It’s total crap!! Please fix or I’m deleting my account
After numerous attempts to listen to Pandora on my phone it keeps crashing. I’ve updated I don’t know how many times, rebooted my phone, etc and it still doesn’t work. Time to download iHeartRadio.
App crashes every time I use it. I’ve tried updating it. I’ve tried deleting and reinstalling. I’ve tried rebooting my phone and clearing all apps from cache.

This used to be my “go to app” for listening to music! I don’t know what they’ve done to it but it is awful now. It pauses my music several times during a song and I have to hit the play button to get it to resume. Sometimes it won’t even play at all when u hit the play button. Very unresponsive. I’ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it does not fix it. Very sad as this used to be my favorite app to use while driving and working out.

Please try uninstalling and reinstalling the app as this may resolve the issue you’re experiencing.   *Be aware that you will need to be running iOS 10 or higher to be able to reinstall the latest version of Pandora from the App Sto 
I use pandora almost every day and I am more disappointed by the day. The app just randomly crashes at least once a day and reboots. And with the iPhone X you have to occasionally close it down because the play button will not work.
I really enjoy the service. There could be less ads. The only real problem I have is sometimes it will play songs with the same lead singer back to back(i.e. Andrew McMahon and the wilderness, Cartel, and jacks mannequin) but it knows I like them so it's not a huge deal.
I updated this app one day and ever since then, it crashes all the time!!!  It’s the most frustrating feeling ever for this to crash right in the middle of an awesome song that you are really jamming to. I really want to pay for an uninterrupted version of the app, but there’s no way I’m going to pay for an app that crashes all the time. I keep updating this in hopes that one of these updates will finally fix this issue. I have perfect cell coverage and a new iPhone...please fix this and I’ll give it a 5 star rating again. 
I would ordinarily give it 5 stars because I absolutely love my stations and the customizing really works. I really feel like my stations know me. Pandora is all I listen to at home, at work, and I’m the car. Having said that, for the past few months, since some apparent update Pandora did, the app is unreliable, unpredictable, just stops playing sometimes, freezes, etc. It’s been very frustrating and it’s pretty much impossible to reach a human being at Pandora to help. So for that the 3 stars.
When I access lyric link, it doesn’t show at all...
This app would rule if it didn’t crash after every three songs. This has now been going on since the beginning of the year.
3 weeks ago it started resetting the bluetooth connection in my car every couple of minutes. Cannot even play one song. If I play the app through Bluetooth it doesn't crash but it messes up my cellphone connection. Sometimes takes the phone "off hook" and I cannot do anything with my audio unless I kill the pandora app. Tech support says they are "working on it" but nothing yet. (Update 6/2017) Several updates. Sometimes works.  Most of the time it doesn't. Still buggy as hell as far as working with my car app. Update 12/2017) got “tricked” into enabling the premium trial as it prompts for answers when it starts up in my car while driving. I thought I was clicking on “not now” but it was the “yes” button. Doesn’t matter as far as working in my car though. Still have to restart the app a half dozen times or more, when it does come up it does not remember my station and won’t play until I select it again. Almost always displays the previous song played on the car display. Can’t believe it’s been this long and it still works this bad with the car app. Would never pay for this! 
Seriously, 4 Ads and ONE song. So annoying.
Are both unbearable. Just use YouTube.
First thing I stopped listening to pandora for a few months because I was tired of the app hijacking the Bluetooth connection in my vehicle even when I had i books on. I had no option to stop this so I had to turn cellular off to stop this. So before it was a couple to a few songs before an ad. Now it’s one song then one to two ads. That’s no good for data plans. I won’t do premium until the Bluetooth hijack is fixed.
Pandora has been a stellar program for me for years. I never minded the ads, they used to be rare for me, and I didn’t mind when they upped the ad frequency. It was still a minor price to pay for what I was getting. My only complaint there was the inconsistency of 20 minutes no ads!... then three ads after each song for 30 :(  The real problem I have, with three stars being generous here, is the crashing. It would be five stars, but will go to one if this isn’t fixed soon. The last couple updates have been causing my phone to flat out crash (die) I will have 88% battery and after running pandora for half a song my phone says it is depleted and needs charging for about ten minutes. Then, when it finally starts up without charging, my phone acts like it never happened. I’ve had to completely stop using pandora because of this. I used to use pandora 3-5 times a week for hours. Now, once or twice just to see if it is still doing this.  [iPhone 6 with the latest update] 
Some people have to work to pay the bills. All the constant and same commercials are ridiculous and will not help turn units or subs or whatever you keep trying to sell. It really makes you not want to spend money on these brands and now I even dislike them. Beware companies advertising through this venue.
I love Pandora. I use this app frequently. I like this app better than other music apps. I considered deleting it because it crashes constantly. But since the last update, it has been running beautifully. Thanks for fixing the bugs!
Don’t get me wrong. Pandora is great with the variety of music is has. However, I stopped listening because the app would cause my phone to randomly restart when I listened to it. I thought is was my phone because I had the iPhone 6s, and it was pretty dumb, but when I got the iPhone 8, it did the SAME THING. It’s annoying.
Es lo mejor the best😜🤪😜🤪😜🎶😍
Every day when all I have open on my phone is Pandora it crashes and then locks the phone.
Thanks a lot for playing so many great songs, keep on rocking this world 🎼music is life 😃
There are way WAY too many adds on this app and I am not about to pay for anything I will just go and use I heart radio 😂 like seriously like one every two 5 minutes??? Wow
This song helped with a stage if depression that i had and i appreciate it very much!
His music saves me.  It brings the light of our Lord and Savior upon me.   I feel good listening to it.  It leads my day and ends my night.   Praise God.   His music warms His glory in my life.   Praise God.   I raise my hands in the air each time I listen to him.   He is the man.  God has blessed him with song, amen.
My daily 2 hour commutes would not be as enjoyable without Pandora. Who else knows me better to suggest music I didn’t even know existed?
Pandora can help you relax your musical ears anytime you’re feeling doing and give you the pick up your day needs to unwhine
The DIY stations are great, but frequently the updates will be flawed. Try to wait for updates that have few complaints. This last one required me to delete then reinstall. Now it is ok after more than a month of frustration.
This app allows for a lot of listening with great access to unlimited listening but this app crashes my phone and resets it all the time
This app keeps crashing. That’s why I don’t pay.
Pandora lover since the beginning.
I really love this app but recently when it open it will glitch and my phone goes black then the loading sign will appear and my iPhone starts up like normal and it’s only when this app is open.
Anyone else have an issue while playing music? I’ll lock my phone and it will play a song or two just find by then randomly in the middle of a song the music will shut off and my phone has a loading symbol like it’s being turned off but it doesn’t shut off it just asks for my code and then I have to re open the app but it will do this continuously throughout the time I listen to it... it’s only with pandora...I have the iPhone 7 Plus by the way please fix this pandora!
This is the best app in on earth for music. Although way too many ads
My mom got pandora and I said I wanted it to but it dose not work I do not know why 😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥 but it is a cool app my Mom  always had a big play list  I love this app🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂 When I got the app I was so excited to try it and I did it plays all the songs that you like and never plays the song that you don\'t like but I love songs so I never put 👎 I always put👍because I love music
Recently I’ve been getting WAY to many ads; mind you it’s never been a huge issue for me to listen to a few ads so I can listen to free music. However.. I’ve been getting two 30 second ads, song comes on I don’t like, skip said song (maybe two but no more than that), two more 30 second ads come up. Like seriously? It used to be ever 5-6 songs you’d get an ad. - Then you’ve got my boyfriend who never gets ads except once in a blue moon (he doesn’t have Pandora + or premium).  Then as of the last three months or so, Pandora will randomly crash. When I reopen it, either the last song I hear will come back on or it will go back to the first song Pandora played for me that day... always at a much louder volume then I have it set it. 
I never had any problems with the app until iOS 11 on my iPhone 8. When I launch the app, it won’t play the current song and the next and play/pause buttons don’t work. The only thing that fixes it is to force close the app and relaunch. A big pain, especially when in the car (and then somewhat dangerous). Please fix this annoying issue.
Still waiting on that iPhone X screen enhancement...
I love Pandora but not when it just starts playing without me turning it on or even opening the app. Then there is no way to turn it off! When I’m driving & on a phone call or trying to listen to driving directions it just starts playing I can’t turn it off! Not a safe situation while driving. I had to delete the app it was the only way to silence it!! It just wouldn’t stop.
I’ve been a pandora listener for over 10 years and a premium subscriber for over 6 years. In the last 2-3 months I have had so many issues. The app constantly freezes. EVERY time I open the app it locks up. Then after a few app open and close cycles and an occasional crash it works ok until I do anything to it. Like skip or station change. It is useless in my SYNC3 system on my Ford- which until the last update was fine. If the issues are not resolved very soon I’ll be unsubscribing and finding a less stressful way to listen to music. I have a new iPhone and all updates and no other app issues.
I can’t believe that you haven’t updated the screen experience for the IPhone X. It’s been a month I just downloaded the new update and still no go. Can’t believe it.
This app crashes my phone EVERY single time that I use it now. It happens within the first 10 minutes of starting the app and resets my entire iPhone 7plus so that I can’t even use the fingerprint I.D. I actually have to put my pin in to get the phone to start working again! FIX!!! IT!!! 
Just a crap ton of crashes from the pandora app. Keeps losing condition and is also associated with making my phone turn off every time . Please fix this ASAP
Pick the not so obvious artist of the genre for the songs not played to death found elsewhere.
I love pandora. Though it’s not perfect (not an extremely extensive selection of music or channel choices, don’t know how to buy some music - not sure if it’s linked to iTunes). But I listen to it every day at work. And at night I play soft music for my boys to fall asleep. <3
The Pandora app has let me open my life upon a whole new world of music. I just want to say thank you for letting this happen!
Sooo much crashing
It's the best!!! Ever!!!!! Couldn't live without it!!!always your favorite songs a thumbprint away.
Great music options.
I enjoy Pandora for all seasons and feelings. A little pick me up or calm me down is right here!
Continuous updates for bugs and fixing crashes but the app constantly crashes every time I use it! It exits out of everything I was doing on my phone.... Really annoying, don’t recommend
Love my favorite Radio station 👍🏼👍🏼
PLEASE MAKE IT FIT TO THE IPHONE X SCREEN. Thanks
The best of the best..... Nothing compares to great music that is on continuance play all day long! Great songs, great artists, just the best! My life is music and music is my life!
My phone keeps crashing even after the latest update. My screen goes black with the spinning circle then my phone restarts.  I’ve thought about upgrading to the pay service but not if it keeps crashing my device.
Its for a lot of people who like or don't like music and for you and all
Too many ads now
Best music app out their!
Still lots of issues with the app 12-13-17. Keeps playing after I turn my vehicle off and can’t stop it without killing the app. Won’t restart playing when reopened. Buttons don’t work (play, pause, etc.)
Nice app   Good en 
Excellent for the car, streaming!
When I feel like listening to David Gilmore and his style of music, Classical music, Steely Dan, Celtic music, or Liquid Mind to help3312 Latham St Rockford IL 61103 United States Pandora for a few years. 
My app has decided it won’t play any of my stations and I’ve tried everything you’ve said.
I wish it could have an option to break it into more of genres instead of having to make a station all the time
Love it the best everyday no competition I wouldn’t trade it for any other radio app
This app had been crashing every time I use it. Junk
To many commercials the 1 hour I’m in the gym there has to be at least 10.
It ALWAYS crashed my phone on my iPhone 7 and now it’s doing it on my iPhone 8. It’s getting to be so annoying. Please fix this! Also, quit playing the same 6 songs every time I play one of my stations.
When we hit the replay but it would be nice to finish the song then go to comercial and then replaying. Now it stops and goes to comercial and then starts over. 😡
Amazing app. Never fails to brighten my day:)
I think that this pandora app is awesome and I want it to stay forever and u guys could just work on your settings and I want to be able to create our own voice like if we got to make our own radio of ourselves 🙂 Just some tips and😃
The update refuses to load!
Always hear my favorite songs and some new ones thrown in

I can’t believe how much the quality of this app has deteriorated over time. Used to be awesome until maybe 6 months ago. Now crashes my phone iPhone after every 10 to 15 minutes. I’m going over to Spotify. You lost me Pandora for terrible quality control.....
It is so nice to find my mix in the min. Thank you.
Love Pandora but this whole unlimited skips and rewind doesn’t work while driving. 👎🏼
Plays the same songs
I wrote to Pandora support frustrated that I cannot access all subscription options from a mobile device (no matter how much I request desktop site in Safari!), and was met with a 2-month trial offer for Pandora Premium. Premium has far and away reshaped the listening experience. Tons of music can be searched and played immediately, repeat played infinitely, full albums played through and repeated. The songs that are not (yet) licensed for immediate search and play can still be made into stations to match the song\'s genre categorization. The user interface looks prettier than the plain no-subscription counterpart. It is a very inclusive version of Pandora and best of all, not an ad to be seen or heard no matter how many hours listened or songs skipped.  Only drawbacks for me, the price and competing music service prices are all too high. My $20 iTunes gift card couldn\'t stretch to a second month of Premium. It is missing a repeat option, so a user must manually replay a song or album for each replay. And it would be very useful to have the options flyout menu (top left of the app) always visible no matter to which depth one has navigated in their music discovery.  Nevertheless, I am very thankful for the trial subscription. I tried a paid month since then and found Premium still to be just as satisfying apart from the monthly subscription price. 
Got to tunes app turned trash.  App freezes, sometimes works for 15-20 seconds or until phone automatically locks.  Time to look at competitors, I really enjoyed the old app that worked.
Because she the best and I love the song and the song that pandora put
I love pandora they always play the right songs that I need and it’s like I am my own Dj in a way😂❤️
Over the last couple years my iPhone consistently crashes at least twice a day while listening to Pandora. Never happens any other time. I can’t believe they haven’t fixed this issue. It’s quite annoying and frustrating especially when I’m in the middle of a set at the gym. I use pandora for my car and for my workouts but i absolutely hate the crash issue. This needs to be fixed.
I enjoy the variety Pandora plays, great music discovery, but what I don't like are the crashes and unoptimized app for iPhone X, why when so many other apps are optimized??? I find myself using Spotify more frequently due to this. Oh and crashes often when resuming from pause.
I’ve been a pandora user since 2011 and I’ve tried other apps but found my way back every time. I highly recommend
This app is now garbage. WAAAAY TOO MANY ADS. And constantly crashes by the use of other ads or notifications. Not a fan of pandora anymore.
I have a 7+ phone, I love the app, and use it most if not all days. After the last update a day or so ago, I can’t use the app! If I open the app, is ether it freezes, or does not play nothing. Today I got it to play, but when try to pause ether thru the lock screen or in the app it won’t pause and it lock my phone up. After a restart of the phone I check for updates to the OS but everything is up to date. So in my way of viewing things the app is the one that needs improvement!
I used to be able to be outside of WiFi range and I could connect to pandora no problem. Now it’ll load and just sit on the screen for the last song it played. Nothing will play and the app won’t load a new song.
I like pears
I love listening to my favorite stations.
All this app needs to do is play music yet it can’t even do that, buttons work infrequently, constantly unresponsive, don’t even get me started on Bluetooth car integration!
AWESOME!!!
Keeps crashing
Pause was still broken for me, but once I deleted and reinstalled it worked again.   Previous review: Dig it. Works for me and no problems, especially after I subscribed. 
Temoc1016
Would get a better star review if they optimized it for iPhone X.
Love every radio station 😳❤️
Still rockin’
I like it but I wish it was more music when you search a name
The same music is being played all the time. The music needs to be updated.
Love how the station keeps the music fresh
I am grateful. :)
In app pause still doesn’t work
New update (as of Dec 13) is causing free version of pandora to crash and stop working. I know y’all are trying to fix the bugs in the premium version but I guess it caused one to pop up in the original app. ✌🏻
I have been a loyal Pandora listener for years now, but with Pandora’s most recent update, it has gone to crap. I mainly use it in my car. I used to be able to use my car controls to pause, play, and skip songs, now that is not the case. I can’t even pause the music when plugged in or through Bluetooth. I have to skip songs using my phone. I’m very disappointed with the most recent update.
Upgraded to premium hoping for a “premium” experience, but I can’t even edit a playlist. This app crashes constantly! It’s frustrating considering the $13 price tag.
I’ve been using pandora app since my first iPhone 3GS and now when I use it, it seems like after 2 songs it goes to 3 commercials/ Ads and the app keeps shutting down after 30 min or so
For probably 2-3 months now it keeps crashing on me. I think I’m getting a call, but in fact it just shuts down and I have to go back in and restart it for no particular reason. This is very frustrating!
In the last 24 hours I’ve used pandora for about 3 hours intermittently, yet it used 50% of my phone’s battery. This heavy battery consumption only started happening with the latest pandora version. Any advice to use less battery? For comparison, Facebook used only 17% in the last 24 hours.
It’s good I like the songs they play
I use the iPhone 8plus and ever since I got this phone pandora periodically closes in the middle of songs.  When I open it back up it starts the last song I was listening to from the beginning.  I thought that after the las update that would correct the problem, but it hasn’t. It has gotten to the point that I am using Spotify more as it doesn’t close randomly.
Great way to listen to all your favorites and find new music.
Not as good as before
Good
Easy to use even for a old guy.  Would recommend for people that are not technically inexperienced.
Good job guys
It fine
Why have you changed how you integrate with the Sonos?   Many still prefer stations in the Sonos app to be sorted alphabetically and not chronologically. Interestingly this is still an option however it in your Pandora app. Sonos states this is your issue and then only other option is to use your Pandora app to control our Sonos systems.   Really don’t like the limited Pandora app functionality to control Sonos and preferred the integration the way it had been previously for years.
I have been charged for premium multiple times, over 50.
Continues to crash. Deleting and reinstalling does not do anything. In the middle of listening to songs the app crashes and my phone reboots. Amazing work guys!

Update still messed up. CarPlay still doesn’t work right. Maybe someone should check the update before it put out.
Now heaping pile of garbage. Someone must lost a key Devloper at Pandora labs. This app used to be flawless. Now crashes and doesn’t work half the time. Pressing pause doesn’t work much and the app has to be force quit. Several updates later and these bugs are still present. Why am I paying for this?
Totally enjoying all the different types of music I downloaded. I get what I want when I want depending on the mood I’m in . Again totally awesome.
Title says it all
Where is it?
Every song now has an ad after it, It was never this way until just recently and it’s completely a waste of time, if something isn’t done to reduce the amount of ads I will find a new app to use.
Constantly kicks me off the app
Plays good musics and it’s a fun app
It has all the music you like and its great with premium added to it
Pandora comes thru at the right times
Pandora is running way too many ads. It used to be better and now it’s sometimes worse than live radio.
It doesn't get any better than Pandora!!

I’m having to force quit because I can’t pause it
I listen to basic Pandora with Ads on my iPhone and it always just works. The ads are no fun of course, but at least they are way better than commercial radio.  I have to say that for what it is, Pandora is pretty awesome!  I listen to music, pretty much whatever I want, and I'm always introduced to new artists and songs I wouldn't have heard from if it weren't for Pandora.  For you haters out there, if you are having problems with Pandora, then reach out to their customer service team so they can understand your problem and actually get the chance to address it.  Good software is hard and the Pandora team has shown they have what it takes to make great software!  Thanks folks!! 
I absolutely love this app, however, it has been shutting down a lot lately. Usually after the first 30 seconds of a song. I then have to close pandora (by swiping the app up) and then reopening it. It’s quite annoying because it happens every two, three, four, or five songs. Please fix your app.
For the thumbprint radio I wish there was a more variety of music similar to the ones that were thumbed up because it’s tiring listening to the same songs at times. Other than this one flaw I absolutely love pandora.
Ive used pandora forever, ever since highschool. Over the years its been a great app for someone like me, who cant decide what i want to listen to, but with the updates lately when im in the app, my phone will suddenly turn off! It only does it when im in this app, ive updated the app my iphone, and these problems keep occurring more and more. I would hate to say goodbye to Pandora, but reseting my phone out of the blue is concerning to me.
I finally got a car with Bluetooth and was so excited to get pandora in it.  But the latest update won’t even play! All the app does is freeze pause not play.  Screw this. Smooth job guys. I’d never pay for this !!!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I like being able to listen to my music. But when An ad interrupts me it drives me nuts.
A1🗣‼️
I’m not sure what was changed but Pandora is NOT working anymore. Constantly freezing, constant shutting off on its own. I pay for music, I’d like to hear it... in its entirety. Please fix this problem ASAP otherwise it’s time to jump ship and find something else. Mayb just one person saying this doesn’t make a difference but from the looks of it. I’m not alone.

My favorite app, Love the ability pull up most of the artists lyrics.
The app resets from time to time! I will be listening and next thing I know the app drops! Now it maybe the iPhone, but it happens when I listen to Pandora! Other than that I love it and I have Apple Music and Tidal
Just started my trial of Premium. It never works. When I try to play a song, it jumps from song to song without ever playing a second of actual music.   Sorry guys, but Spotify got my money over you.   Fix your app and clean up the appearance a bit and it might be worth the money. A working app would be a good start. 
Well the app keeps getting unstable as the updates happen. I use the app in offline mode to save data....I can’t pause, skip on the lock screen, it will show on my Apple Watch I’m playing music, but again I can’t pause or skip their either, I have to unlock the app and skip from there. Half the time I open the app it won’t even play right away it freezes and I have to close and reopen the app for it to play. I pay money for this app and I can’t even use it to its full potential.
Always works! It also gives me other artists that I had no clue of, so it expands my taste. This is the only app that I have used for almost 7 years...  Great job, Pandora!
App freezes up after disconnecting then reconnecting to Bluetooth. Super annoying
I love the variety that Pandora offers. When I listen to music, nothing else matters!
Still dealing with play/pause button not working. Or pandora completely closes out.
Literally every time I use the app within five songs my phone dies and restarts. It is this app. I’ve tried making sure it was the only app open at a time and that didn’t help. Without fail the app crashes and my phone goes black and restarts itself. What the??  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I have been a long time user of Pandora, with over five years of service across many devices. This app has been my go to for quality music that I like while maintaining an unobtrusive add nature. However with the latest selection of add they have begun running advertisements calling for the removal of the president of the United States, Donald Trump. I cannot in good faith support an application which uses its platform to push a political agenda instead of providing the service I use it for. So until such adds are removed I will no longer be using this program. To all who find this trend of ridiculous politicizing unacceptable look for other music apps than this one. I for one will be using Sirius radio now.
Keep getting error messages when I try to listen to one of my stations from my list I\'ve had for years.  Just keep getting error message \"That station cannot be loaded right now, please pick another.\"  Only, it\'s ALL my stations giving that error message.  Pure JUNK!! Wish I had never updated.  No wonder all I see are one star reviews lately. If only there were an option for zero stars. So disappointed.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I love pandora, I always use it to listen to music whenever but only on WiFi. You can choose a station based on the genre of music you like, the artist and more. Pandora has a few features called Pandora premium, pandora plus. I suggest getting is because it gets rid of ads, the ability to replay songs and unlimited skips. I currently do not have either but would love to get them in the future because I experience lots of ads. Overall
I have been using pandora a long time and upgraded about 6 months ago months to ad free- upon doing so I got a free trial for pandora plus. When my trial ended I’ve had nothing but prob with the regular paid pandora - freezes and I can’t fast forward or push play button and have to close it; try to open and it says no connection although I do ; stops playing for no reason ( it’s not when it says ‘are you still listening’) only after 2-3 songs  Frustrating bc I think I might go back to ads or find a different service  I agree with other reviewers- why aren’t these upgrades tested better first? 
Gracias Pandora Feliz Navidad !!! Eres el mejor regalo de la vida 🕎🎄🎅🏻❤️🙏🏼 
Will it be updated to fit the iPhone X screen or ?
Can you please make iPhone X Support. Other than that nice app
It's ok but needs variety
This app is the best
I’ve been using Pandora for years and never had any major issues. That is until the last few updates. Every time I launch the app it never plays the first song  loaded. I try to skip to the next track and guess what. The controls don’t respond. I try to skip to the next song through the app and the same thing, nothing no response. So now I have to close the app relaunch it and it still won’t respond. I thought maybe it was The Bluetooth in my truck but it does the same thing on all My Bluetooth devices. Just like all the other reviews it stops randomly in the middle of a song ,when it finally plays one after several try’s,  after the end of a song it can take a few minutes to play the next song. Most times I have to relaunch the app once again to get it playing again. It Doesn’t matter if I’m on WiFi or not. Not sure what was changed but it needs to addressed or Spotify and Apple Music will start getting a lot more customers.   Ps. I’m running the latest version of the app and the latest iOS 11.2 
Things are working again and life is back to normal.
Many ads showing .
Has always been one of my favorite apps.  Now I have to restart every time I open it. Won’t play songs. Have to swipe up constantly. It seems like weeks now. Why no fix?

The app keeps crashing on me. I use Pandora in the car since I have a long drive. But lately I’ve been having the app being the only one opened and my phone just stops playing the music, app freezes, and my phone completely restart itself! No other app does this or is opened when my phone does this. :/ Has been happening for the past two updates. I am considering deleting the app all together!

This is ridiculous.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble.

Continually crashes when going in and out of apps! When disconnecting from Bluetooth, it continues to play and the all the function keys (pause/play/ etc...) are unresponsive. Always have to hard reset it. I have deleted and re downloaded the app multiple times. When it come to the iwatch the app is useless because all you get to see is the loading wheel despite resetting the watch and re-downloading  the app... this was a fantastic app but I’d quickly coming out favor with the brevity of errors
Yes I like the app,just hate the commercials lol
Pandora is so good at finding new music I like and turning me on to new artists. But we pay for Spotify to download all the music we want for the road and offline.
as of today the app is \"unable to save my feedback\" when i thumbs up/down a track and it has completely crashed or stopped working more than once. everything was working normally yesterday. i checked for updates and applied those that were available but the problem persists. very disappointing.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Love pandora!!!
YET ANOTHER WORTHLESS UPDATE! NO SUPPORT FOR THR IPHONE X! Seriously!?
With this new update yesterday I can no longer see when someone is listening at same moment as me, nor what they listening too!! This is what made you different from everyone else... Now you all just alike! Disappointing!! 
Worked just fine yesterday then I updated the app last night. Tried to use it this morning and upon clicking the thumbs up/down buttons, I get an error message that says, “Unable to save your feedback” with options to either try again or cancel. Trying again does no good so I just end up canceling. Without the ability to provide feedback on songs, it’s a toss up as to whether or not the next track will be something I’m likely to enjoy.
Pretty good
Plays ok music, doesn’t really as much music from the artist that is chosen for a station. App crashes without warnings. I guess you get what you pay for.
Plays two or three songs, then shuts off.
by far the most aggravating app in the store , i would never pay for pandora !
Crashes all the time. And whenever thunder by imagine dragons comes on, it plays Africa by Todo. I’m not saying that’s a bad thing, just letting you know.  But you should really fix the crashes and ridiculous number of adds/ long loading times.
Can you stop asking me to link Pandora with my Facebook? It's annoying and I hate that I'm constantly asked to do so. If I want to keep my social media accounts separate I should be allowed to.  Otherwise the app is great, I don't mind the commercials bc I know that's how you guys can make money and keep your free services. The Christmas station is dope af. 
Goes into hijack mode in my car.  Can’t use my phone or any apps just a black pandora screen.  Deleted it.  Closed both accounts and am moving to Spotify.  No way to disable that feature.

After the last two updates, I can’t even get through one song without that app crashing my phone. Really frustrating because I really liked using pandora.. it never used to do that, used to work perfectly.. I would listen all day, everyday!
I’ve been using Pandora for years and now that I started paying for it, it doesn’t work right. Can’t connect to Bluetooth in my car or speaker as I have ALWAYS done before. You can no longer pause the music, you have to shut the app all the way down. Cannot use the buttons on the home screen to make it change songs, you have to physically go into the app to change a song. It continuously says it cannot save my feedback. If I don’t leave the app open the song stops playing and you have to shut the app down and restart it. If someone calls it will not resume music. You have to shut the app down and restart it. I don’t know what happened but Pandora has really messed this app up.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I have been paying for Pandora for over 4 yrs now. This station frustrates me more every day! I have Bluetooth in my car but I have several issues....first I have to swipe out all my apps on my phone, then I have to wait at least 5 minutes before it even connects to my WiFi, once it does, it freezes up then  I have to swipe out Pandora, this takes several attempts and EVERY day, I start the whole process again!  I have to cross my fingers and hope it works. I have several days a week where it doesn’t work at all! I’m seriously thinking about canceling Pandora and going elsewhere! This is horrible for a paid subscription. I have a new iPhone and I do every update. I hope and pray this update works! This has been going on for months! Also, can they let a person thumb up or down a station without having to log into my phone each time...can anyone reply to this, I’d like to pay for a different station that works.
Having exact same issues as suzieq86   & Offline requires connection ?! Complete bs 
When will you optimize for the iPhone X
The new update is horrible !!!!! I hate it !!! It was perfectly fine the way it was then y’all had to update it * why !!?,?! Just change it back I don’t  even wanna be rating u one star :/
I love pandora and hardly ever have issues. However, lately I haven’t been able to save any new songs because the like button is “unable to save my feedback” it would be great if this could be resolved. I’ve already updated my phone along with the app itself.
I use this app almost everyday but this last update has me fed up! It crashes, it freezes, it force closes, it makes my phone literally restart on its on in the middle of a song! How can I enjoy music if I can’t even listen to a full song! iPhone 6 user here with 11.2...loyal app user for many years but get ur software to act right before I have to stick with a competitor and delete you completely

The app recently has decided to start playing on its own, even if the app is running in the “background”. Most recently, started playing music while on a phone call and NOT in the background...get it together Pandora!  Learn to thumbs up and down songs for good playlists and to cater to the genre. 
Following the most recent update, my Pandora randomly stops playing and won’t allow me to pause music when it actually does play. Total crap and enormously frustrating.
Automatically resubscribes for you if you don’t want it
I have had it for years still jammin
Every time you guys push out an update to "fix crashes", my Pandora app crashes more often! I am not sure you guys know what it means to fix crashes...I am so done with this software.
So, the recent update broke the ability to control Pandora via the lock screen for me.
So I try doing a thumbs up on a song and it keeps saying "unable to save your feedback" with the options of "cancel" or "try again" and the try again doesn't work. Please try to fix this
I’ve been using Pandora since the original release on PC. All of my likes and dislikes over many years are still intact and fit for me.  Now years have passed and I’m a premium member and love this service, appreciate the updates and app support from the staff of many that work daily to keep great music on my smert phern stimulating my ear holes with constant beats to tap my feet and swing m hips to.  Here’s to you Pandora Guys!  From all of us inside my head, Thank you!  😊 
Why is it so difficult to log in/out?  Other music apps need only a single tap!
Why can I not use my chrome cast anymore??!?  I am no longer able to stream pandora to my tv after the new update, is there anyway I can fix this or go back an update
I pay for Pandora Premium, and I am thinking it’s a waste! Here lately I’m having nothing but problems. Freezing, unable to pause,& and when it does pause it won’t play again!
Force closing smh
I used to love Pandora, but for the last several months stations are unavailable too often, and the app stops or closes by itself, which definitely doesn’t help when you try to use it as your alarm in the morning.
I like the variety of stations but if you listen to the same station you will hear the same songs repeat, there is no variety within a station...
I have had this app (free version) for several years. Fir the last year (about) it will just randomly shut down. I am fed up with it! Most of the time it wont continue playing for the duration of my shower- so i go through half of my shower in silence.
I am currently trying out the free trial of Pandora Plus and I’m not sure if I like it. While I have my phone in the lock screen I CAN NOT pause the music nor does the artist or song title show. Which makes it difficult to use while at work. I want to go back to the plan ol Pandora but can’t figure out how to do it. Please help! I don’t want to have to delete it entirely. Thank you
I like be it so much
Please add iPhone X support.. surprised this is one of the later apps to get it considering how much it’s used.
Mr Bob Dobalina.  I hate your little trick where you ask me the same question every day, then put a delay on my touch repose and put up a new (redundant) question with the response I will never give you in the exact location of the previous location of the answer I always give, prompting me to accidentally open my password prompt to buy pandora.  I would rather quit your free service and pay for a different service(after 6 years of using pandora). Because your little trick pisses me off.  Change that dumb crap and maybe I’ll pay for it.  A holes. 
Ok. Overall, I really like this app, I use it everyday while getting ready for school. But I keep trying to like songs that aren’t in my thumbs up history and it’s saying “unable to save your feedback” and then it says “cancel” or “try again” I hit “try again” multiple times and it does not work. It was working perfectly finesse night when I was getting for bed. I don’t want to delete the all and I’m not going to it you need to fix this ASAP.
I would like it to fit the display of the iPhone X. Other than that everything else is fine for me. So keep up the good work!
Sometime in the last couple months of 2017, the Release team for the Pandora App, or at least its iOS version made a very stupid decision and pulled the trigger on an unstable terrible version. Not only that, the only way to recover from it is to completely remove the app & reboot your phone.  I’ve never had to do this before; not on iOS or Android. I nearly cancelled my years-long subscription out of frustration.  Shame on whomever approved this terrible update that affected so many of us. I hope they found new employment where they’re more effective in a positive way, instead of a catastrophic way. 
I've used Pandora for years before it would even allow you to search your own music now I can't listen to specific artists playlist, because of "restrictions" will be cancelling soon...
I wish that when you choose an artist they come up more frequently than other artist but still good nonetheless
I have a premium subscription. There’s a bug that makes it skip songs continuously and very quickly. Closing the app and restarting it doesn’t usually work. Deleting and reinstalling doesn’t work.  Edit: Has been working better since the update, Thanks!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for the trouble you are experiencing - this is something we are actively looking into.

2 commercials after every song??? Really??? Seriously???
Well pandora is (in my opinion) awesome for little kids like me because u can play games and hear music but I do have two complaints pandora if u fix dis I will give u a five  Soooo first complaint is that I think u should be able to skip and replay songs without watching ads  my second complaint is that I think u should be able to pick some songs and not just artists well other than that pandora is awesome! 
Premium ? It's bad enough the app cknstantkky freezes and crashes but I lay monthly and they can't even optimize the app for the iPhone X ? Come on guys you release updates for everything but that ?!?!
I’m loving my pandora!!!!!  It rocks!!!!!! 
I’m lazy to search and download music that’s why I love pandora. But sometimes pandora don’t let me play music it freezes either before getting in or during the station!
Too many ads and premium is expensive
Love pandora
Pandora has a good selection of music and is a good when you first open the app. Only problem is after you’ve been on one station for awhile it will start mixing crap into your favorite stations. My Queens of the Stone Age Station plays more Deftones Station than my Deftones Station and vice versa. And it’s not unlimited skips for 5 dollars a month. It’ll play songs that fall into the genre when you first open the Station and after about 5 songs it’ll just mix crap into it. After about 20 skips it won’t let you and say “cannot skip this track due to licensing agreement”. It’ll also announce that a station isn’t available sometimes after only one or two skips. It has a lot of potential but it seems like they just advertise as unlimited by mixing in corny independent bands that are distantly related to your station’s genre. I have a “Seasons in the abyss” that is supposed to play slayer and related bands and it hasn’t played a slayer song the last couple times that I selected it.
The app does not fit the display of the iPhone X, please fix! The apps shuffle feature in playlist also needs to be fixed.
It crashes often and shuts off my phone. But I love all of the music!
Pandora is fine but if you don’t have premium u will hear A LOT OF ADS AND SONGS U DON’T LIKE But other than that it’s ok
Thanks, for all of the good music😀. You should really allow more skips
I would definitely give 5 stars once I'm able to keep the app open more than a couple songs. Pandora is my go to app for all of my music and I miss it! It's been crashing since the last update.
Why put out an update that makes the app function worse?
The latest updates have been a disaster. Two main issues I’m having:  1) I use Apple AirPods at work. Since the last Pandora update when I take one earphone out to answer my work phone or speak to a coworker, rather than automatically pausing the music (which is what is supposed to happen) it transfers the music to my iPhone. I have to remember to turn my phone sound all the way down before opening Pandora so I don’t blast away my coworkers with my music when I take an earphone out.  2) I never know when the music is going to stop. Opening another app, locking my phone or minimizing Pandora now randomly turns off the music. Not every time, but often enough to be irritating. Sometimes just pressing play and waiting 30 seconds is enough to pause the music. I’m close to giving up on this app. I can’t stand the commercials so I pay a monthly fee to have ad free music but lately it feels like a waste of music.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

8 updates since the iPhone X came out ...8 and the app still freezes, requires force closes daily and is such a step down in quality from when I first subscribed... I have been paying for pandora for 4 years now and it was much better before . Now the app just plays the same 6 songs when I first started using pandora it would introduce new music and update playlists with new similar tracts in that genre now it doesn’t at all I can listen to a station today and here the exact same songs I’ve heard for the last 6 months nothing new. Just all around bad this is not what I pay for there are better I-radios and ones that have already been updated for the iPhone X that are better quality have less bugs and introduce music at a better pace....
Love it
This is app is awesome
It’s the best
Weary of upgrading because while listening in my car or on my phone it drops off often.
Pandora is great for music! Been using it for 4 years now. Although, when will an update be released for it to optimized for the iPhone X?
To request an update from a music streaming APP is a joke. The iPhone X has been out for a month now.   Canceling my premium subscription and going to Tidal which costs 3x more simply because they’re more innovative. 
I am just building my music list.
Why am I not able to cancel my subscription through the app? So annoyed right now!
Don’t censor the music and keep adding new content, keep up the good work.
Are you aware of iPhone X?
After several recent updates, Pandora still has not developed an update that formats the app to fit the new iPhone X screen layout.
When you close the app the music keeps playing you have to open it and close it again to make it stop. On the lock screen it doesn’t even tell you what song is playing it just says “pandora” . if the app is paused by watching some video or playing music on another app you can’t go back to play it again it’s frozen and you have to close the app and start it up again. That’s just the worst problems.
I love music and I love Pandora!
Pandora used to work great. For the past few months it shuts down after 10-15 minutes. It not only shuts the app, it also forces my phone to closes other apps, like texting and emailing.....dumping my drafted messages/texts before I can send them. It does this even if I don’t have other functions going at the same time. Never had this issue with my iPhone 5S....with less storage and memory..16G.  But now with my iPhone 7Plus...128G...and my daughters iPhone 7, it happens all the time.

While I love my XM Radio this blows it out of the water!!!!!  I love being able to create my own channels and say what I like.  I am hooked after one day!  Thank you!!!!
I’ve been paying for premium for a few months now, but now I have to go back Through and re-download a huge number of songs or stations so that they will play. There’s no other way around it. What a rip off, doesn’t even work when I’m in offline mode. 
Keeps crashing!
Ditto to Suzi’s review.  I deleted the app and I’m try re-download too see if that works. So frustrating!!!!
Ads are never relevant to me. Tried adjusting my zipcode but still didn't help.
Great logic on how to creat an personalized playlist. You don't need to spend specialized time to manage your play list. Just hit like or dislike as you rock. Easy and efficient! Top-notch management concept!
❤️ love pandora
Pandora gives you a chance to hear songs you never get to hear !
But makes my iPhone 7 shut off daily
I can’t cancel my subscription from the app. I have to cancel it from the website. I can’t open Pandora’s full site from my phone (it just redirects to the app). I pay $10 a month and you still have music that I’m not allowed to listen to directly?? What am I paying for?? Worst music service I’ve ever had. Can’t close music out. It auto plays whatever you were listening to last when you open the app? Why? What if I’m in a professional setting and I last listened to unprofessional music? You don’t even have a customer service phone number. I want my money back please contact me.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Pandora has a new game now where it stops a song half way and jumps to a new one.   The second part of the game is where it will shut off and restart my entire phone. Which is especially great if I’m using pandora and google maps while driving to a new place, and now I’m lost because pandora stopped my whole phone. So I have no way of stopping in the middle of the highway to re-enter the address in my google maps.  Also, pandora is continually repeating the same songs over and over. It is not adding any new suggestions for songs or artist. I like one songs, I may just hear 3 or 4 times in one day... why?? No thank you. Just give me a new song to like. Very very disappointed with this app that I used to love.  Old Review: I absolutely love it! I do hate when freezes when I'm not on wifi but other than that, pandora is great. Also, the advertisements are getting out of control; they are very annoying. That's why I'm not going them 5 stars. 
I’ve finally come to the end of my patience with Pandora. It’s a real shame because they do have in my opinion the best curated playlists, but the app malfunctions so much, it makes using it more of a hassle than it’s worth. I was excited to see Pandora finally offer an offline listening option. I travel a lot and need my playlists to be available when I’m in airplane mode. I particularly enjoy listening to my “liked” songs. The problem is that when you “like” a song, it often doesn’t download to the offline playlist and for some dumb reason this renders the entire playlist unplayable until all of the missed likes are downloaded. Pretty useless if you’re on an airplane. That combined with the multitude of times I’ve had to restart the app because there’s just no sound coming out, or because it’s not working with Apple CarPlay leaves me with no option but to end my subscription and delete this piece of crap.
Has lots of songs! Fine tunes to your own personal music taste pretty nicely
How the hell do I stop paying for this I can’t find an option anywhere... I do not want it anymore.. heeelllllp
TOO MANY ADDS ITS ANNOYING AF
Need to lower the number of ads when i use pandora after about 5 minutes it shut down
Constantly freezes regardless of wifi and data connection. This has been an ongoing issue while using the Iphone X
I’ve been a loyal pandora user for a long time. I pay for pandora one to skip the ads and I use it all the time while I work/drive. As of a week or more ago the app has completely stopped working correctly and I’ve seen zero updates to fix it.  Sometimes it’ll just stop playing music 30 seconds in and freeze up. No matter what I can no longer pause the app, hitting the button literally does nothing. I’ve had to completely close out and reopen to stop and start. And, there’s zero control from the home screen anymore- it’s like they completely broke it and are doing nothing, just expecting us to all keep paying for a useless app. Fortunately there are other options- and I’m going to switch today. 
I am a paid subscriber and have use Pandora for at least the last six years to seven years maybe more. Whatever happened as of late with the iPhone updates in Pandora update I can no longer listen to Pandora when I switch between apps. It was nice that Pandora would override and work in cooperation with other apps so that I could get directions and still listen to music or be able to switch between and do a voice text and then come back and use the app again. Now when I ask Siri to open the app it freezes. Whenever I unplug my headset from the phone it freezes I have to repeatedly swipe it closed and open it again to make it work. I am up-to-date on all updates and this is extremely annoying since I use Pandora every day of my life. Also, Canada. Why doesn’t Pandora work in Canada? That is extremely annoying. Also my alarm goes off and Pandora freezes and I have to swipe the app closed.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Excellent!!
So, this is a great app, my only thing is that Pandora will not let me pause or play my songs sometimes. I’m able to like, dislike, replay, and skip, it just won’t let me pause or play which really bugs me.  PS: My phone and have the most recent update, and I don’t have Pandora Plus or Premium. 
I love pandora but the app has become the worst. It is unresponsive, reopens every time the phone rings, takes forever to load. It is a shame I am a longtime customer who uses a variety of iPhones and I think it is time to switch to another service.
I am experiencing the same bugs that SuziQ86 is talking about.  The app freezes during a song.  If you get a text or a notification during a song the app stops, then it’s frozen and you have to force close the app and then restart it to get it to play again.  Not good while driving!  Also it won’t start playing again after a call like it used to.
Enjoyment all’s way thank you
I enjoy all stations
While I’ve always been a fan of the Pandora product I’m very disappointed by their attempts (now successful) to have me unintentionally sign up for premium.  I was listening to Pandora at the gym with my phone in pocket.  When I took phone out it told me I had Judy signed up.  I know they want people to sign up and to make it easy, but they’ve crossed a line when this happens accidentally and they default to the most expensive tier.  I used to be a fan and advocate if this product, but this scammy approach is making me rethink where I stream my music.
Better than the rest
Pandora has been my go-to place for music since the very beginning when I used to play it from my computer. The app on my iPhone has always worked until the most recent Apple update. I’ve been trying to patiently wait for them to work out the bugs and fix it but it has been a month now at least and no fix!! Stops playing music, kicks you out, freezes and won’t let you play and now it won’t let me connect to devices to play it through my TV or other speakers. It’s not my phone bc it is doing it to my husband too and it does it on multiple devices. This is ridiculous and especially frustrating not being able to put on Christmas music at Christmas time and looking ahead Christmas morning!!! Please fix it!!!
Cant live without pandora!!!
I'm hearing all kinds of music that I have never heard of from this app. You should get it and there is ads here and there. But it is the best
I've had pandora for years and have accumulated  an amazing playlist btw. Now just recently( 2 wks ago) my pandora just crashes. Even the icon for the app is grayed out. Is this going to recover or Pandora is just dead now?
Haven’t been able to use my account! It hasn’t worked in about a month! When I try to go to my account settings it give me an error message. And when I decided I wanted to deactivate my account it gave me an error message for that as well so of course I’ve been charged for a service I can’t even use.
I’ve experienced crashes at least twice a day for the last couple of months. Every update since (about 2) have not fixed it.
Constantly running in the background draining my battery even though the app has been closed and all notifications and background refresh have been turned off.   Goodbye Pandora, deleting the app seems to be the only way to stop it from running. 
I used to love using Pandora.  The number of ads is getting a bit much.  On top of that, with all of the new updates it crashes literally almost every single time I try to use the app.  Unfortunately it’s getting to the point where it’s no longer enjoyable to listen to music with Pandora.  Update: despite the update a few days ago, it is STILL frequently crashing.  Very frustrating.  😡 
I love that pandora does all of the matching for me. I've been using it since high school and I've tried Spotify and I tunes but I never have the time to put a song in. I like that I can't just skip around with pandora and they can pretty much match a similar preference with the next song. The adds are annoying but I'm also on a budget. I honestly see myself using this more again than Manuel entry. Four out of five stars
The recent update broke the controls. The only way to willingly stop playback is force-quitting the app. Sadly, the app chooses halt on its own accord when playing in the background after 5-10 minutes. This makes the app useless in every possible way.   I\'ve been a happy, paying Pandora subscriber for something like a decade. Since I can use the phone app anymore, I\'m on the verge of cancelling.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Listen to everyday!!
Constantly crashes. Crashes even more when using maps. iPhone 7 Plus.
Sick af
I love pandora it has so much music
I love pandora but there if far too many adds. Also when you type in an attests name for their music it should really be just their music. Thanks
Love it
Love all the different stations, wish they played more music for each station, seems like it’s usually the same songs.
Whenever I select an artist it plays other artist on that station... which I don’t mind but at times I would love to listen to the same artist unless I decided to change the station. I’m a trucker I like a certain vibes not switched up when I’m in that vibe. I’m just saying!
Even though this is one the most top downloaded and developed apps, it still doesn’t support iPhone X’s large full screen. Annoying to see apps that still haven’t not adapted.
I love it!!!
Great app! Whatever my mood may be I can find a station to match it.
I love this app !!! Finally I can play music without loosing internet or gb
So annoying. Use to be great, now nothing but problems. Won’t even open, crashes every single time!
I love pandora.  Wouldn’t change anything about it.
This use to be a great app. But since the last update nothing works. The app freezes up about 30 second into a song. Oh and if you can finally get the app to work for longer than 30secondS God forbid you try and use Bluetooth or link to your car you won’t be able to control anything making hands free useless. I can’t believe I’m actually paying for this crap. Time to cancel and move on to Spotify.
This app is really good, use it a lot, like that they fixed all the crashing problems, works good they have all kinds of music...
Pandora gives you great music in the genre, track, artist, and albums.
Music hits my heart I love it!!!
Nice, real nice!
Y’all need to do better I don’t know what bugs y’all thought y’all fixed but this app is still acting up. Get it together please. I over all like Pandora with out the hassle
Perfect
Would like to see pandora optimized for the iPhone 10 screen.
Great app when it works but since update have open close app multiple times to get it to start working once going it goes fine but takes multiple tries to get it work.
I pay 3.99 a month for a buggy app that will suddenly crash. Once I close it, it’ll start playing music out of nowhere. I’m getting ready to delete this, this is ridiculous! Months now we’ve been dealing with these issues. Is there someplace I can request a refund for my months of using an app that doesn’t even words right?  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Please update for iPhone X screen resolution. Fix Rüfüs/Rufus du Sol cover art. It’s super annoying that it’s cut in half. FYI: Pandora is by far overpriced compared to other music services.
They lost a premium customer today. I've been using Pandora for years, premium for over 2 years, and the past month they broke the iOS app (stops playing screen turns off, loss of controls on the lock screen, pause/play buttons don't work at times). I gave them a month to fix it and although it now plays with the screen off again, plenty of other bugs aren't fixed. Moving to Spotify.
After using it for about a week under any station you never have to touch it again
I’ve tried to love pandora for years. I can deal with the ads but I constantly get errors on pretty much every station saying the station is currently unavailable. I’ve tried rebooting my phone, uninstalling/installing the app. This has been an issue on my last 3 phones! I give up.
Im listening to Bachata music and all of sudden it turns into country or rap. I look at my phone and the right artist is on the screen but a totally different song is playing! What gives Pandora?!?! I thought with the recent update it would fix it but no it hasn’t and this started about 6 months ago! It’s time to fix these bugs ASAP or I’m going another route!!! 😡🤬😡  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

After about two hours of listening to a station, it starts the play the same songs over and over again. With all the music of a certian genre, why does it do this?  I have premium and still dose the same even with search and unlimited skip. Need to update library more often. Went to Spotify because of this.
The app doesn’t work on iPhone X. Songs won’t pause and I have to force close the app for the music to stop playing. Going over to amazon prime music since I already pay for prime membership.
if i type in a song i want it doesnt give me that track it gives me a playlist full of random songs. HOW DORS THIS WORK??
I love pandora so much
I have been a pandora user for over 10 years and a paying subscriber for about 5. The current app is so buggy and unimproved for so long that I have almost stopped using pandora and may cancel my subscription due to the poor functionality. Updates seem to be released all the time but functionality never improves. The app is still not optimized for the new iPhone and currently my player will not pause. I can open and play something but the music will not pause unless I force quit the app. This makes me really sad as I have been a longtime supporter of pandora and the music genome project and what they’ve done for internet radio, but I’m reaching the point where I can’t justify the cost for such an inconsistent service with such frankly useless updates. I hope improvements come soon.. 
Pandora you guys are AMAZING
Great music. All the best artists.
My 3 yr old daughter loves pandora! Holiday stations, kid stations, and especially Taylor “Switch” stations!😍
Still love Pandora.. still free and amazing! 🤯 
What happened to “tired of this track” and “add variety”? Also where are the lyrics? This update just took out features, and rearranged the remaining features I was used to. It now takes twice as long to connect to the chromecast because they hide the chromecast icon. Thanks for making a once pleasurable paid music experience a frustrating one. 
The play/pause button isn’t working at all. Once a song pauses for some random reason hope your done listening to it, because the only way you can get more music to play is to forward to the next song or pick a new station.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Like most things the first season is the best. Ads were minimal and I don't care that they are more frequent now but why do the ads have to be louder and clearer than the music?
Why I am I not able to stream on my series 3 Apple Watch while on my cellular line.
This app is awesome even with the free version it’s the best music app out there by a long shot
Best App ever
Never had a problem with it before. Used it in my car and at home, loved it. Recently it stopped working. The app opens but nothing plays and it doesn’t register me hitting the play button. I’m paying for the ad-free, but not anymore. Cancelling my subscription and trying other music streaming apps. Not going to pay for something I can’t use.
This station “ Navidad Boriqua Radio”, brought back so many memories of the Christmas Holidays I spent as a child with my family at my grandparents house! Thank you Pandora!
You take it for granted when one of your most-used apps just work. Makes it really rough when they don’t. A few bugs: 1- Bluetooth no longer works. Headphones or car, both won’t play music. Sometimes it will play a few seconds and it seems to get the metadata, but the music stops.  2- Wired connection produces the same results 3- Music stops intermittently on Sonos.   I hope they fix things soon or I’ll be moving on to another music app. 
Sneaky pop up message for update ended up upgrading subscription not the app, charging much more per month. Worst is so far impossible to adjust back to lower subscription- app sends me to App Store which offers no such adjustments. Thievery and sneaky, bad business. Extremely disappointed long time subscription user.
Update.  The app has developed issues with background play and lack of response to Apple and Bose wired headphone controls. This has been going on too long with no advices to subscribers of a work around and obviously no fix.   Maybe the company could spend less time trying to sell to XM and attend to your customer issues.  For me, I’ll be switching.   Sad to see a once great service lose its way.    I have used Pandora for 3 years and always will.  It is a wonderful service that just works.  I like all things Apple, but am glad to continue to pay for Pandora even as the Apple radio features improve.  I use "Radio" as the native Mac app to play Pandora without browser.  Could be a better UI for it, but that's not Pandora.  Still Looking on that end.  Pandora though, great! 
Love it I always use it everyday!!! 👍🏻👍🏻
Like the many, many options for music.
I hear what I like... when I like...:)
I love it! The best!
I’m not sure why but this latest version crashes a lot. Sometimes the app crashes, sometimes my entire phone crashes while using this app. I can count on it crashing when combining it with Runkeeper, which is unfortunate because I used to like both these apps but it’s becoming more trouble than it’s worth.

With the newest update, it fixed the problem of Pandora quitting as I locked my phone or switched to another app.  Unfortunately, on the lock screen, it doesn’t show the specific songs that are playing. It just shows Pandora’s logo. No name of the song scrolling across like normal.  I’m glad it’s playing again, though, so now I can use it. 
I pay for the monthly service. Now I have to uninstall it because it keeps playing in the background and won\'t turn off. It just starts randomly. I have tried hard resets, updates, changing stations then pausing it, closing the app... Nothing works.

So I really love Pandora but for about a week now I open it up but it doesn't do anything. It just shows me the blue 'P' for Pandora and that's it. Help!!  UPDATE: never mind, I just redownloaded it again. 
Used pandora for years. With latest update pause button does nothing: have to close whole app to stop play. Unacceptable. Fix it.
This new update is really making me question my subscription!!! I can’t lock my phone because then I have to close and restart the app. The song will start playing and after about 10 seconds it will just freeze. Considering just paying for a different music provider.
When connecting to Bluetooth it lags and speeds up for no reason. iPhone 8 user... annoying disconnect from car Bluetooth. App was working great before the update
I just downloaded this and I’m already displeased. You know how you create stations? I created a Hamilton station and it barely even played actual Hamilton songs amongst other stations I have that barely play songs it should either. If you’re supposed to add songs to the station it’s really hard to find out. If I want to listen to 3 musicals I wanna listen to those three and not any others!

I've had Pandora Premium for a couple of months, and time and time again I have to download the same songs to listen to while offline. I travel a lot and it's such an inconvenience to have to download them over and over again. When I select "shuffle downloaded songs", it goes into auto play after two songs. Not worth the $12.99. Even with the latest update.
The app is awesome i love that you can use it while off the app and while using other apps. It’s my go to because of that. The only problem I have though is that the pause and play button doesn’t work. When I first open the app the music doesn’t start when I press play and I have to skip the song to get the music started on the next song. And if I go back to the app to pause it it doesn’t stop the music and I have to close the app to stop it. Please fix it!!!!!!

I love this app it’s way better then spotafiy so keep up the good work
I wish this app didn’t crash every other song. For the last few months on two different phones it has been unusable for me. Just updated to most recent version that says it addresses crashing, same issue. Seems ad-related (punishment for free users?) I put so much time into thumbs over the years it makes me sad. Amazon music via prime is a great alternative now. No issues with them!
I pay monthly for this and now they have “commercials” for the artists that break in my peaceful listening time. Beyond that, the stations under Jazz or guitar, etc. cross genre to music I’ve thumbed up in other genres. Come on! When I want smooth jazz, I want smooth jazz. When I want flamingo guitar, I want flamingo guitar! When I want Frank Sinatra I don’t want smooth jazz... is that too much to ask?  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I don’t know what happened but all of a sudden I’m paying $12 a month for premium and all I remember doing was updating my app I was happy with before which was ad free listening!! Such a scam, now I have to figure out how to go back!! Thanks for the waste of time.
Crashes every time I use it. Plays a few songs then crashes the whole phone. Even after the last several updates there have been no improvements
I have the free version and it works great. It has a very decent selection of stations.
Now that I have an Apple Watch I basically lost control of Pandora. The Controls won’t work, you can’t pause it, play it anything on the phone. Once the screen closes out on the phone your music turns off. Before you could lock your phone and keep listening. You have to look for the app on your phone now, just to turn the music back on. Totally a pain in the A**! Fix or I will have to cancel my service!!
All my favorite tunes!!!
This new update is complete trash. The options on my home screen don’t work I have to unlock my phone to change song. On top of that I have to constantly close and open the app because it gets really quiet. I’ve had this app since it came out and this is terrible.
Updated and now the pause button wont work on iPhone X I have to kill the app in order for it to stop playing. VERY FRUSTRATING!
U guys rock!!! My everyday!
I am not sure what happened but on both mine and my husband's phone Pandora app will not open. It will act like it's opening but then it will crash and force close. I've tried un-downloading it and that didn't do anything. I've restarted my phone and that doesn't help.  I prefer to listen to music when I workout so I had to download a different music app which I really didn't want to do because I love Pandora.  Please if anyone has any suggestions.  **new review**  Absolutely terrible. When connected to my car through Bluetooth it will not display what song is playing on my phone or car screen. When I shut off my car it will automatically play on my phone.  I don’t know why this happens every few updates but it’s getting more annoying than it is to pay for this app. Also when first opening the app the first song never plays. I either have to close the app and reopen or use repeat or skip the song. 
I love Pandora so much. I will always choose pandora over any other music app. I love that you can mix different styles into one playlist. My only wish is that it was possible to make multiple mixed playlists, so that I can have a pumped up playlist as well as a relaxing mixed playlist. I also love the thumbprint radio and the fact that the stations constantly update and change based on what you like, dislike, and what new music is available. Great app!
Your app keeps crashing and freezing up my phone7, 1 out of every 3 times I use it! Was considering paying for it, but not like this.
Pandora is no longer reliable! Use it for an alarm clock and half the time, it freezes between the auto shut-off for 15-30 minutes before going to bed and the alarm to music in the morning. About 20-30% of the time it simple doesn’t wake me, the remainder I get some alarm bells. It doesn’t work properly with my vehicle anymore, which t worked seamlessly for 2+ years. It stays on after I walk away from the car, it doesn’t automatically turn back on when I get in the car. And, this was a vehicle it worked with seamlessly for a very long time. Very frustrating!!
I play like 5 songs and I will shut my phone down and reboot the whole thing
I have stopped using pandora because of the crashes. It still doesn’t work right. I’m really disappointed. I have an iPhone 6S and despite the fact that they claim to fix the issue. It’s still crashing. I would give zero stars if I could.
Ill be in the middle of a song and it will suddenly stop playing and jump to another song. And some times it will happen 3 or more times in a row.? It gets very frustrating and makes me want to quit with Pandora all together. Would rather waste space downloading a song to my music file then use this app any more.
Look, I love this service. But without fail, 5 songs in, the app crashes, and I have to restart my phone.

App keeps crashing. It turns off and restarts my phone. It did it with my iPhone 6 and again with my iPhone 7!
So after I listen to about 3 songs it stops the song and force quits. It force quits to where I have to type in my phone password to open my phone again. This happens EVERY. SINGLE.

All you get is ads. Waste of time.
I’ve had pandora for a while. And ever since I got the iPhone 6s it hasn’t worked like it did when I had the iPhone 5 and now it crashes every 2 hours. Also starts to power down my phone then crashes or when I hook Bluetooth to my phone pandora freezes and I have to close the app and restart it every time I get in my truck.
This app used to be my favorite music app, but now every time I use it, it crashes when it’s on the 5th or 6th song. I give it one star because it’s so irritating! Update 12/09/17, I have updated the app which I thought helped, but as I was typing this, it actually crashed and I had to start this rating over again. Also after the update, the majority of the advertisements were in Spanish. I speak English, so once again, frustrating. Side note: I actually deleted this app months ago because of the volume of religious ads. Religion is a choice and shouldn’t be forced on anyone. I recently added it back, only to have it crash constantly. I am now deleting it forever as it is too frustrating!
Pandora is the station I go to always on line!
Best music ever
First off, the app is a lot more stable than it was before. However, now the pause button isn't working, both from within the app and on the lock screen. I have to quit the app to stop the music from playing. Also, no information, whatsoever, is displayed on the lock screen when playing music. No artist name, no song title, no album artwork, not even the track length.
I can’t even listen to it. Can we please fix?
To many crashes even with the new update😡..!!!
UPDATE: most recent update did not fix the issue, it is apparent that the developers are not listening to us, I guess I will be cancelling.  I’ve been a paying pandora user for years...Pandora now on IOS 11.1.2 on the iPhone X is terrible. I cannot get it to play nice anymore with Bluetooth audio in my vehicle. It doesn’t want to play music, if I can get it to work it will only play one song then stop, and then I have to restart it all over again. Maybe if I could disable accessory mode the problem would be solved, but nope can’t do that either.   Get on your game or I’ll be cancelling my paid subscription and demanding some money back. 
This app crashes so much it's annoying! The app also plays songs on stations that aren't in the same or similar genre of the type of music on a particular station. I guess I'll just cancel my subscription and use Spotify instead!!!
Never really had an issue but with the most recent update my music fast forwards by its self. I have to pause the song to get it to play right. Even when I pause it the song will play for about 30 seconds and start fast forwarding again. This happens on every station.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for the trouble you are experiencing.

Awesome station
Everything’s great except the ads They play some pretty good stuff when you look for a band along with what you looked for 
The app has been crashing/freezing and there has been multiple updates to “fix” the crashes and after each update, no corrections have been done and crashes and freezing is still occurring....thinking of deleting app and going to #Spotify
Pandora, with its timer and vast musical selections, was part of my bedtime routine. Now the moment I switch to another app, the music stops playing. If this isn’t fixed by end of month, I’ll unsubscribe (after 5years). Update: tech support got back to me the day after my first review. Just reloaded, and the app once again works like a charm!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble.

The most recent update from maybe September/ October I think, has terribly destroyed the quality of Pandora’s functionality. I’ve never had any issues from Pandora until the past two months on a very frequent bases to the point I just opted for Apple’s student music subscription. It crashes multiple times in the middle of songs causing my phone to go black and then requiring me to type my passcode to get into my phone. It proceeds with reopening and starting the song that was interrupted over. This takes place at least five to six times throughout the day if I listen to Pandora the entire day and three times if it just for a few hours sometimes minutes. Since— I’ve had four other updates: to fix bugs, malfunctioning or anything else effecting the app. That has not helped a bit Pandora. I recommend you all look into this bug. 🙃  Also: Ads/ Commercials  I’ve had Pandora for like five plus years now. I can go on YouTube at times and go through videos as free of ads. Pandora has gotten to the point that I’ve literally been experiencing two ads every other song. Some days they’re good and I rarely have any ads, but barely. This past week had been soooooo annoying. More commercials than music now. It wasn’t like this at first. Pandora is declining drastically. 
I’ve updated, but it still crashes just once every time I use the app.. at least it plays the same song when I go back on it, but it’s still annoying
A couple years ago Pandora was not bad. In the last several months I’ve noticed a severe increase in commercials. And now in the past few days I’m getting random songs playing outside my genre. Twice today it happened. I’m about to remove the Pandora app and get my music elsewhere.
I don’t like the new update I can’t talk or comment to friends anymore rather with the old version I could
I Iove pandora or at least I did but once I upgraded now it doesn’t work properly I can’t pause my music and and it’ll turn off if I exit the screen. Hope they fix it cause if they don’t I’m finding another app to listen to music  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble.

Great app for a good playlist of music, just needs iPhone X support! PLEASE!
Pandora knows me!!
GET PANDORA ITS GREAT but this most recent update won't let me do anything on Pandora at all I loved being able to listen to all my favorite music. I just with that you please fix this issue with putting on music. 
Pay 12.99 monthly for a subscription i can’t even access anymore because it constantly crashes. use to be decent but still pricy just to create your own playlist.

Pandora Plus is absolutely worth the small fee per month or paid annually in advance. No regrets at all. Keep rocking pandora Plus!!
I’m experiencing many glitches with app :( music will stop playing randomly, App crashes and gets stuck on either pause or play. PLEASEEEE FIX!! I love Pandora but I’m not liking these glitches :((
The songs make me dance and sing   . It has my fav songs and it will have yours too 😜👍🏼. 
App crashes frequently. Please fix
Tracks before crashing entire phone..
In brief:  -As soon as you open the app, it starts playing music. Particularly annoying in a workplace environment.  -Not intuitive when it comes to downloads. Is it currently downloading?  Is it done?  Feedback is not there.  I kicked off a download, it appeared to be done but when I went to go listen to it later off-line, it wasn't there.  -Repeats tracks a lot. Repeat on or off, doesn't matter.  -Menu navigation is weak. One example is that you have to hit "cancel" in the search option to get back to a menu.  This is not the app's fault, but some material is not available for download or playing outright due to licensing issues.  You can only kick off a station based on the album/artist. That's disappointing after spending some time searching and then finally finding what you want.  UPDATE 8-Dec:  I think the repeat problem has been fixed.  However, sometimes it continues to play music after I unplug my phone from my car stereo. Pause button doesn't work. Sometimes closing the app doesn't stop it!  Really annoying.  Also, sometimes my car stereo won't let me skip tracks. It does nothing or sometimes my head unit displays 'skip limit reached', which is lame because I'm a paid subscriber. 
Not only does this app that I’ve been happily using for years crash every time i open it, it now crashes my entire phone once it does start “working” for a few songs. It got so bad that I bought a new phone thinking that was the issue. Brand new phone, same exact issues. Frequently I also find myself locked out of my phone because it freezes my lock screen. I’ve been using the pandora app for years on my phone and I’ve been a loyal pandora user for 15 years and this is by far the worst it’s ever been.
Since the new update I can no longer pause a song and it also will just randomly stop playing a song if go into another app...  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble.

I’ve been using Pandora since before Apps, back when it was known as the music genome project.  Overall very happy with them.  My biggest problem as of lately has forced me to write a review.  The app no longer lets me pause my music forcing me to close it any time I want to pause, it is clearly a software glitch.  Furthermore, I can’t skip songs at all unless I am inside the app, I can’t change volume from the time it is opened unless I close it and reopen it, it only is working off my data and not through my wifi which caused me to get overage charges this past month.  This is regardless of whether I am on wifi...  The list goes on and the updates and bug fixes take way to long to come.  Unfortunately I am now having to change to using Spotify because it has real software support and usability.
Great music! Just need less commercials
The most recent updates have been horrible.  The prior version would only play when the app was in the foreground.  The update that came out two days ago fixed that issue, but now you can’t resume a song of it is paused by any other app or incoming call.  I’m constantly having to relaunch the app.  Get your act together pandora or I’ll be canceling my subscription.
I have to force quit the app to stop it. I hit pause, icon changes, music just goes on and on. My other gripe is shutting off my Bluetooth headphones causes it to play on phone speaker. Apple app stops when the Bluetooth device shuts off. iPhone 6s latest iOS 11. UPDATE: music stops in app, not lock screen and once you attempt with lock screen music can’t be stopped without force-kill.
Love that I can listen to what I’m in the mood for whenever I want.

Crashes my phone every time I use it. Plays a commercial after every song. My "Hard Rock Radio" only knows 4 groups.
I love it
Pandora is more of an advertisement, I barley listen to any music.
Get ads about every 2 songs seriously. I used to love pandora but I think I'm done and move on to another service. The new updates have been terrible, if I close the app for second when a song is paused it closed completely and I lose the song I was listening too. This is just the beginning of all the problems. All the ads make it unlistenable at this point. I was planning on signing up for a music service this new year and can tell you it won't be pandora. Just a hint playing an ad constantly doesn't make me want to pay for your premium service, it makes me want to delete your app!
It asks me to link to my Facebook account *every* time it loads. Music sometimes will play after loading, sometimes it will require me to kill the app and start again. Very frustrating. Once it gets going it’s generally fine, but I have to do this stupid dance with it every time I start the app. Incredibly frustrating.
So. Many. Ads! And to boot it freezes and shuts down my entire phone once a day. Without fail I'll have listened to 20min of music and 40 min of ads THEN comes the black screen of death then the phone spinning sign like it's shutting down then just back to home It's horrible. 
Great selection of music. Whatever you like to listen. They have it, and you will not be disappointed. I put on Pandora anytime of the day.
The stations don’t even work they crash after a couple of skips and then have to wait hours to start again.
Getting to be more and more adds every day! If I wanted to listen to commercials, I’d turn on the radio!
Do not press “thumbs up” otherwise that’s all it will play I swear! I don’t hear anything new on my Pandora
I liked the app in the past. But after iOS 11 release the app started randomly crashing from time to time. There were a number of updates since iOS 11 release and the issue is still not fixed. I don’t believe the issue is isolated to only my iPhone 6s. Please fix this already.
My favorite music app. I try others but always come back.
I have used pandora for many years in addition to paying for pandora one. I love the simplicity and overall use of pandora, but I have never managed to have pandora on any phone without it having issues. The previous update caused music to stop playing after about 30 seconds keeping you from being able to use the app at all, very frustrating when I use it on a daily basis for hours at work. Now this new update has fixed the previous issue, but won’t even allow me to pause the music (even after reinstalling the app). This is on top of minor issues the app has had for a long time like crashes and sound issues that I’ve been willing to ignore.  Constant issues have left me with nothing but disappointment in pandora which is unfortunate because I’ve loved the app for so many years. I love the idea of the app, but the experience over the past year has been terrible. I wouldn’t recommend it at this point in time. 
Outstanding station
Great listening
I’ve updated this app EVERY TIME and my iPhone has iOS 11.1 BUT THE BUG-whenever a song plays, the app crashes and restarts my phone. PLEASE FIX BC I LOVE PANDORA!

Constantly crashes and resets my phone. Ads every other song. They make the free version so bad that it almost forces you to pay for premium.
Can’t pause after last update.
Trying to update the App on my I-phone for over 4 days. Pandora does not download. Tried to cancel my subscription— cannot do it over the phone!! What sort of customer service is this??  Please get in touch with me— need to cancel Shyam Sethi 
I was listening to Christmas music and in the middle of run run Rudolph I was interrupted by an add. Right in the middle of a song but other than that it is a very fast and efficient app.
It it ok it doesn't do good on no wifi
Hands down the poorest functioning app on my phone. It fails mid song and then I have to reopen it only for it to start that exact song over. I’m surprised Pandora is shittier than some of the one-off designer games. You’re better than that pandora...or at least so I thought.
I paid a lot of money for Pandora and now I can’t skip songs with Bluetooth. Pressing two times does not skip forward. Pressing three times does not skip back. Pressing once doesn’t even stop the song.

I loved (note loved NOT love) Pandora. Ever since the new iPhone update, Pandora is a disaster. Every so often it will just stop.  When you check the phone you have to sign in with the phones passcode. When you restart Pandora you listen to the same program at least 5 minutes in the past. Sometimes it just locks up. I get advertisements for the paid subscription to sign up and I am already signed up. PLEASE PANDORA. FIX YOUR APP!!!!
I use and love pandora over other streaming services. The selection is good and diverse and it does well to learn your likes and dislikes, if you’re willing to hit the like and dislike buttons. The ads are ads. Fm/am Radio is still way worse. The one really frustrating thing about pandora, however, that on my iPhone and my wife’s and one every iPhone user I consult pandora likes to throw a temper tantrum every once in awhile and force quit. This force quit also reboots the phone and kills the battery by 15-30%. I go from listen to music with 45% battery to a reboot, no music and 20% battery with no warning. Please fix this issue. If it weren’t for the rage quitting I’d rate pandora at 5 stars.
A week ago the app completely broke, I don’t remember if an update broke the app or if it just suddenly began to act up.  At first, it would fade out/stop working if the app lost focus or if the phone was locked (like YouTube)  Since then there has been an update, and now the pause button is functionally useless. It will highlight when I press it, but it doesn’t work. Yet I can change stations or even skip.  Sometimes, because the app also now has a tendency to crash and be totally unresponsive. So the only way to pause at all is to kill the program. Even pulling headphones from the jack dosnt always work. (That was a pleasant surprise in class) it switches seamlessly to playing from the speaker.  At least it lets me lock my phone to save some battery now.... 
The most obtrusive ads I've ever seen in an app, trying to push me into spending fifty bucks a year....or just push me away.  Update: I finally caved a couple of years ago and subscribed, but I’ve just cancelled my subscription because the app has been broken for the past two update cycles.  First, Pandora would close as soon as it lost focus...so I could listen as long as I plugged in my phone, didn’t let it sleep, and didn’t otherwise use my phone.  That’s now fixed, but now the only way to stop music that’s playing is to force-close the app.  NOT OKAY in a premium app!  Now, with my subscription ended, the ads have started rolling in, frequently and obnoxiously.  I’m off to Spotify’s radio feature, which works properly without harassing me to upgrade every few hours, and plays more variety of music to boot. 
Officially giving up on Pandora. Never works first try. Never. Always close and then open again. Crashes at least 2x during workouts. Not just an app crash. Makes my entire phone crash. Today was last straw as it crashed during my sprint. Goodbye Pandora.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Love this app and the new features!  Offline mode was great add for me since I drive out of cell coverage often.   The latest update seems to have a bug - the pause button doesn’t work. I need to kill the app to get it to stop playing.  Edit: uninstall/reinstall fixed it!   Back to five stars! 
I drive 1 hour to work and 1 hour back every day. This usually means I listen to pandora for, at the very least, 2 hours a day. Usually more. However, I’m deleting off my phone as it constantly crashes and takes my car stereo with it. Total crap. Do NOT download this app.

Without touching my phone Pandora will start playing music. I can’t stop it either because the app isn’t open so I have to mute the volume or turn my phone off. Also, if I intentionally open the app the first song will play for about 5-7 seconds and then the app will shut off. The latest version is quirky.
Omg never have had so many crashes in this app i have started using other apps because this one has lost its perfection
Despite updating to the latest version that is supposed to help stop the app from crashing, it still won’t play more than 2.5 songs without crashing on my iPhone X. Rendering this app useless until they can fully fix it.
Why the hell has pandora Started messing up?! Ive used this app for more than 10 years and ever since the update it closes on its own, freezes my phone.

Pandora is either really good or really bad. I’ll open it and the songs are fire one after the next and the next they all are random songs that don’t even correlate to their station. For example I downloaded Pink radio because ya know, wanted to listen to Pink. 2 of her songs came on in between two other random songs played that were not Pink. After the second song of hers finished, it was a complete shuffle of the most random and unrelated songs to Pink Radio. Kelly Clarkson, Taylor Swift, Tina Turner, Carrie Underwood... Carrie Underwood? They’re completely different genres of music, how are they on the same station. So I obviously skipped. I skipped 25 songs before I was out of skips, not even until I got to the next Pink song.. with my unlimited listening hour. Long story short, Pandora’s efforts to match songs to the specified station or genre or artist is absolute trash. Why is it so hard to play Pink songs on Pink radio? I will never understand the inability..
Great time playing with the music I love. Get this, I'm 68 years old and like the deep house with a splay of R & B, old Motown ... So far so good. Still learning the thumbs/down.😍.
Life saver for anyone. Moms, dads, teens, toddlers, everyone
Latest version has been amazingly buggy and pretty much unusable.  Does Pandora have a QA team or is the public their QA process ?  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for the trouble you are experiencing.

After reading some of the other reviews, I’ve seen people having similar problems. When I’m using the app I am completely unable to pause the music. I am able to skip songs, but only by entering the app and pressing the skip button several times, meaning from the lock screen I am unable to skip or pause songs. The display actually doesn’t even register that a song is playing, only that pandora is running. As the title suggests, all of these issues began with the most recent update and I hope that they are fixed soon. Pandora used to work very well, which is why I gave an extra star, but all the problems now are very frustrating.  EDIT: These issues only appear to be present when stations are set to shuffle. 
I love Pandora premium perks: my thumbs up playlist downloaded, off-line listening, no commercials, ability to search for anything I want, whole albums down loaded! It's the best!
This app is no longer compatible with my 2013 Honda Accord, not with using the Pandora app in my car or even just connecting over bluetooth. I used to be able to access my playlists, see the title/artist/album of each track, even so thumbs up or down with my car interface, but it no longer functions with the newer updates to the app. Spotify works seamlessly - maybe I’ll change my subscription if this doesn’t get resolved.
Pandora la pionera y la mejor apesar de todas las competencias..!

I've been enjoying pandora for many years now, and it never disappoints. Don't get the premium because the ads are 30 seconds max. The skip limit also is not a problem because it forces you to enjoy more of your favorite artist. I will always use pandora to listen to music
Man seriously!!!!
❤️❤️❤️
The app is crashing like every 20 minutes
Love the app
Been a premium subscriber for almost 10 years.  Builds over the last year have been horribly buggy and even a month after iPhone X and iOS 11 releases, still doesn’t fill the screen.  Crashes all the time, especially in background.  I’ve been holding on on switched to Spotify due to Pandora’s recommendation engine but the quality of developer work has gone way downhill.  Hire me and I’ll fix all these problems for you!
Since installing pandora I’ve noticed that my iPhone will shut down and restart randomly while playing music. I thought maybe it was just an issue with the latest iOS update. But now I notice this only happens when using pandora. I deleted the app for about a week and didn’t have any crash/restart issues. This appears to only be an issue with the app itself. I think I’ll delete it until this is resolved
The app crashes at least twice a day — just stops for no reason and I have to reboot it back up. Takes a lot of happiness out of my experience. Particularly irritating when it happens during a song I’m really jamming to.
Very cumbersome to use and don\'t find the song I need  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing. Please feel free to reach out to our support team directly for assistance: http://pdora.co/AppReview 
I can’t use this piece of manure you folks put out. I can’t play, pause, or do much with this app unless I stop it and relaunch it and relaunch it again. This is not what I expect for my money.
Every time there is an update for the app it’s seems to get worse.  My pause button has stopped working and now i have to close the app just to stop the music.  It is crash after crash.  I am about to cancel my subscription it’s a joke.
For boasting such a large music library, you would think Pandora could come up with more that 25 songs it would think I’d like. It also will play a song different from what is displayed as the album art and in a completely different genre. These issues seem exclusive to the app.
The best access to music!
This app for some reason crashes now each time I use it. The music will stop, then I will hear my iPhone beep and the screen will have the passcode screen to unlock the phone. When you open the app up again it will replay the song that was playing when it crashed from the beginning.  Extremely annoying when it crashes when I’m in the shower.  Used this app for years and it worked great up until about 2 months ago.
Does not work in Trinidad 👎🏾
I hate that I can’t even listen to 3 songs with out it crashing and restarting my phone! I can’t even change my music when I have it in lock nor pause it! So disappointed!
Recently there was ANOTHER update and it still fails to stay running. The crashing is getting old. Considering moving on from this app.
I pay for ad free and for replay ability and my app crashes each and every day. I have submitted over a dozen tickets for this issue and the only response I have been given is “this issue is being looked into by our engineers”.
I love pandora radio! It gives you all the songs you love for free.
When will it will be IOS 11 compatible? Many issues since IOS 11 came out. Have to force quit Pandora all the time. When i plug into my JEEP Uconnect System via USB, have to force quit Pandora and launch it again to work.  Over Bluetooth in my car, the only way to get to work is to start streaming before i start my car.
To many adds and premium is to much not worth it
Every time I click on a song or try to click shuffle it just pauses the song I was listening to.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Yeap, me too, always a loyal pandora Client.  Albeit, as of the last few updates, it doesn’t stay reliably connected to my car stereo, a stock Dodge unit.  Have to jack with it to get it to work consistently now. Sometimes, because I’m driving, I give up !!  This has always worked flawlessly in the past, what gives ?  Also, if using my AirPods, and I take the AirPods out of my ears, pandora just keeps playing using the phone speakers.  This NEVER happened before. I have to kill the app to get it to stop, a real pain.  Guess my car problems are solved, I’ve gone back to Sirius radio now.
Still no iPhone X support. Pandora is lagging behind other developers.
This app requires a lot of closing out and restarting... This is obnoxious.
Pandora used to work great via Bluetooth and now it won’t connect at all! On top of that it won’t let me pause music!! And when the car shuts off it’s still playing instead of pausing!! Super frustrated and ready to delete !
Let us make a custom playlist of specific songs and then you'll get 5 stars also plz update the app to work with the iphone X i can’t press play or pause in the lock screen on my phone
If the Review pop-up would stop popping up now every 15 seconds, I would have rated better.  Oh well, don't bother me!
Used to love it, but with the recent updates it has been super buggy..it causes my phone to freeze up. When I turn it on, I have to reset it about twice to get the music to actually play sound. If I’m using it at the same time as maps, it causes my phone to freeze and reset, which is insanely stressful and annoying when I’m in the middle of navigating where to drive. I’ve given up entirely and just use iheartradio or Spotify.
Yeah it would be nice if you updated the app to support the screen size of the iPhone X. Pandora has had a few updates since the launch of the iPhone X, but still looks terrible since there are large black gaps on the top and bottom. Other apps from smaller companies added support within a few days. What’s the hold up Pandora?
Every update introduces more bugs. Don’t update. Now when I pause it won’t restart without me skipping to the next song. Plus it still crashes randomly. I’m on an iPhone 8 this should simply not happen.
Pandora always knows what I want to hear! Love it!
Love pandora, & the play backs now .
Still does not work. Can’t use the play, pause or stop functions.
Time to start looking for another music streaming app.
What the hell happened nothing works I have no control over what I am listening to ????
They need to figure out these new issues quickly. I have already switched to primarily using another music app because of all the crashes that make it impossible to listen to even just one song. If the issue continues I may just delete Pandora all together, which is sad because it has been my music provider for nearly a decade and has all my favorite playlists saved. I would love to stick with it, but when a music app doesn’t play music then what’s the point?
Luv Pandora!
I use pandora everyday and it constantly crashes now and force shuts off and make my iPhone look like it’s turning off (black screen with a loading circle in the middle) then I have to restart the app
Has been power cycling lately even after updates
WHAT THE HECK IS THIS YOU TOOK AWAY COMMENT SECTION AND PERSONAL PROFILES FOR WHAT ????? JEEEZZ IDIOTS
I’ve been using Pandora for years now, and it continues to surprise me. The more you tailor a station with thumbs up/down feedback, the better and better it becomes. Pandora has exposed me to so much great music I probably would never have discovered otherwise.
After down loading the new update, my phone and tablet starting crashing, I completely removed it and reinstalled it on  both on devices, very unstable app.
So easy to use and love the variety of music!
It’s okay could be better like less interceptions
Love all the options, music and site!! It’s easy to use and fun ! Love it !! Revi L 
It still occasionally freezes and doesn’t work in the lock screen. Doesn’t show what song you’re listening to or allow you to change it from the lock screen anymore. But hey, at least the app is playing music again.  Edit* Can’t pause the music at all. On the app or in the lock screen.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Great music choice, I enjoyed it he whole ride.
I do not know what they did as the app use to work flawlessly.  Now Pandora causes my iPhone 7 to get hot which it never did before and it causes my phone to shut down to black and reboot.  I looked and there doesn’t seem to be anyway to send a question or report to Pandora.  This is extremely frustrating. Every time I open the app it loads like I had it in the background, stays frozen causing me to have to close it and open again.  Then a few songs in it’ll reboot my phone. Not to mention I get the same 2 ads and Pandora will now randomly pay 10 mins of ads in a row. 
Love love saves me every day!! Don't know what id do without it :) couldn't get thru the day without pandora
My brother doing thing less get it Kd
I used to love this app but now I hate it. It’s riddled with bugs and I can barely listen to a song without it crashing. If you have an iPhone I strongly recommend switching to Apple Music or another music app
Used to be good but greed took over too many ads $@&! Pandora
I was expecting to hear more Elvis  Christmas music when I choose music by him. I love Christmas music but some singers I'm not fond of -- so Elvis is my preference today!!!
Raised the rating Pandora is working on DirecTV again as long as it’s a genie or higher. Shame I don’t think it’s ever going to come back to the legacy DVR‘s🙏🏽 I hope it does. Just seems like since August and iOS 11 update a lot of apps have a lot more ads than they ever used to. It’s really disturbing trend and it’s not just Pandora. For some reason if you have it i7 or lower do A sync back up with your laptop and quality lightning jack cable, seems like the phones will act less glitchy after I did that. But I really have to say iOS 11 and Apple want you to get the newer phones I8/i10  And it’s been having a devastating effect on DirecTV Pandora first 5 or 6 months ago. Now it’s even affecting the genies DirecTV says there’s some sort of corporate battle going on I can’t believe it Direct Tv AT&T just buy these idiots and make it better

Horrible. Freezes like never before and won’t re connect. Also not updated to fit iPhone X screen. Cmon pandora, get it together!
I love pandora listen to it all the time definitely worth it just wish the music was louder than the ads
Updated to the most recent version and app is STILL crashing! Please fix!!
For the past few months, every time I use Pandora for more than 10 minutes, the app crashes. There have been several updates since the issue first came to light, but even though each update has “reduced crashes,” it hasn’t helped on my device. I have an iPhone 7 Plus, which has software that is up-to-date, yet the problem persists. I will have to find a new music app if this continues, because not only is it frustrating but dangerous as well (it happens often while driving).  Please, please, please fix this issue, Pandora. 
When listening to music on the app, after a while, it decides to stop playing and exits and I have to then go back and open the app again. Then it starts over the entire song that was JUST PLAYING. It has happened since the latest app update. Please fix this bug. Huge pandora fan but this is just annoying a bit. Thank you.
Pandora is a great music app
Since Apple has upgraded their iOS (and I have done so religiously) Pandora has gotten worse. Skipping, going dead, not transmitting song info to my cars Audio data display, I could go on and on......hey Pandora Fix your app, right now SPOTIFY looks real good.
Content filter is broken. Hard to use for me anymore. Would love to see this get fixed.
Just updated and now my Pandora isn’t working. :(  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing. Please feel free to reach out to our support team directly for assistance: http://pdora.co/AppReview 
I have to close the app and reopen it every time after a phone call. The music doesn’t automatically start back playing when I hang up and non of the buttons work to try and start it again.
I use pandora all the time, in my home, in the car, at work. I have the explicit lyrics turned off and all of sudden without warning I find out it’s not working.  How embarrassing to be playing music and to start hearing curse words. I have reported it to them, and they said they are aware and was trying to fix it!  But this has not been fixed! So now I have to only listen to certain station to try to limit what might slip through. Please get this problem fixed!
Ok I love it!!!
Too many commercials and too expensive for paid service   I would bite at $5/mo

The reason why I gave it a 2 star rating is because sometimes it doesn’t work and buffer all the time and I think I should skip much as I want w/o a charge
I’m switching to Spotify because Pandora plays the same few songs over and over again. What’s really ridiculous is the hoops I have to go through to cancel my subscription! Apple should be ashamed that they make it so easy to pay but make it next to impossible to unsubscribe.
I wish they would play more of the artist you selected. They stray away and don’t come back often enough for me.
In the last 3 versions, it keeps crashing. No smooth music experience. Bahhh
It’s all good
I have loved Pandora for a very long time. However, the new updates are rendering it very buggy and almost unusable, still.   I can no longer pause music, to make it stop I have to close the app. I also can not see which song is playing on my phone’s lock screen anymore, nor can I pause it/skip from the lock screen. It just says “Pandora.”  At least it no longer stops playing after 30 seconds. Hopefully more fixes are coming. 
I was a big fan of Pandora when it first launched years ago, and I’ve used it for many years with great success.   I don’t know what they did to it, but in the last six months or so, no matter what updates they patch it with, you can’t listen to any music for more than 5 to 10 minutes without it crashing every single time. It’s incredibly frustrating. 
I’ve been enjoying Pandora since its introduction and I’ve been a paying customer pretty much since the beginning. But the last update killed everything I liked about this app. First, it crashes every second time I try to open it. Second, I can no longer turn display off without the music shut off, too (REALLY?? I PAY YOU A MONTHLY FEE AND I HAVE TO KEEP IT OPEN, CANT EVEN CHECK MY MESSAGES WHILE LISTENING TO MUSIC????). Third, when I try to re-open it after checking my emails (!!!!!) it crashes so badly I have to kill it and start all over. These are the biggest current screw ups, there are many smaller issues as well, I just don’t want to waste my time typing them all here.

Do you people just not bother testing anything before releasing?  Last version would only play with the phone unlocked.

Before, Pandora’s biggest issue was that you couldn’t watch videos to earn your skips.

Read the rest of the reviews. You will find multiple complaints about the app performance. Freezes. Doesn’t connect with Bluetooth. Randomly goes into offline mode. Etc. the Developers need to start putting the description of what they are attempting to fix under the release notes. Doing this allows your users to provide feedback. The general “bug fixes to improve performance” is such a crock. The last few updates you have pushed has only made the app worse!
Still no update for iPhone X?? Come on
Nice service, but be careful. You'll be offered a "free, 30-day trial for Pandora Plus." But then, you'll see a $4.99 charge to your Apple account and credit card on file. Can be tricky to cancel, too.
I have an iPhone (6s & now 8).  I used to listen to Pandora all the time while driving (2015 Honda CRV), but now Bluetooth connectivity is horrible.  Frequent adds and/or other issues prevent Pandora from working properly.  It’s actually made it dangerous trying to connect to Pandora while driving, to the point where I’ve given up.  This was never an issue before.
Love Love Love ‼️‼️ I listen to my favorites every night 😍

Pandora is cutting off when i open up Snapchat
So lately I Pandora has been crashing so much. There is not a hour or day that goes by without the app crashing. Its so annoying. Its literally the only music app I use and it crashes all the times -_____- Please fix. I love this app but Im starting to hate it..
The app is starting to go back to its old self (thank you for fixing the problem where the music would stop when the screen turns off) and everything is working smooth except for the pause button. The pause button doesn't work. I don't pause much but I would like to have the option that way I can talk to people and not be distracted by my music. It's a minor problem but if you have the time please fix it asap. Thanks!

Anytime I open Pandora, it plays 2-3 songs and then crashes and my phone restarts. Please fix, it is very annoying.
I really love pandora I get to listen to all the music I like
I love using Pandora whenever I need background noise for homework, but for some reason, at random points the song “record scratches” and then the app crashes. Not only that, my phone restarts and requires me to put in my password again. Somebody please fix this because I do *not* want to keep getting earraped, otherwise I’ll just go use a different music app.
There’s a bug. Whenever I open pandora for the first time and press play, it pauses immediately and refuses to stay on play. I have to force quit and reopen again, then it works. Thinking this was an isolated incident, I asked around and it’s happening to everyone, hence, the bug. U-P-D-A-T-E
I’ve used pandora for years and I love it I always find good music on here which is way I go back and forth from Apple music to pandora.. but there’s One thing.. iPhone X optimization would be awesome!!

Way too many adds, Iheart radio has less than half the amount of adds!
... but now the pause button doesn't work. Do they even QA this thing anymore?
Until recently the Pandora app was my go to on iPad. Since the iOS 11, it has gotten gradually worse, to the point of not even playing. This is pretty sad when I’m paying monthly for the service!!
Pandora is gud, I don’t know why there are so many h8rs. You can listen to a variety of songs that you like, and if yo ain’t likin all dat random crap you can get pandora premium or plus or sum crap. That will allow you to choose the songs ya wanna hear. See y’all later losers.
These bugs need to be fixed before Pandora loses another customer!  Lately, the app has been freezing and shutting down on me constantly. (Changed my review from 5 stars to 1.) Previous review: $5 a month to avoid those excessive ads isn't a bad deal! 
All the bad reviews about the app not working in the background and such... is false. Do what Pandora wants you to do.. and the app works flawlessly. Way to go Pandora!! Pandora is the greatest music app on planet Earth!!
Please optimize for new iPhone X screen
I love this app but it. Now
I pay 12.99 for crap it constantly shuts down it also erases my music and I'm unable to re download songs I had previously downloaded it's a joke of an app.
I love pandora but more of a mixture would be nice  it repeats a lot of the same songs in 1 station less ads and more selection. But good lol 💜
The most xlnt thing about Pandora is discovering new music.  Thank you, Pandora.
I use it mostly for just Christmas music so Pandora eventually caught on and just plays all things I generally like. 😊
I set my station to fall asleep to and turn on the sleep timer, but about 10 minutes go by and it stops and shuts down. Of course, this wakes me up. I thought the last update was supposed to fix this?!?! Not a happy camper!!!
So many apps for music still love Pandora best!!
The commercials are a distraction! The music is so good and just when I’m deep in  there is a commercial break. Almost like when watching a really good move and a commercial enters right something excited is about to be revealed. Love it though. Thanks Pandora, You “Rock”
For the most part I would rate this app / service 4* but... this version is terrible! Music will stop playing when you leave the app (to send and email or text). Pause button doesn’t work. If other apps use sound like navigation, sound pauses and can not be started again. I need to quit the app - re-launch... why am I paying for this???  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for the trouble you are experiencing - this is something we are actively looking into.

This app crashes several times a day. It’s been this way for a long time. So I don’t think it’ll be fixed any time soon.   Main reason to not get Pandora Premium. 
I’ve been a paying customer for years. I love(d) pandora and used it often.  iOS 11 came out, and the app is completely broken. I’m sure there was a change in the sdk, but it can’t be that hard to fix -come on.  I’m going to give it about another week, then forget about pandora... I only wish I could take my years of carefully curated music playlists with me. 
It’s awesome I love it I recommend it to everybody but the ads are ALWAYS play right when I don’t want them to other then that it’s amazing
Pandora Is the best service I have used for picking music that I like to listen to.
Es la mejor plataforma de música qué hay en el mundo
Y’all doing it right 😌❤️
Pandora is amazing although I wish there weren’t so many ads I understand why they do that. I recently found a relaxation station and it’s amazing thanks so very much!!! Don’t know what I’d do without it😀😀
I drive for a living....Pandora is a life saver. I listen to it from the time I clock in till the time I clock out. It’s like Ive been in my living room on my couch for 8hrs just chilling. Before I know it it’s time to clock out!!!!
This app has become almost useless since the last update. Please update again. I check every day hopeful for a fix, but nothing yet.
Perfect when you want to just put your phone down and listen to music.
Es lo mejor de todas las estaciones
Music helps me like service dogs help the handicapped.
Ms. SusyQ86 has nailed my complaints too. Been toying with leaving Pandora for good...there’s more choices now. I wish you would listen to us Tim, you’re getting ready to loose revenue over poor app design, integration testing and deployment being short cut. Just a guess sir!  Not taking much more nonsense. Respectfully, J.R. Young Do you have a clue as to how long I’ve been a supportive customer? 
More pop up ads than a 90s computer
My complaint is the same as SuziQ since the new update. Mine will freeze on me and also will stop playing when using other apps something it never did before.

Come on guys, you should have done this before the iPhone X is launched.
Update: I canceled my Pandora subscription. I have SoundCloud now. And it actually works!! It functions properly, and isn’t buggy like Pandora. Happy now. Bye.   No longer plays when on lock-screen, and stops playing if I use another app, which also means I have to waste battery keeping my screen open. Does not link to Bluetooth or hardline in car anymore, without app freezing several times. Pause button does NOT work, music continues to play unless you exit app. Piece of crap. 
I prefer pandora vs Spotify because you have a wider option of music and style of it too..
Amazing
I’ve used this service for free and deal with he ads. No problem. But the crashes completely take over my device and reboots the entire thing. I’ve been wanting to upgrade my services but with these crashes, why would I have. Have been a member since 2011. Very disappointed. However I love my stations and the service when not crashing.
Gets stuck on start up screen. Can’t change the song when my phone is locked.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble.

The past 5+ updates have all said "reduce crashes". Yeah right, nothing's changed. I still have crashes on a regular bases. I use pandora while I workout and of course, every time it crashes, I'm in the middle of the set. Worst thing in the world: you're in your mojo then boom, it's brought to a halt. Fix these dumb crashes for good!
Regularly causes crashes on my phone.
Please update to work with iPhone X
Crashes after 10 minutes literally every time i open the app.
I pay for the upgraded service but the app breaks 30 seconds in and the steam freezes since this last update
I can un-like a song but not dislike it. Put it back to neutral. The next day, it’s back to being liked. This has been going on for over a week. I’m pretty sure a gremlin lives in the Pandora app now. It needs to be killed so that my song changes stay.
Love it
I’ve used the app for many years now, and lately the pause/play buttons don’t work. If I want to stop the song I have to force quit the app. Not an ideal user experience.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for the trouble you are experiencing - this is something we are actively looking into.

To many commercials and some music anticipation is way off station cue.    Otherwise ok 
Not sure whats going on with the liscensing but more and more of the music i put on my playlists is no longer available to replay or search. Why am i paying for premium if half the music i want to listen to i cant. I have to wait till it comes on the Radio and then i cant even replay it.
I love pandora!
Love the music selection and radio algorithm. However, I have random crashes with the app. Not to mention they aren’t Directly compatible with my Hitachi Qualcomm AllPlay speakers. Spotify has so many additional features and integrates with a wider range of WiFi speakers.
I’ve always loved pandora, but I have no idea what they’ve done with the last few updates. I can’t even barely use it anymore. If I put the app in the background it pauses if I press play again it freezes up and I have to completely exit the app out and restart it. If I try to connect it to my car Bluetooth same thing it freezes and then I have to restart the whole app. Why are we paying for something that isn’t even working properly? If it’s not fixed I’m going to have to start looking for another online streaming service as this is something I use daily.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for the trouble you are experiencing - this is something we are actively looking into.

Love how I can customize a station to play my favorite songs!!
Sorry, canceling my subscription after all these years...
I purchased Pandora premium, I’ve had it for a couple months. Thought it was really cool at first.... downloaded so many songs to what it said, was on my phone... I could always play the downloaded songs when I had internet connection or WiFi, but when traveling on a plane with no connection everything was lost. It wouldn’t even let me access anything I saved in the past or anything I downloaded. I decided to delete my subscription because there really is no point.
It’s all good  but the new update is very weird . Because the first one let you close you phone and the song would be still  playing but now it dose not
...updating was a mistake
Too many ads pre skipped song. & y’all need to update to the IPHONEX screen already 🙄🙄🙄
So, lately I’ve been forced to not use my Pandora. I loved using the app while I was at work and doing chores. Even have it on my TV. But since the latest update, the app no longer works when the screen is turned off. I had also payed for Pandora One before Unser the belief that we were supposed to be able to skip a lot more songs if we didn’t like the song. Turned out not true.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble.

Love the app when it’s working but that is few a far between these days. I’ll be switching to Spotify.
There is good music on here but when I clicked on the app, at least 5-6 ads in a row played. Really stupid.
I started using Pandora when it first came out. I still have playlists that I had created in 08-09 that are awesome to go back and listen to, like going back in time. I usually listen to Pandora from a web browser on my computer at work or from my laptop at home. Ever since I have been using my iphone app for Pandora and play music via a Bluetooth connection, a BT speaker or in my car equipped with BT, I get COMMERCIALS every one to two songs. I hardly ever listen to it from a web browser anymore and don’t really plan on it as times are changing. I figured since I’m using my data plan on my cell phone to access Pandora that the least they could do was not use it all up with commercials. It’s so annoying that I have stopped using it unless I’m connected to WiFi and it isn’t costing me anything to struggle through the ridiculous amount of commercials that play. My daughters both have accounts exactly like mine, free, and neither of theirs play nearly as many commercials as mine. I created a new account, and guess what? Very few commercials!! The only bad thing is that all my playlists are on my commercial account and they are from 2009 and up. I’m stuck. I can’t afford another monthly payment, I have thought about it, but that’s not the point.... point is that it wasn’t always like this. It was great until a year or two ago. I have been a user for almost 10 years and love the experience. I wish more effort went in to keeping customers rather than attracting more and forgetting that us old timers are the reason you have succeeded here.   ~~mixed feelings 
Since the new update I can't open pandora it crashes my phone
I love it. Listen to it everyday!
Love it!
It's a good app
It plays an ad every other song
All my favorite songs from the 90s and the now! Love it!!!
Pandora always gets me through my day. I can’t imagine having to get through work without it!!!!!
The app won’t load, despite closing and reopening several times. I used to use Pandora, then switched to Spotify. But Pandora has some stations I really like and seemed to “get” my music tastes better than Spotify. I guess it’s back to Spotify- at least I can listen to music.
Great music but takes eons to delete a station (which is all too easy to create accidentally) and there isNO option for “I’m tired of this track” which we all know how repetitive Pandora gets. There should be an option to NOT PLAY ANY songs you have thumbs up , for Christ sake im trying to find new music 
Ridiculous ads every other song, and all the music is old. Download Soundcloud if you’re looking for some new music and way less ads.
👍
Pandora gets it right!  They always  play what I enjoy.  Thank you Pandora.
This app version is broken. The app crashes constantly while changing songs, and then requires you to login again when you relaunch it. Entirely unusable.  Next track button is broken as well, making control from the car while driving impossible
Really excellent except for the fact that they constantly want you to say yes or no to the music pr they turn it off. What a pain!
Great music station option. Any genre of music or artist you want.
I don’t care what anybody says; Pandora is perfect for me and completely effortless. I listen to music while I work so the commercial free version is a must have! Keep it up, Pandora! 👏🏽
Love the jazz station
Sick of hearing the same songs/tracks every hour!! If I'm paying monthly, why does the same song appears every hour!!! One more month of this and I'm unsubscribing and deleting the app off my phone/tablet as well as my account!!
So it’s kinda working.   But now you have to swipe out of phone to make it end.   Doesn’t seem to be completely connected with all the features of the app.   Please keep trying to make it better- like before the week ago update.
In addition to having to deal with inane station limits that really limit the Pandora experience, now we have to deal with a crappy app that has major control issues. Over the last couple of weeks, this garbage has started:  Ceasing playback when switching out of the app.  Randomly pausing playback.  Randomly starting playback.  Additionally, this piece of garbage has degraded to the point where sometimes it will launch on it’s own while another media player like google play is active.  While it’s not a new issue, another major source of annoyance with this little piece of millennial mental midgetry is it’s constant nagging for me to upgrade to a premium subscriptions plan. Here’s a hint: I’ve already committed to a subscription with you; your constant nagging is not going to improve our relationship.  It’s been real; I’m not wasting my money on this garbage any more. 
Well after reading all these other people so dissatisfied with Pandora I will have to go the same way. I have an old version of Pandora and wanted to update it because I was hoping it would fix some of the issues with my Apple Watch. I been using pandora for years but I also have other paid music services on my phone. So for me if Pandora does not get their act together I have other options. So for now I’m still not updating this app until I see some positive reviews.
Loved this app, I have been paying for it for 2 years. Latest update removed the ability to listen and lock the screen, or do anything else. Once they fix it I’ll give it 5 stars again.  Thanks for fixing the app. Happy to continue to pay for this. 
Every time there is an update it screws it up for normally a few days. The last one has had it messed up for several weeks now. They just did another and it still is bad. You can get about 20 seconds of music then several minutes of nothing. Then 10-20 seconds more of music then nothing. And you guys want me to upgrade and pay for this. It worked great and now nothing. Hero to Zero.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Had Sirius for ten years. Spent too much time flipping through the channels. Pandora is fantastic!!!😄 Or it was anyway. I listen to Pandora at least 4-6 hours a day at work or at home. Since the last week of November, I cannot keep it playing for more than 30 seconds at a time. It shuts off automatically. Then, it freezes. Ironically an update was done on November 29 to correct “freezing and bug fixes “. I’m waiting a week, if not corrected, buh bye Pandora!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I love the pandora app, I use it almost every day. But with this newest update, I can no longer use it. It doesn't play when my screen is locked, or when I use a different app.  **update has been fixed and app functions correctly now** 
Pandora gets one blown out chocolate star fish. It goes hard for the trash lord of apps
Awesome
My pandora shuts down at least once every time I open up the app. It’ll turn my entire phone off temporarily, which is awful for when I’m using a GPS.
Can’t listen to it for more than 30 minutes (or less) without crashing. Every time. If it doesn’t get fixed soon I’ll stop using it. There’s plenty of other music options out there.
Right now its functionally useless.  Music fades out halfway through the first song and it just locks up from there.  If I close and restart, it starts playing again, but repeats the problem about halfway through the first song.  I hope Pandora doesn\'t think they\'re charging me for Pandora One this month...  Updated 12/6/17... So now the app works again, kinda.  Music is playing again, but now the controls don\'t work, can\'t pause, etc.  Only way to get music to stop playing is to force the app to close.  My advice is to go back at least two updates and start over from there Pandora. It was working fine before you messed with it.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for the trouble you are experiencing - this is something we are actively looking into.

No complaints. No bugs. Just great music with the occasional add here and there but not so much that it’s frustrating.
Every 3 or 4 songs the app crashes and causes my iPhone to restart. Total crap!!!
I’ve had Pandora for over 7 years and a paid subscription for most of those. I’ve loved it. However, the most recent update is infuriating with the amount of problems I’m encountering. It won’t cast correctly, won’t skip correctly, won’t pause correctly and requires a shutdown every time. If they don’t take care of this VERY quickly, I’m planning to just drop this service and try a comparable music app.  Don’t you guys test this stuff before you release?? 
Just don’t waste your money on this trash. Gonbuy a pizza instead. Btw I deleted my account. I got so fed up with this bs. Thank you.
Great music choices

I like to use Pandora as alternative to radio in my car, however the interface is rarely correct on CarPlay and Pandora’s app constantly causes my phone to seemingly hard reset or makes CarPlay not connect.  Garbage app. 
In the past few weeks the app has been very inconsistent. Often it\'s unavailable or buffering so stations are unavailable. I pay $4.99 a month for the ad free version. Connecting to Bluetooth in my car is extremely frustrating and if I am listening to Pandora and try to check email, send a text or do anything on my phone at the same time Pandora freezes. I thought this was an iOS 11+ problem but now I’m not so sure. Very frustrating. If problems persist will cancel.
I deleted the app and reinstalled and all issues were resolved. I’m back to loving pandora!!      I’ve been using pandora for many years, always happy.  The last update causes a lot of issues.  Bluetooth controls don’t work, when you back out of app, not closing the app just going back to screen lock or home screen music stops, must force close the app and reopen to get it to play again, the control screen that does eventually show up in the auto lock screen is unresponsive, keeps playing after hitting pause, etc.  please fix this pandor!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I like the app but lately after a few songs it will randomly crash and it’s very frustrating. There are also so many ads that it almost isn’t worth using because it’s mostly 90% ads and 10% actual music.
It’s got any type of music u like
Awesome
Pandora offers freshness to wake up to... always available in my day and has soothing sounds for nights!  Delightful music! 
Ok so when i swipe up on my phone there is that spot for whatever music app or whatever audio related that im using. I used to be able to close the app completely and still play music from it when i swiped up and hit the play button. Now i cant and don’t know why. I liked this feature so when i closed other apps i was using i dont accidentally close the music app and stop my music and then open the app again and then again and again. So yeah
....Even after the most recent update that was supposed to fix that.
pandora keeps crashing and restarting songs over. and it will play the same add 2-3 times in a row

I love the selection with each channel but when I first turn it on it doesn’t play right away. It takes a minute to load. It can’t be reception because I travel the same ways everyday and once it starts playing it is fine. It’s ONLY when I first turn it on. It’s very frustrating when it takes 5 minutes before it plays.
The app is unusable! Since the update, I can no longer listen to my music for more than a few seconds. Prior to the update, I could play my music while my phone was locked. Now it fades and I can’t listen to songs. The app also freezes often. The new update is terrible! If it’s not fixed soon. I will cancel my subscription. I’ve been a loyal customer since 2011.
I listen quite often to numerous stations and would greatly appreciate changing songs within stations periodically. Like your app! 
I love this app
The music is great and all, but the problem is it keeps playing songs that I don’t want to hear. I thumb down certain artists because I want a station for only one or two artists. However, songs from artists that I had thumbed down other songs by them keep popping up.
Pandora has been a consistent member of my getting ready for work day routine. Thank you Pandora!
Wish I didn’t run out of skips so fast. But I still enjoy pandora.
I just started Pandora about three months ago. As it as it is now that I’m paying the app does not work at all. When I opened it, the music doesn’t play. Not only that but it froze it so whatever song I’m listening to I tried to replay it for it to work and that does not always work. And when I finally get a song to play, and I close the window use another app on my phone. It is broken all over again.This is the only music and now I am sick, I’ve been using Pandora for years.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I’ll admit, Apple changing their software so often really throws a monkey wrench in the gears. Wish they could get their platform straight! In light of all that, Pandora app is crashing often. Sometimes during ads, sometimes just during regular music. Please investigate. Thank you Apple, smh.

Pandora is my first music choice. But recently when I\'m listening to Pandora, sometimes the app may restart my iphone. I don\'t know why but please fix this!!!
Even though I update the app immediately after a new version release, the app is still constantly crashing on me after playing about 4-7 songs. Pandora has been a long time favorite of mine for exploring different music, but all these crashes have been driving me insane! I’ve tried Spotify and amazon music, but the range is interface is nothing compared to pandora. I just wish it would stop crashing on me...  I have the iPhone 8 Plus. 
Pandora does not WORK MOST the time, EVEN WITH CHANNELS SUPPOSEDLY DOWNLOADED, let alone connect to my new Honda HRV which has a Pandora app built-in!! This makes no sense at all.

Everything works well now, I’m glad it is working properly again.
Whatever happened in the last update made my Pandora unusable. When I start Pandora, it’s starts playing the music, unfortunately I can’t pause or stop the playing of the music no matter how many times I tap on the pause button. There are 2 ways to stop the music playing. One way is to kill the program. The other way is to let the phones screen go off (phone goes to sleep). So if I did want to listen to the music, I have to keep tapping the screen to keep it awake. And I pay for this service!
It used to work perfectly fine on my iPhone 7plus. Now that I’ve upgraded, it’s useless. I cannot pause or skip to the next song from my lock screen, or when I open app. I literally have to close app in order to get the music to stop playing. To top it off, I’m paying for it. Either support iPhone X n fix all the bugs, or I’m switching to another music app.   Thanks, Javier  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Love it. Love the music offered, option and available variety of music. Thanks to Pandora.  Great quality of tone compared to Amazon Music. Wide variety of selections. Thanks Pandora. Just Love it  It’s a lot of fun. Music that makes you cry. 
I appreciate Pandora because it allow me to control the flow of songs I like and dislike with the thumb system.  And because I am a premium customer I enjoy being able to replay songs I would like to hear again at my leisure.  I love the variety of categories too.  This is the only way that I listen to music.
Pandora use to work just fine, then out of nowhere it starts shutting down. It will shut off my navigation sometimes. This app seriously needs some work

So like it says in the title, I have had this app for many years and I do not pay for the services.

Update it for the X.
I’ve been using pandora since 2008 and have seen it go through a lot of good and bad updates, but recently it’s been lagging and buffering, and it’s completely unacceptable that after a month of the iPhone X being available, an app that I pay $5 a month for still is not updated to fit the iPhone X screen.
I’ve been charge for nothing, I can even download my favorite music and now it’s a nightmare to cancel this stupid subscription on iTunes
What's the point of having a "radio" of your fave artists when they only play artists that sound similar? And if I do like a song I'd watch an ad to play it again. But a lot of the time it keeps saying I have to watch an ad to replay. Sometimes I have to keep skipping songs cause they won't play so I'm hoping the next one does.
Essential for every road trip. Wether u will be on the road for days, hours, or min pandora makes every trip better! It plays all your favorite tunes, from one genre to the next! Sad songs or happy ones, Songs that help u relax or make u want to get up dance, rock to hip hop to country and then to pop and so many of your favorite songs u love to sing. Pandora has it all!! Thank u pandora!
If it had iPhone X support then I would be glad to add two more stars to this review but it does not have iPhone X support so two stars are not sent to the people who make Pandora Music.
I’ve been using Pandora for as long as I can remember and have been very faithful to it. But with recent updates, I no longer have access to it. I’m actually contemplating giving my money to spotify because I can at least exit the app and listen to music, as well as create my own playlist and listen to the music I want to listen to without having to really worry about it.  With the recent updates, I can no longer pause songs, like/dislike them, skip them, nor can I even exit the app to do other things whilst listening to said music. It’s pretty annoying when I’m either driving or needing to have my full attention on something besides my phone. The old pandora was just fine, but now you also want to charge more for something that can barely function? I’m sorry, but that’s pretty much a ripoff.   I hope something changes soon, or the new updates fix these problems that are affect basic app functionality. This is sincerely ridiculous. I just want to listen to the radios I have done so much to pretty much make perfect and now I cannot even listen to them when I would like to.. 
Why can’t I cancel my premium subscription. It shouldn’t be a problem to do so. I have went to every item the app and website offers. Sent multiple emails to support and nothing.

I was living Pandora’s ad free paid version for the past several years. Suddenly, since this last update, it will stop playing in the middle of a song for no reason. I can’t get it to play again unless I completely close the program and reopen. Then it gives me a few seconds of music again before freezing up. Totally frustrating.  Time to cancel my subscription 
I can't pause while a song is playing. I can dislike like, like and skip the song but I can't pause it. I can't do it from the app or from the lock screen. Also when a song stops playing by accident I can't continue playing it. The latest version of the app did not fix the problem. Please fix this, thank you.
While I’m glad Pandora fixed some of the bugs, I still can’t pause.  It’s like the pause button is for decoration, because it doesn’t work.   The pause button doesn’t work in the app or the lock screen.    Question:  Doesn’t Pandora do rigorous beta testing before a version release?   Why isn’t there a section on that app that users can report bugs?

Quite often when I hit the play button it doesn’t play my music, quite often when I try to stop the music by pressing the stop button it doesn’t stop the music and the only way that I can stop the music is my closing out the app.  If this was a free app maybe I could understand but I am paying for a subscription for something I am not receiving.  If this does not get fixed this will be the last Pandora subscription I pay for.
Pandora is literally the soundtrack to my life. No matter what’s going on the right song comes on at the right time. I have my pandora playing legit ALL day. My day wouldn’t be the same without it. The premium is my JAM! Definitely worth the money.
I think pandora is amazing I love to listen to Christmas music all year round
Crashes every time I listen to it. Phones up to date and app is all up to date and the problem continues. It’s not just my phone either my boyfriends does the same thing please fix it  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I really like pandora but I also listen to a lot of hip-hop and with hip-hop there’s a lot of explicit songs and for some reason every single song on pandora is the clean version which is annoying when I’m listening to a song and a piece of it is taken out  I tried changing the settings to allow the explicit music but it does nothing, but other than that the app is A1 
For the past week or two my paid Pandora does not play. After opening the app approximately 15-20 seconds in it stops playing abs does not come back on. After closing the app numerous time it still does not operate. I hope there will be a fix quickly but I also hope I'll be getting a credit for this month as well....
Freezes constantly, even on my new iPhone. Isn’t optimized for the iPhone X despite being in the top 20 apps.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Pandora is definitely the greatest music listening experience there is! :-) Pandora forever!!  😎I think your latest upgrades are great ! For me you are still the BEST !!! KEEP - ON - KEEPIN UP !!! 👍 Could simply NOT love without it !!!  🎼 You brighten every day !  🌟Still on TOP of music listening!  🎼 
Love this app!!! M83 station is perfect after a long day of work. It’s like the app knows exactly what my ears want to hear.
So I am really disappointed that I can no longer listen to Pandora. This app no longer works with my car which has Apple car play. And no longer works with my dock at home. I have since stopped paying for this service and switched to Apple Music. I honestly liked Pandora better but it is unusable for me.
Every time is use the app it crashes. Never use to do that.
Pandora is awesome every song you like or love I just press the thumbs up and like I hear it a lot if I press the thumbs up. I listen to today’s hits so it actually plays today’s hits. I hope you love pandora too!!!👍🏻👍🏻
Last two updates have completely broken the app on my iPhone X.  First of all, still not upgraded for iPhone X screen. App opens, plays music, but the play/pause button is only there for show, not able to pause a song not even from control center. On my car, music can be heard on the speakers but there is no data at all on my screen, and controls are not working either, you can not play/pause or skip a song from the car screen.  Background music playing is not working at all in the recent version, as soon as you leave the app, music stops, if you lock your phone, music stops!  Apple watch app does not load, just hangs on a loop trying to load most of the times, few times that actually loads, works as intended.  iPhone X on iOS 11.2 Apple Watch on watchOS 4.2 Pandora App on 1711.2.1 
I don’t know what you all did. But I cannot get this app to work properly, music doesn’t play when I want it to play nor does it allow me to choose the song when I PAY FOR IT!!!! It plays WHENEVER IT WANTS TO!!!! I don’t have the app up and it just plays when I DONT want it to. I want to cancel but it’s so difficult. I am very unhappy with this service. And want my money back for the last two months it’s been malfunctioning.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Here lately my music has just all the sudden stoped. I don’t know if because of the new update or what but it just all the sudden stops when I’m not even touching it. I have all the updates including the update for your actual phone up to date. I have always loved this app but here lately I just don’t want to use it because I’m constantly having to go back to my phone to make it play again.
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
Best thing I ever did...😎
Last update completely killed the app. Bugs out so I have to force close it but and reopen only to see that it didn’t actually close, repeat a few time to make it work. Also I can’t pause. The pause button will turn white like it’s working but nothing happens. It’s like the action isn’t mapped to anything.
Never a day without my Pandora!!!!
Because I can take my favorite and new found favorites with me anywhere anytime ✌🏼
Not one time that I’ve used this app has it worked flawlessly! Absolutely ridiculous shuts off at random, causes my phone’s volume to shut off, won’t play all the stations I create. Just once I’d like it to work!
!!!!
Ok so I was like yes free music I was so happy. I hit the made an account. Then O wanted to listen the song mans not hit by Big shaq The I searched it up clicked on it then. It just started playing a random song. Like no! No no no! I clicked on the song mans not hot by big shaq and it just plays some random song. I was like okay how about another song I try Juju on that beat and same thing!!! So it goes like this I search up a song click on the “track” for it then it plays another song I try to tap on the song but nothing happens. Honestly this is what you would expect from something free like this I had this app installed and uninstalled in just 1 hour. I see some much potential in this if you just let us pick our own song. I would be so happy busy until someone makes a decent free music a service that is not as rigged, I will just stick to YouTube. And hey, if I don’t believe I try it. If like this app well then good for you but I don’t think I will be using this or at least not anytime soon unless it has some big updates. If you made it this far and you read all of this thanks. Ok bye.
I’m really liking the improvements with a lot of the things pandora is doing.
This update is BAD. The app exits and stops playing when I want to do something else. It’s just bad
Running on 6s. Since update no more running in the background. That means when auto lock goes on or you minimize pandora it stops. Then freezes. Only way to play is to quit and restart. Disappointing. Guess it\'s Spotify until this is fixed.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

This is a great app to listen to your favorite music and playlist.
I am extremely annoyed from this app. It’s continuously force closing after a certain amount of songs being played. It has gotten to the point where my phone shuts off and comes back on in 10 seconds. I don’t understand why this is happening but something needs to be done. I love this app, but with bugs and minor hiccups like this it’s starting to turn into a major headache.
Pandora...come on. I used to be able to listen to u in my car with the iPhone 7. I have 2017 Honda HRV. Either apple or Pandora is to blame, but with the iPhone X in no longer able to play thru my car Pandora app, or with usb connection in my car.

On an iPhone 8 - Within the last few weeks when I open the app it launches ok, but when I try to exit the app to the main screen to perform another task or launch another app, the music stops the second I leave the app screen. It also stops playing when my phones screen dims to black while not in use for more than 30 seconds. I’ve had this paid pandora account for over 6 years and have not had issues like this before. Please tell me there’s an update coming out soon to fix this. It’s not reasonable to ask your customers to adjust their phone habits and settings so they can only be on your app to hear music and adjust settings so the phone never goes into power saving mode... 
I don’t like the fact that every time I use pandora is always playing old music. I would like for the application to add the music of today, specially if people are paying for it. It gets tiring listening to the same songs over and over again
Apparently Pandora still doesn’t have their act figured out yet after months now of the app crashing closed every time I’m a song in or 2 of listening..... so irritating  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Lots of glitches after last couple of updates.  Frozen upon opening.  Have to skip to next song to get it to play.  Sometimes have to force close app and reopen.  Happens every time the app is opened.  Shows album but won’t start playing until you skip song.
I’ve been using Pandora for years and I couldn’t imaging life without it😁
It has been over a month now and still no support. .. seems like you guys are slacking on development... I still love your app but the ads have gotten out of hand and the app doesn't pick up where it left of like it used too .... It just freezes and I have to close and re open the app ... Please fix it and make it what it used to be.... People and companies are making fun of you because you are killing your own product ..
This used to be my favorite app. Pay monthly to have ad free access but I’ve noticed since you have the newer more expensive option. The app no longer works. It’s a miracle if I hear 2 full songs or any music at all!  I will not upgrade but look for a better option elsewhere!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

This app has been great for a long time, and I even pay for it, but recently y’all have done something where it won’t work at all. It needs to be figured out quick or you’re going to lose me for good
I’ve been using Pandora for a long time, but in the last month or two, it’s become frustrating to the point of forcing me to find another app. I connect either via bluetooth or they Pandora app that is integrated into my 2017 vehicle. Used to connect easily, now it requires me to close out constantly to get it running properly. Then when I do (after 10 minutes of torture), I get the same 5-7 songs every time....until it of course disconnects or freezes. At which point I turn off the app and listen to standard radio. Terrible!
Pandora is almost as good as sex!
I love it it gives you all the music that you want you create your own stations
Pandora used to be my go to for music. Anymore all it does it crash my phone, freeze, and increase ads. Will be switching
After the most recent update you have to have to app up and open to listen!!! Your phone can’t be off and you have to stay in the app no more browsing Facebook and listening to music!!! It went from crashing constantly to being useless and draining my battery if I do listen! I love pandora and have plus but I’m canceling it because i can’t use it!
Every time I use the app it will play between 3 and 5 songs and then crash. It’s extremely frustrating!!
SuziQ86: your review was exactly my thoughts. I agree.  I never ever leave bad reviews and hate being negative but pandora, these are facts. you’ve disappointed me and it’s too frustrating to deal with. I’m Cancelling my subscription until you all get it together.
Here recently after they started the new premium membership that has been completely but he doesn’t work for either levels of membership I have downloaded this app several times reinstalled on installed so much so that I have stopped using it and switch to Apple Music
Pandora has always been a go to app for music streaming. I’ve always loved the variety and the ability to change the songs and stations however, lately pandora has constantly shut down and stops playing. It happens so often id rather not even use the app. If this problem persists I may have to start streaming somewhere else.
It's working for me but please watch out for I radio. can’t use controls on the phone to shut down the music. Never happened before.  you claim fix and it doesn’t act that way.

Every time I open the app to play my music crashes my whole phone and reloads within 10 minutes this started happening ever since the iPhone 8 an  X came out. Please can you fix this issue has been happening for a while for the past couple of months
I can usually count on Pandora for regular stable stations, but now when I lost my phone, the app crashes.
Great way to listen to nonstop music. I love it!!
Update: Uninstalling and reinstalling the app seems to work.  Same as previous reviewer. App freezes and I have to go back to main screen to do anything. If I lock my phone or hit my Home button, the music stops playing. 
Why is my Premium not mobile friendly on my iPad. It should be. Other than that i love Pandora Premium
Won’t play until I restart the app. When it does play, I can’t pause without force-closing it. If I turn off my screen it stops, but if the screen times out it never stops, even when I tell it to. This is really basic stuff, guys. Play and stop playing. It doesn’t work without those two functions. Get your **** together.
I hope you guys have someone monitoring your reviews... I’ve got the same problem as the last guy!! Plays about 30 seconds then shuts down. I’m a paying Pandora customer, I reckon you’ve got about 2 days max before we all switch to Spotify.  Oh and please put a time stamp on your online help suggestions. The last thing anyone want to do is be given general BS info (just restart and uninstall). As a customer, I expect you have 1) bothered to read public reviews and noted the problem; 2) give me some specific information about the problem, how to solve it and; 3) if you don’t know, then tell me. GET ON TOP OF IT!!!
I do really love everything about pandora because always transported us with our favorites artists
Ever since the new update the app stops playing whatever I either exit the app or turn the screen on my phone off. And when I go back into the app it won’t let me hit pause or play and I have to restart it.
It’s a nice source of up to date music. It plays a lot of music I absolutely love but can’t find as easily. The problem I have now, is it keeps pausing the music during streaming. When I plug it in to listen to it while I am driving, it will stop playing music and put on my iphones music. So I’m constantly fighting with the app to keep it open and play music. I’m thinking of i❤️radio as a new source of music.
There is no way you have 5 stars Pandora. You got some shady company boosting your rating. The app freezes and hiccups and crashes every time I use it. I downgraded from being a paid customer for years because of the botch job you did with premium. Now I can’t even use the free model.  Well guess I’ll just have to move to Spotify. I hear it’s getting great reviews.   If anyone else is frustrated by the “reviews” Pandora is receiving you can show some influence by long pressing/force touching the reviews you read and you can like/dislike. Small impact alone but together maybe something. 
I can go back in time when things were easy and I was free
Please fix these issues! Never connects properly and only plays if the phone is “awake.” Crashes constantly. Paying customer and haven’t been able to use for over a week now.
Your APP is crap Pandora. Fix it!!!!!
I was having the restart problem with my iphone6 and when I upgraded to my iphone7 the problem continued. After spending all day on the phone with apple support I later figured out it was my Pandora app causing the problem. I loved the app however I have had to delet it so that my phone will work.
Great for just about everything. I wish it would allow more skips without paying though..
The amount of commercials is unbearable!
Love my Pandora radio.  When I make and “tune” a station. (Thumb up / Thumb down)  It actually does listen!!!    Thanks Pandora! 
For the past month or so it keeps crashing after about 2 or 3 songs and restarts my phone all on its own! It’s so frustrating especially when I’m driving or doing something when I’m not hands free! It’s so annoying!
Always good music and good quality !!!
Latest updates are spotty at best. Using Pandora with iPhone X has been disappointing. Also using it with Sonos has been frustrating. Playback and streaming is inconsistent and often the app just freezes. Hoping Pandora will work out the kinks!

Tooo much ads !!! What happen to the old pandora yo!!
I’ve loved the pandora app for years & it’s been fantastic. I still have my paid regular subscription (that I’ve had for over a year) until it runs out in Dec. I was having a lot of problems until I deleted it. My daughter asked me to use it to clean her room, so I re-downloaded it. Now it’s working great without all the hiccups. I’m still not going to renew my subscription since I feel that this premium service is ridiculous (after all I can listen to any song I want over and over for FREE on YouTube.) and I’m not convinced they got the bugs out. Plus what a pain to have to constantly delete your app and re-download it every time they “fix” it. I did increase my stars from one to 3.   My previous review: Pandora used to be great. It’s been consistently closing on me before the update after 15 mins. Now doesn’t finish a song. I’ve been a subscriber for a while now I’m canceling. There’s too many other music apps that keep up with iOS development.

Ever since you updated this app it will only play about 2 minutes then just stops. I pay for this so I am not a happy person right now. I’ve had to switch to iHeart for my workday music.
Excelente
I’m so frustrated with this app since iOS 11 came out. The app will not play music when initially opened, I have to swipe the app closed. When I open it a 2nd time, it’s a 50/50 chance that it may or may not play. I have to swipe the app closed AGAIN and usually the 3rd time is the charm. BUT, once it plays, it only plays for for around 30 seconds to 5 minutes before it shuts down and causes my phone to either reboot or freeze up. After all that, then it will usually play for a while. So after all that, I usually end up playing my downloaded music. Pandora is now just a waste of time.  Previous review: Pandora works great for me. I\'ve personalized my stations and it plays songs I love most of the time. App is easy to use and I never have some of the problems I\'ve seen some others talk about if the app shutting down... I recommend it to anyone that loves music.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Great minus the adds
fantastic
Pandora has been functioning decently, until the most recent update. The app is a total disaster. It freezes when I open the app, but it doesn’t stop there. To actually play the song, you have to skip, wasting your skip because of that. The app crashes horribly, restarting my iPhone. Which means if you are driving and have maps and pandora open, maps will shut down as well, leading to no navigation. I am uninstalling and switching to Spotify!
I like using this app and enjoy its ease of usage!
I use pandora every day and pay for the upgraded service with no ads. I downloaded the update last night and today have been unable to use the app. Songs start and then stop after 15 to 30 seconds. I have closed out of the app completely and restarted my phone and this continues to happen. If this is not rectified soon I will be canceling my subscription permanently and switching to a comparable app instead. This is the not the first time this has happened with a pandora update.
I love pandora and will give 5 stars. I have 1 issue and that is my phone restarts itself every time I use their app. Hmm
I’ve been a happy pandora user and loyal supporter of this app over apps like Spotify or Apple Music. However, like in SuzyQ86’s review the app lately has been subpar to put it nicely. Freezes upon opening the app. You have to swipe it out and restart it and hope it works. Which even that is 50/50 if you’re trying to use other apps. Perhaps this is due to the iphoneX dropping but at any rate, it needs to be fixed ASAP please!
Pandora is a great great music I love very much
I have tried several different music streaming apps and Pandora is by far the best and easiest to navigate!!
Really need to fix the issue of the music not playing unless the app stays open
The update is terrible. I hate what I'm paying for pandora and can't close out of the app without my music stopping. Looks like I'll be cancelling my account now.
Quality has gone way down, it always crashes
I have been a diehard Pandora user since the beginning and even when I start to use another streaming service, I always come back to Pandora because of its ease.
Like other users ratings, I completely agree. I have used pandora daily for a number of years and stream it to my car’s bluetooth, well I did prior to this update. It continues to fail every 30 seconds or immediately if another app is running. I am dissatisfied at this point and will cancel my subscription if a fix is not applied soon. I would not buy their service until this issue is resolved.
There’s something that interfere with the audio sometimes. I’m not sure if is my cell phone but I checked my phone and is good. Anyways other than that I’m very happy with the experience im getting with Pandora...
I pay monthly for this service. I can’t get through a complete song without the app crashing. It won’t stay connected to my Bluetooth devices. Sometimes the song plays and the controls don’t work. I can’t make it stop, skip, etc. I have done all the updates. My phone is updated. I have uninstalled and reinstalled.
I’ve been paying for an ad free radio experience and I am angry that this is why I get! The app crashes every time I use it. Just stops playing half way through a song while I’m driving. The icons on the app are non responsive 80% of the time. PANDORA I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!
I pay monthly for the service since the last update, constantly shuts down the app I wish there was a button for refund all my money not happy at all
I love the app because it’s a various of music but you guys need to put the lyrics up again I enjoy reading the songs to learn them correctly and you guys stopped that
His is n amazing app ... the only downfall is the crazy mainstream they play on every station
As some other reviews I just read state, it seems the last update caused serious harm. I have been a happy subscriber for several years; this is the first major issue and it’s bad. Getting the app to start is tough. The play and pause buttons don’t work at all. If I get a text or call, the app will not come back. I have to close and restart. Not a happy situation while driving.
The app constantly crashes.
This app keeps crashing once every 2days despite all the updates...it’s unreal.
Not sure what’s going on lately but with the new iOS it continually just crashes and sometimes freezes my phone. The last update clearly didn’t fix this problem.
Hate the ads but love the variety of music
How am I suppose to jam out in my Beamer if I can’t use Pandora without it crashing? Bluetooth takes forever to connect, when It does finally connect and plays a song for 10 seconds, my phone crashes. USB is even worse. I can’t see the Pandora Menu because it says BMW/ Pandora connect and just stays on that screen. USELESS. ILL JUST SWITCH OVER TO SPOTIFY OR LISTEN TO THE RADIO LIKE A POOR PERSON!!
Since last update the app crash my phone. I re-installed twice and still doing it the same. I have iPhone 7 and friends with 6 are having the same issue.

I always loved this service and before I was a paying customer,  I was a regular subscriber since 2007 and I did love it but there are too many problems with it now!  It is constantly buffering, it says it’s playing, the meter shows the music is on and it’s in play status but the problem is there’s nothing coming out!  There is no communication between what we hear and what the machine says that we’re supposed to hear and I’m saying everything that the previous person reviewed is exactly how I feel and if this does not fix itself soon, I’m Leaving!  I had to now delete the app as per Pandora’s help instructions and my stations and everything else has to be redone! Sometimes I put on gospel music from my coworker that I play with her once a week and once it comes on for some unknown reason I cannot get gospel off and it keeps going into my playlist although the station is the selected and I have close the app hit save and hit shuffle and I cannot get rid of it. Maybe that’s Interventional.   Previous Review:  I'm surprised to see how the music is chosen for variety. I pay for it, but the optional features are very good.i love Todays Comedy Radio station however, I seem to hear the same bits. So I hit skip a lot. Maybe you can add some variety.

I pay for the no ad version and Pandora is not playing music. The music will start and then when I put the screen to sleep - the music stops. Fix it or else lose me as a customer. I have been a loyal customer for a few years but I am not going to pay for something that I can’t use.
I have the monthly ad-free subscription. I usually listen while I drive. With the latest update it freezes up immediately upon switching to any other app (like google maps). The only way to get it back on is to swipe out of it altogether and reinitiate pandora and stay there.  I did note yesterday that if I put it on and let it “settle in” for several songs that I could then switch to Google Maps and it kept playing.
Lot of buffing and adds but still nice to listen to
I love pandora but they have pop ups to get you to join. The first one pops up and right as you got to hit no, it switches to start the paid option. It's set up so the reject button on the first ad is the accept on the second option. I emailed them about this a year ago and they still do it to trick you.
The app used to multitask beautifully.  I used to be able to open pandora and start a playlist.  I could then switch to other apps and the music would continue to play.    Now I start music and switch apps.  The music stops immediately.  When I go back to Pandora I don’t even have access to the play button to start again ... just a pause button that doesn’t work.

So frustrating!  The new update is horrid!  It doesn’t work.  It has to be the only app open.  You can’t turn off the screen.  Half the time, it only plays for part of a song and then stops.  Please fix!
I thought after a month or two the bugs would get fixed but this is ridiculous. The app turns off my phone completely whenever I use it. Songs stop abruptly. I'm not able to pause songs. I have to turn off my phone in order for the app to stop running. I've never had these problems for so long.

I had dropped down to the $5 a month service after paying a ridiculous $13 a month for a few months after the trial. When I logged in yesterday it said my subscription had expired (which it had NOT) and without stating the price it said “renew now”. Thinking I was renewing the $5 a month one i hit that button. NOPE now I have the higher tier again which it told me after I hit it. Canceling now, if I can hunt down where in this App Store my subscription is managed (it is not easy to find of course). I don’t like this kind of business practice. I would have stayed if they weren’t sneaky.
Pandora is parts of my life! I have to have it!
the amount of times i’ve been requested to rate this app in the past 2 and a half minutes has compelled me to give it such a bad rating.
I use pandora in my car and historically has been amazing. The new update though is a huge step back...not sure if it’s the app or my phone. Either way, it now takes me prolly 3 attempts to get pandora to play on my car’s audio (often having to start it on my phone before connecting...never been an issue before) and when it comes up, it doesn’t display the song being played, I.e. I can’t skip, and it shuts off when I either move away from the app or close my phone. Even outside my car the app shuts off when I lock my phone or move away from the app, which it’s never done before. Hopefully they fix these bugs ASAP as this is all I listen to in my car. Very surprising and disappointing though.
After recent updates when playing Pandora at random it will make my iPhone X and my girlfriends iPhone 7 Plus restart. It’s annoying.
very good
Awesome
We've had pandora for years and I listen to it all of the time.  The new update is terrible.  I almost never can listen to pandora in my car anymore.  As soon as I try to black out my phone it turns off completely and then because I’m driving I have to drive in silence.  My city will ticket anyone who is caught messing with their phones.  It’s so frustrating.  I pay a lot to not be able to use it when I want.  Not good at all.  It’s pretty upsetting. 
Recently, songs will stop playing after a few minutes. Cannot pause or unpause. Have to completely close and reopen app to hear music again. Very frustrating; I won’t be buying any premium services until this is fixed!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Love the app. The only thing I don’t like is that I was listening to it while I was working and accidentally push upgrade version. I couldn’t never get to quite it. Even though I deleted the Pandora app I got a new phone with different provider. I have no access to my old email. I still get billed. I have no way or access to that account. ☹️
I love pandora so much i even play it every day
Pay for it no biggie but for the bugs and crashes It’s starting to get old.
I even contacted support. No response. Will cancel subscription and uninstall if no fix soon.
I love using this app, it’s easy and offers so many different genres of music.
Love it! Thank you
Amazing!!!!
Crashes while playing , I have to literally go in to the app and launch it again at least twice while listening to it sometimes as soon as the app starts playing it will crash it’s very annoying!
I love it, an app where you can find all kind of music
I have been having problems since the most recent update as well. It won’t even play through one song without stopping and then I can’t get it going again. This is very disappointing.
Pandora is one of the few on-Grid spaces that truly ADDS to the quality of living . Congratulations to all of the people who make this possible!!
I have ALWAYS had trouble with Pandora via Bluetooth in my vehicle. Crashes all the time. Very dangerous and distracting while driving. The most recent update is absolutely unusable. The song will play for 10 seconds and then stop. Every time. Rebooting the app does not fix it. It does it every time. I’ve had issues with Bluetooth connection with Pandora since I started using it. It’s amazing that they’ve never fixed it. It’s only gotten worse. Absolutely horrible.
Needs iPhone X support.
To many adds
Fantastic
Since the last update of this app. It no longer syncs with my car. The sound comes through but It can’t be controlled with my car radio controls. If it isn’t fixed soon they’ll be refunding my subscription and I’ll be using Spotify or iTunes Radio  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

The crashing on the latest version is unbearable!! I can no longer count on Pandora for my daily exercise routine. I waste waaay too much time trying to launch the app, just for it to crash minutes later. 👎🏼
I’ve been using Pandora for years and have reached the point of using this app every single day. Easy to use and the shuffle feature constantly has me pleasantly surprised. Pandora stays my go to music app because I love stumbling across old and new music with minimal effort.
I absolutely
Dear Pandora,  I don\'t like the idea of me having to pay to have a playlist and why do I have to watch so many videos just to get a few skips and it\'s saying the radio isn\'t working why?

The best app for music
need more skips
Used to work fine, but the latest update causes it to stop anytime switch away from having the app active.   This makes it useless when also trying to get directions, for example.  Worse, switching back to the app does not resume playback.  TERRIBLE UPDATE.  Do not take this update, if you can....
The app now freezes my phone and makes it reboot EVERY time I use the app, without fail.
It stops in the middle of a song lately.
App constantly crashes on iOS devices. On WiFi, will be using the app, then my phone randomly does the little spin wheel like it’s shutting off. After a second returns to the home screen and Pandora has completely closed.  Will be uninstalling after next update if this is not resolved. 
So many perks to this app and service, where do I start?
Long time user, never had an issue, built up a good music history but as of recently (1-2months ago) the app will crash after about 2 songs and that’s when using the app alone. If using while another app is open, I can guarantee at some point both apps will crash and will have to open both up again and pray it doesn’t happen again right away. It’s frustrating, Please fix ASAP.
App is crashing if I leave the app, please fix soon and I will update my rating.   I’m using iOS 11.2 on iPhone 7.   Previous: Loved this service before the app even came out. Never had any issues 
People love “easy.” Premium made this app like the Androids of the market and became more complex than necessary. Update/simplify please or back to Apple Music!! :) $3 Cheaper anyway

I’ve had Pandora for yearrrrrs and I’ve always loved it. This new update is absolutely terrible. It will stop playing if you lock the screen or open another app. (Pretty sure this isn’t YouTube. I shouldn’t have to waste my battery having the screen on to listen to music.) And it no longer stops playing when you unplug your headphones. Not to mention I can’t skip or pause a song with my car radio controls anymore (and half the time the controls don’t work in the app either), nor does it tell me what track is playing on my display. So if I want to know I have to wait until I’m not driving and go back through all the other songs I’ve listened to in the meantime to figure it out. Seriously about to cancel my subscription if they don’t fix it soon. It’s completely useless now.
I don’t like paying for a music app that won’t work in the background. I used to be able to put the phone down and let the screen “sleep” and still listen to music. I hope for a new update very soon to fix this issue so I don’t feel the need to cancel my subscription.
The app no longer works with my car. I just dropped Sirius XM to go with pandora but maybe not. New update - new problems.
After updating today my Pandora app acts like YouTube when I’m listening to music, anytime I lock my phone or close the app the music stops. I also lost controls of skipping songs over Bluetooth controls and headphone controls. I have not been able to use the app in almost a week and I am beginning to get fed up with it. Pandora is about to lose my business and Spotify or Apple Music will be gaining it.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry to hear that - our support team would be happy to look into this for you.

I'm not sure how the last update was supposed to fix crashes, because mine didn't crash before the update and now constantly does. Worse yet, it seems to restart my phone- so I lose everything else running too, like GPS! It's one thing to not work, it's another to cause everything else to not work too. Hopefully it'll be fixed soon, because it's otherwise a great service.
Unusable - Bluetooth has a major bug, when it disconnects externally the app “crashes” but still plays music through your phone until you force-quit the app.  I’ve been a subscriber since 2007, this kind of “overlook” is inexcusable at this point.  Get your QA in order or I’m done making excuses for you.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I like this more than Spotify. I’m too lazy to find new music. So this app is best.
Love this app to the moon but the latest update never fixed the crashes and frozen screens.  Please fix this 😐 ... you’re light years better than Sirius XM radio ... don’t make this holiday horrible ☹️

Marriage turmoil.  I love the concept...marrying my car stereo or Fordpass to the internet.  but it’s controlling.  I felt conditioned to respond in order to get good programing. I have the thumb up/down as I felt the tunes. It was glitchy with FordPass.  Items: lockups, try later, not available right now, reverts to FM Radio, and provides no guidance toward a solution.  I have spent 30 minutes on hold, at Ford. On several (3-4?) occasions.  In addition I have idled my car three times for an hour.  This is my brand new performance mustang engine!!  At this time I’m not seeing restitution but I’m not getting solutions from ford’s support groups.  The passing the buck needs to be stopped. This is time consuming and hasn’t been a good resolution.  I’m out of time now.
Pandora used to be fine. Now not only is the music stale and the same with every station within the same genre. IT WILL NOT OPEN WITHOUT BEING CLOSED A RESTARTED. This needs to be fixed pandora. Basically unusable with a hands free system in the car as well. VERY DANGEROUS. Please address and fix.
This app has been crashing and restarting my phone for quite a few months now, even after several updates stating that the app will be fixed, so i will not be using this anymore. Very annoying!
Pandora is a radio, but better and you can put it on anything and bring it anywhere! I recommend Pandora to any age because you can create any station with whatever kind of music you want! I am sounding so professional.   What I mean is that Pandora is good. Yay. 
Nearly every time I open the pandora app or try to play in my vehicle over Bluetooth, it won’t stream. I have to force quit the app and restart it. My girlfriend has the exact same problem in her car.
The latest update has made it impossible to play Pandora on my iPhone. Once the screen locks or I open another app, Pandora stops playing and locks up so I have to swipe out. This is ridiculous.
The newest update is horrible!! My pause/play button doesn’t work and the app pauses the music almost every time I open any other app. or when my maps is giving me directions and never resumes the music. I have to continuously exit out of pandora and restart it to get my music back. If they don’t fix it with a new update it looks like I’m done with pandora 💔  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Huge fan of pandora but with the new update it no longer works. It plays for a short while then stops. So frustrating!
Love it!! Great holiday music and I can shuffle the channels I want!!!
Great job at keeping up with all the new music!
Great app use Pandora almost everyday love it!  Just one thing after the most resent update is that I can’t play or pause the music at all in the app even when my phone is locked.... kinda annoying 
I pay monthly for the commercial free service as well and this update that they did has made the app SO much worse.  It keeps crashing and when I try to open another app while listening it shuts off.  Fix it NOW!
Amazing!!! I have no words!! Worth it. Pls get this app!!! Free
Lately, every once in a while, a random song will play even though it’s labeled differently. For example, I listen to the Patton Oswald Channel, a stand up comedian channel. All of a sudden, a rap song will play, but will say it is a stand up comedian. Just now, a hawaiian music song played (I have no channel even close to hawaiian music) and when I looked at my screen, it still said it was a stand up comedian. It wasn’t. I pay for this every month. Fix it.
App crashes for no reason at random times During playback. Causes phone to reset even when it’s only app running. Bluetooth connectivity causes communication issues with phone.

What’s the point of paying for a subscription? Song selection is still awesome.
Pretty self explanatory but I’ll open the app start my music and if it doesn’t crash or not work altogether, it will play music. Then if I got to my home screen to do something else the music stops playing. I pay for pandora one and I used to love this app. I’m about to switch to Spotify and say screw it. iPhone X latest software
Para pasar momentos con música
This use to be my go to music app.. loved it BUT, the last couple of months it has become a PIA! It will play 2-3 songs and then crash and close.. I’ve got to constantly relaunch. I’ve even deleted it and reinstalled it. Same issues.. Very frustrating.  I use Amazon Music mostly now. If they fix the crash issues I’ll come back but until then they’ve lost a customer.. probably for good.  Latest update didn’t fix the issues... I’ll try back in about 6 months... 
I’m enjoying it
I have used the app for several years, and had no complaints, until the last update. It crashes about 1 minute into a song, and I can never get it to play again that day.  Please fix this.

It won’t let me into the app, anytime I click on it it just closes the app and I can’t use it whatsoever.
What gives?  Same as the others.  I’m paying for a service that worked until the update on 12/2/17.  Then, it doesn’t want to work.  Get it working soon or I’ll cancel my subscription!
The ads that play are so repetitive they get annoying, I think there should be a variety of ads if there is going to be ads.
Am I the only person that has had nothing but bad experiences lately? This app barely works anymore and when it does it keeps crashing. The only thing that seems to work fine are their advertisements. Very disappointing.
My wife and I have been using this app for YEARS. All of the sudden now, the app freezes, every time I switch screens the music stops playing, when I close my screen, the music stops playing.

Keeps crashing switched to Spotify happening for too long now 👋🏻
I’ve had Pandora on my phone for years and in the last few weeks I’ve been experiencing bad service. Song plays for not even a minute and stops. I swipe out and turn it back on and the same thing happens. Also, the pause button isn’t functioning. The only way to stop a song that IS playing is to swipe out. Help!
The thumbprint radio should only play the songs you’ve thumbprinted !! 🤷🏽‍♀️

Pandora is the best app for music
I used to love Pandora, but the last update killed it for me. Why does my music stop every time my screen turns off or I switch apps? Spotify doesn't do that.
Last update I constantly have to restart/ boot app on Bluetooth. Most recent update 11/30/17 app constantly quits playing and reboot don’t help. Also quit outputting track info to my stereo. Not really pleased with most recent updates and wonder why I even pay for it at times like these.  I figured it out. Put me on the payroll... Pandora will no longer play when my phone auto locks. Could you fix this please. 
Love it and can’t get enough !
I cannot cancel. They CONSTANTLY annoy you with trying to get you to upgrade to premium and make it SUPER EASY to do that. But then good luck canceling it. This is such a pathetic company.

Please correct the problem with Pandora. It’s been glitching on me for the last couple of weeks and has gotten to the point where I cannot even play the music. When will this be updated? I’d rather cancel my subscription and not pay for something I can’t use.
Pandora is great. I just notice that when I open the app it doesn’t work at first so I have to exit out about three of four time to get it to start up correctly.
Love pandora has the artists I love
This app is super good and easy to use and it makes work easier and it is a free app
^^^
I know it’s free version and commercials help you pay the bills...but really 2-3 commercials per 4 songs is too many. Since I’m hearing complaints about paid version I’ll have to use alternative. It was great while it lasted.
well every time I use it it’ll sometimes display the shutting down screen (like when your phone dies) even if my phone has plenty of battery. when you turn it on after this the phone still has the battery left but every app has been closed. don’t think all of these amazing reviews are legit and they probably delete bad ones but oh well.

I’ve been a long time user of Pandora and have enjoyed using it for free without problems. Recently, however, the app has been causing my phone to restart itself at any moment while I’m listening to music through the app. It will randomly cut off and cause my phone to restart/reboot and I will have to go on Pandora to restart my music. I have never had any issues with the app until now. Please fix!

Pandora programmers, I’m not sure what happened in the last update, but I have to restart the program at least twice just to get music to actually play. I’ve never really had issues with the service before. So, while I won’t give a bad review, you should know that you have something wrong and need to fix it.

I have an iphone 6 and ios 11 and i cannot keep the app playing music when the phone goes in to autolock. I followed the support directions to turn off my phone and when that didn’t work i uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Same thing. Every time the phone goes in to autolock the app stops playing. I change the phone auto lock and did the app sleep timer with the same results. I can get it to work on my really old ipod touch but not my phone. Oh well. Guess i will say good bye to the app and just do sirrius-xm or play my downloaded music.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

After latest update app crashes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing. Please feel free to reach out to our support team directly for assistance: http://pdora.co/AppReview 
I thought I was the only one experiencing these problems but from the looks of it I’m not. App has gone from great to hate not sure when it happen but I concur with other users. Plays a song for thirty seconds then it stop playing meaning I can’t hear or if I go to another app it stops playing only a reboot or changing the station will allow me to regain control of the music allowing to play, stop/pause music selections. Who puts out upgrades without testing? Fix the problem!
Ever since the latest update, the app wouldn’t play unless it is open on my phone. I had to reinstall the app to fix it.  So far, it works.  My only reservation now is how the app replays songs too frequently. The whole reason I pay for Pandora is to hear new music similar to stuff I like... not just hear the same twenty songs I have thumbed up.
I have used and paid for Pandora for years now and have always had a great experience until now. When I open the app it freezes so I have to close it completely, reopen it and skip the first song that plays to make it work. Now it quits playing music if I hit my home button to check anything else on my phone. I’m not about to sit around with my phone unlocked and screen on with pandora open every time I want to listen to a song. Lastly, it will not display any information or respond to any commands made via Bluetooth. Whether it be my headphones, car stereo or Apple Watch nothing works with it.   I truly hope this gets resolved soon so I can have my awesome music experience back and give back a 5 star rating. 
All apps that constantly hassle me for a review get one star.

I pay for the “plus “ service, and was happy until the last month or so when the app’s behavior changed.   Now. the app *no longer works well with my car’s Bluetooth  * stops playing music If i open any other apps  ( the way YouTube operates ). Even if you open up text messages, the app stops the music .

Good
Need to fix the bugs that keeps crashing pandora
I love being able to find exactly what I'm wanting and feeling! Love you pandora!!! Thank you for existing ❤️💋
When I first turn on the app, the music won’t play. I keep pushing the play button but it’s frozen. I have to change stations than change back to the station I want. And you guys could use more music variety, newer songs faster. But otherwise, overall it’s a pretty good app.
I like pandora the service. I still think they do the best job of creating a random playlist for you and helping you discover music. The app is really not great though and crashes more than it should. Doesn’t seem like they put much effort in to UI/UX or in to stability improvements
I don’t want to reach out to the Pandora supprt team! I want the same quality function I’ve experienced for 3 years. App now crashes often under many different circumstances. Thinking of Spotify instead :(
Why can’t we download some music like I need Isaiah Rashad in my playlist smh
Not usable on IPhone X. Really needs an update
Pandora has worked perfectly up until recently. I pay for premium service only to not be able to listen to anything. If I get out of the app for even a minute the entire thing freezes and will not let me back in. It\'s been about a week with the same issue and although I cannot listen, they wasted no time taking my money within this week. I am frustrated beyond measure by all of this and from what I\'ve read in other reviews, I\'m not the only one 😡  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble.

After las update app crashes way too often. And doesn’t respond to commands.
I used to love Pandora. I would even praise it to my friends as being better than Spotify. However, every time I open the app, I can only use Pandora Plus features instead of the Premium package I paid for. The only way I could fix it was by deleting the app and then re-downloading it. This has been happening for several months now. My girlfriend has had Spotify for months and it’s been reliable every time, so looks like Im making a switch and cancelling my $14 a month subscription.
When I start pandora up it goes fine... as long as you stay on the app. As soon as you go to try and use another app, the music stops playing immediately. It never did this in any other version.

Pandora is the best
Seriously I’ve been using the SAME Pandora account for over 7 years and haven’t had as many problems with freezing and crashing in all of those years as I have the last 6 months. I’m so frustrated by Pandora (which has always been my favorite even with commercials) that I’m now paying for AppleMusic instead of my Pandora account. 🖕  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Cool app needs to be update to fit the x screen annoying that it’s not due to the iPhone being out for weeks now
Thank you for the amazing tunes.   Only thing I would change: Please include "Never play this one song/artist again" button next to the thumbs down button  I don't like how the thumbs down button changes the entire station 
My phone crashes every single time I use Pandora. Which used to be a lot! I love pandora but with these crashes I can’t even use my phone.
I’ve been a fairly long time user of Pandora One. The poor performance of this app is almost making me consider leaving them for online radio. First and foremost, here recently the app has been real garbage. Every time I open it it’s either wanting me to sign into Facebook, or sign up for the higher Pandora service. To me that’s a bit insulting as a person that already pays for Pandora One. There aren’t supposed to be ads, and I certainly don’t want to sign into Facebook on Pandora. Here recently it’s been terrible about audio playback too. For example, the other day if I’d switch to another app or if my phone would go to sleep Pandora would quit playing music. An uninstall and reinstall of the app did fix this. Another issue I’ve been having is sometime I’ll get a notification from another app, the music volume turns down for said notification, but then it doesn’t turn the music back up after, making me close the app and reopen it. One other complaint I have is if I pause the music, the app sometimes just plain seems to forget once I hit play if I spent too long on pause. In order to get music to play again I have to go and reopen the Pandora app. Often times whatever song I was enjoying is no longer there. Really discontent with the quality here recently.
For the last several weeks, no matter how many updates are released, no matter if I uninstall and reinstall, it crashes and restarts my entire phone every few songs. Add that to the relentless commercials, including ones for feminine hygiene products while listening to kids’ stations, and we won’t be back to Pandora for a while.
I pay a monthly fee for ad free and I can’t even pause or skip the songs. It crashes all of the time and is very frustrating. I’m going to Spotify where I can download songs to my phone to use in offline mode. Thanks Pandora!!
Constantly crashes. Also when you pause the song and go out of the app to anything else, when you return to pandora it skips the song you paused  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I tried to sign up but it would not let me. Hummmm I wonder why I only kept this app for 2 minutes
I love this app, mi partner on my trips 👍🏻👍🏻
The app is suddenly behaving itself again and making it a big part of my daily life.
Used to be a huge fan of pandora, loved it regardless of being very similar to radio and repeating the same songs over the case of an hour or so..... with this last update pandora has legitimately become the biggest waste of my money.  Now I have to have the app open and on the actual app to listen to it.  If I click my home button or if I switch to another app the music just abruptly stops and it doesn’t just stop but it completely freezes the app all together.  I drive for lyft so listening to music is something I enjoy for hours while driving.  Now that the app got updated I’m literally throwing away my money.  Everyone kept telling me to switch to Spotify because it was so much better..... maybe it’s time to switch.  Guess I should thank pandora for making the switch so easy
love my pandora
I love pandora soooo much this is my #1 go to app!❤️
I LOVE Pandora, but something’s wrong with the latest update. I can’t open any other app or the music stops. If I pull Pandora back up, it’s frozen, so I have to close it and wait a few seconds then open it again. First world problems, I know, but I’ve been paying for Pandora for years and this has never been a problem. Just thought they’d fix it within a few days—I’ve been checking daily for an update. I also saw an article on Wall Street Journal that we can now use the Pandora app to control our Sonos speakers—and I read all the news releases I could find to learn how, but there was no how-to anywhere. I still see nothing in Pandora’s iPhone app that associates with other apps. Still love the service—just hoping they get it right with the next release.
Maybe now it only crashes 10 times a day.   I used to love this app and, even with minor issues, it always worked fine.  Never a major issue took so long to get fixed.  Now it crashes all the time causing the phone to restart, with consequent lost of any action in other apps (email, web browser, games, etc.)  Note: I never write a negative review without contacting first technical support. 
I paid for the app for a while. When all it did was constantly play the same ole songs over and over. Still does it without paying for it too. Issue now is that it hardly works. It says that it there is a weak signal. Yet, I can turn on Spotify and have no issues at all. Very disappointed. My preference has always been Pandora, but, now it seems Spotify is the way to go. Or at least it works, where ever I am.
With all the other music apps out there Pandora has always been solid.
I have tried most of the apps in the app store and this is one of my favorites hands down. Amazing service and functionality makes this a must have.  Great quality of sound as well. Thanks a bunch! 
Una de las mejores aplicaciones
As a loyal customer for years, I must say that my patience is running thin. I get not everything works perfectly but this is absolutely ridiculous and a waste of my time. Not only do I have to leave the app open, meaning I can’t do anything else on my phone without Pandora shutting down but even when I do leave it open the music app automatically shuts down after a couple of minutes and I have to keep reloading.   I use to be able to text, surf the Internet and even go into other social media applications.   I hope these bugs are quickly fixed. With the holiday season here I am constantly having friends and family over for gatherings and love playing pandoras Christmas station in the background. 
Always works great! Love it
I really like it plays a lot of a great songs! I like it
I like Pandora but they’re are a lot of adds that are bothersome and ruin the music but it’s a good app overall:)
After the recent update the app is unusable. On start it plays the stations while the app in foreground. When turning screen off or switching to another app, it mutes the music and provides no way to listen anything until app restart. On restart all happens over again.  I used to listen to pandora during my morning running. Pretty annoyed not able to do it with my premium subscription.

I love it so fun to listen to the music of my choice
Every time I lock the screen the music stops. Guess I pay to have music that I can no longer listen to at work, in my car, or while working out. If this is not fixed by the end of the month I will be canceling my subscription and switching to one of the many other services that will Work on my phone.
I learned how to customize my stations & perfect the selections for each.  I listen to a Heavenly Lullabies when I'm winding down;  There's my Relaxation channel that mimics the recovery music from my hospital stay-AMAZING;    Just created my Adele channel for when I'm into revving up the gears of my day & to sing along;  My grandchildren absolutely love the Princess, Disney & children-themed stations;  Some days I explore & find new genres to enjoy;  I log numerous hours every day of the week & would be lost without it-I'm hooked! 
Loyal customer for years. The latest update is an epic failure. The app only works when it is opened the first time and only if it is left open. This is entirely counter to what we use this app for.  Please recall the update and let us have our music back. 
Same as SusiQ86. Stops playing after a minute or so and won’t start again. Power cycled phone and watch, Bluetooth on or off, no dice. What gives with the update 5 days ago?
Like the other review this app crashes so much it’s unusable. I am using Spotify radio now as a result. I have the iPhone X.

Out comes an update for the phone and pandora, now you can’t control the app with any Bluetooth device. About to cancel my subscription.
I love this app so much but it needs to have a couple of bug fixes like it shouldn’t need WiFi so on trips we don't need WiFi. Lastly we should pick what songs that we want not just that station and song like it.
I too am having Problems with the app freezing and crashing when I open it. I’ve never had problems before, other than it being slow to load. I’m bummed as I have used Pandora for many many years and love to listen to Christmas music add free during the holidays. My phone has the latest version and I have the updated version of the app as well. Hopefully this gets resolved quickly!
It gives me endless music I love as well as introduces me to great music I didn't know about before!!!
Most recent update is horrible. 1st song stops playing for no reason. Have to skip 1st song in order for app to work. Cannot pause song, only way to get music to stop playing is to close app. Cannot skip song when the phone is locked or from swiping up. Volume goes low while song is playing even though phone volume is on high. Pay for premium service, nothing premium about it. Been days and no new update from pandora to fix any of these issues.
I enjoy the app. And deleting and then re-downloading the app fixed the problem with streaming on iOS.

We have the Pandora app on our Samsung smart TV and it will play partially through some songs and move on to the next.  Aggravating.
Pandora is the one and only music app!...I would never consider another.
It’s a blessing to have Pandora in my life and in my patients lives. I often use music therapy
I used the love this app. Everyone would tell me I was crazy and should use spotify and now I’m starting to think they’re right. This app does nothing but my phone crash and restart. It did the same thing on my 7 plus and now my X, no matter the time or day or even station in listening to. I was hoping the recent update was going to fix this issue. But it hasn’t. Get your crap together!!!
I use to be able to start Pandora then Waze before my drive. Ever since the update, Pandora WILL NOT WORK IN BACKGROUND. By the way, if your screen time out MUSIC WILL STOP.

Best music app
You have relief Friday and will take a little time to come over tomorrow morning and pick him up from school tomorrow night
Ever since I got the latest update, Pandora doesn’t work. Only one song plays before it freezes, and the play/stop button is frozen. Rebooting my iPhone doesn’t change anything. Pandora is now useless. PLEASE FIX!!!!!!!
I’ve been using Pandora for years, even defending it when people complain about its lack of superiority as a music service. But with the new update the app isn’t even usable. What’s the point of a music app that doesn’t play songs for longer than a few seconds? And why will it not play if you close your phone or navigate to another app when previously you could? What on earth am I paying for? I’ll be canceling my subscription if this isn’t fixed, I was already on the fence about the continued use of Pandora but this has really changed my mind and infuriated me.
Many song titles from different artists. I pay extra for uninterrupted song play without commercials ads interrupting my radio station. Very satisfied with pandora.
I am so angry that I am paying a monthly fee and the app has stopped functioning properly. It no longer plays in my car without me having to close it and open it at least 3 times. It shuts down after each song and if there is another app open. This is dangerous while driving!!! I want a refund and will be looking for another music app. Totally disgusted!!
The app plays one song then crashes. I’ve used Pandora for many years and I pay for ad free service. Recently the app crashes after one song and I have to restart. It also stops playing if I open another app. This is a new issue for me. Need some help Pandora. Very frustrating.
This latest update has broken this app!! It stops playing after about 30 seconds and will not start. If you answer your phone it will pause but never unpause. When it does play you are unable to pause it. I have used and paid for this app for years, but now seriously considering using another. I used to play it every day on my hour commute home.
In the last month or so, Pandora has been really acting up. Crashes all the time, and constantly goes offline when I’m on LTE and WIFI. Plus it still hasn’t been updated to iPhone X.
Good music times spirits and now.
This app was fabulous until a couple months ago. Now it shuts down all of a sudden. You have to reopen the app after every 5 min. I’m seriously considering never using this again if it doesn’t get fixed
Plays all varieties of music your use to listening to and even newer ones that hasn’t been played yet. Love it.
Find a version of the app that works and leave it alone! This most recent update does not allow your screen to be turned off and pandora to continue playing.

I\'ve had it crash a few times lately. Ads may be annoying, but it\'s free. You\'re getting what you pay for.

I’ve paid for my subscription for years and I don’t know what happened during the last update but I’m unable to use it. My phone now crashes when using it (I have an iPhone 7plus on most recent software, so not some old phone) I can’t use Pandora in the car anymore which is a major reason for having it. I’m considering just using Apple Music as my music program now, I’m a student so I can pay them basically the same amount every month and listen to whatever I want. I hope that you can fix pandora for everyone else's sake. A lot of your listeners might take to other programs.
Pandora is awesome!
This is a greats app  I luv the update where u can replay songs but there is some improvements to make Mrs or mr pandora keep on innovating music as it is
I’ve been using Pandora One for so many years and never have any problems with it. With this last update, the song will show that its playing and I can’t hear anything. Nothing is wrong with my phone. Most of the time now, Pandora won’t even play the song. It’ll just show the title. And, if I even get it to start working, I can’t pause the song!!! AND, I can’t change the song from the home screen. WHAT?!? I’m getting ready to cancel my subscription.
When my phone goes to sleep, the music stops. The app still thinks its playing, and none of the controls work. Brilliant update folks. The app is now basically unusable
You can make a station and slowly shape it however you want. You can even have a station of just the artists you like most and it'll pick around their genres. As you play and thumb up or down songs it'll play eventually only the songs you've thumbed up till new songs from the artists or genre come out. It only does this though once you've gone through all of Pandora's library from those artists or genres so it could take a long while or be very short depending on how new or old the bands/artists are.
I use pandora everyday, in the car, while I get ready, etc. because of the new updates, it crashes and I have to mess around with the app for minutes at a time just to get ONE song to play! I noticed some others on this review have said the same... it’s been happening since before the last upstate so I’m not sure exactly what that last one was supposed to help with... it helped nothing and that was 5 days ago. Hope its fixed soon or I will be downgrading my account and using another music source with less issues.
The most recent update has caused a lot of issues.   1 App seems to freeze once loaded. You can’t pause tracks.   2 if you browse away from the app your music stops.   3 if your phone locks music also stops.   4 ties into #1, once you’re back in pandora after either situation 2 or 3, you have to close the app and then reopen it again.   When will a new update be available?

Horrible
Need more comedy. It repeats too often even when i do a thumbs down.
Every time I open the app, it freezes. I have to close and open it twice every time. Once it’s actually open, it just stops playing if I minimize the app, connect to bluetooth, or run any other app in the background. I’m about to cancel my subscription because it’s literally unusable now. Someone please for the love of god fix this. I’ll be with Spotify until this clears up.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble.

this is an awesome app I haven't got any issue with it iPhone 6s Plus iOS 9
Extremely poor update! I used to love pandora music but the last few weeks the app crashes and restarts my phone every few minutes!!!!!! This is horrible!!!!!!!!

Real asta la muerte
Music won't play in the background. The app is only useful when in the foreground with the screen on
After the last update (12/1/17) the app stops playing music when you click out of it !!!! Just like YouTube 😢 Please fix this !!!!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble.

Previously I’ve been a huge fan of this app. The last two updates have destroyed it. 3 weeks ago, made it slow and constantly would freeze when trying to hit play and pause. The update this week made it automatically stop playing once the screen went to auto lock or you tried to open another app.   I don’t know what’s happening....but they seriously need an upgrade on the talent trying to release “bug fixes and enhancements”. So frustrating! 
I used to be able to search for a station by typing what I was looking for... not anymore.  Like R&B Christmas music, and there would be stations that played Christmas music by R&B artists... now, it just gives you one option for R&B music on Christmas Day; they're not even Christmas songs.  I have tried various ways to search it - to no avail.  So annoyed that I don't want to even use Pandora anymore.  The search options are horrible now.  And I used to use it for running... that's out the door too.  Sorry Pandora, hope you go back to the simple way of searching for music stations.  I don't have time to create playlists and that's why I used pandora.  Not now :(
I completely agree with SuziQ86!  What the heck happened to Pandora?  I’ve paid for Pandora One for a year, and now it’s more than twice as expensive, and it doesn’t work.  I might be moving on to a new service.
The best
Love pandora however:  I can no longer listen to pandora in the background after the update.  Music turns off if the phone goes into sleep mode or you home button out of pandora and open any other app. Please fix immediately. Music apps need to play in the background. Also no longer responds to the air pods.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble.

Support the iPhone X screen size already!
Pause doesn’t work and music stops
Can’t get past the first few notes of a song, even 10’ from my wifi router. I am annoyed.
i accidentally bought a subscription and it just immediately got it think you should have it to be 2 steps and so no one will accidentally buy it , and also it crash too much
When I first got this every time I try to select my first song for my station it crashes, I have a Iphone5SE. THIS DOES NOT DESERVE THE SECOND BEST MUSIC APP.
Sometimes I hit the Thumbs Down button my mistake. Either my hand accidentally hit the button while ride my on a shaky vehicle or when I meant to hit the Thumbs Up button.   When I hit the Thumbs Down button by mistake, the song automatically stops playing and goes to the next song. I try to get the song back on the playlist to no avail.  I think Pandora at least confirm if we want to give a song a Thumbs Down. Frustrating. 
The most recent update won’t allow me to press pause! Help!
I understand that having the free version means limited selection & commercials. However, the amount of commercials rivals the amount of songs in between them. It doesn’t make me want to upgrade to the paid service, but more not use this company at all.
I have pandora plus. Money out of my pocket. Up until now I’ve loved this service and recommended it to everyone, specifically for the offline listening feature included with pandora plus, however after the latest update I can’t exit out to use another app, send a text, or even turn my screen off without the app crashing and my music stopping. I’m gonna give it a week or two and if it doesn’t get fixed I’m cancelling my subscription.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble.

I pay for you tube red mainly because I can use another app while listening to music. The great thing about Pandora is that it allows that already. 0$ It’s great I like listening at work or while entertaining company. I’m bout to get rid of you tube red and pay for Pandora before month is up.. Rock on guys....!!!!!!!
This use to me my favorite music app, but the most recent update destroyed it. The app constantly freezes and buffers when I never had this problem before. The new interface is also a nightmare to use. While the last interface was mostly intuitive.   Canceling my sub and finding something else. What a shame. 
App freezes, stops playing music about 30 seconds in on each song and sometimes won’t play a song until I close and reopen the app!!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

It used to be awesome I used to be able to play the music for hours and now it’ll play 2-3 songs then have a weird glitch and stop playing and have a spinning wheel and when you go back in it’s frozen and won’t play any songs.. causing me to have to restart my whole phone.
I agree with suziQ86. I’ve enjoyed pandora for years and now I am unable to switch apps during play or even turn off the display so I can put the phone in my pocket without the music stopping. I also have to close and reopen the pandora app in order to get it working again. Very annoying. 
perfect music perfect timing my go to for all my music enjoyments so convenient and soooo good
This was a very cool app I listen to that includes any genre of music that u wish 🎶. If you like a certain artist, you can create a station with songs that are similar. If u did not like one, then u can dislike it and it won’t play ever again on your track.
I never had issues with pandora until I did the latest update which was to “fix bugs and crashes” well it never crashed until this update. PLEASE FIX THIS. I pay for this app monthly. I’m a very upset customer.
Every time I use it crashes and I have to restart. Need to get an update that will fix the issues. Obviously what has been done isn’t working.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

iOS 11 update equals crash every use. Not sure why. Also the ads are out of control. I’ve been a long time user but believe I may find another app. The ads are much much worse than they have been in the past. Sad to see it come to this.
I love pandora it just seems like the last last few months there are more commercials than before. I understand I am listening to free music and there has to be an income but it just seems like commercials are getting more and more frequent. I worry in the near future that pandora fans will be forced to buy pandora plus or end up listening more to commercials than music.
I got the new update as well and it’s crap I’ve been listening to Pandora for years and never had the issues I’m having now. The update says it fixed the bug of it crashing or not playing a song after 30 seconds. Bull it seems more like the update is causing the problem and not fixing it and it’s crap. With this recent update it sounds like they adapted this saying to the company moto “ why is there always enough time do it right the second time then there is to do it the first time.”  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Every time I open, I have to wait for a screen to load asking for my permission to post to Facebook. Maybe they are hoping I will eventually allow it out of frustration or by accident. I pay for the premium service. I just don’t want Pandora to post to my Facebook.  And I don’t want to see this pop up or any others ever again.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I am still having the same problem. When I make a station to listen to a specific artist, I hear more similar artist than I do of that artist which wasn’t the case when I started using pandora.   Previous Post:  Pandora used to be my favorite. I used to listen to a station and the majority of the songs would be of that artist and other songs they featured in. Now, I have to skip through a bunch of random artists just to hear that specific artist. And the ads are very annoying, every skip, there's an ad. Pandora is in no way worth paying for, especially since the music I hear now isn't even what I want to listen to. Pandora's performance has went down a lot. 
I would like if Pandora fill the whole page with Album Art.  I like the Album Art. There is too writing all over the app. To much reading. Please make Album Art much BIGGER.    Thanks. Love you Guys, 
i have no idea what’s happening but i can’t listen to music! i go on the app but then suddenly it stops! i go back on it and it’s frozen, so i swipe up and go on it again but it doesn’t work.. i’m so disappointed!! i have always been pleased with pandora so i have no idea what’s going on.
Listen all the time and love it!
Poop. I can’t connect to my Bluetooth in my car and actually have any control over the songs. I can’t skip or pause without closing the whole app. The music will continue to play even after I turn off my car and I can’t get the music to stop playing! It all used to work great but now I’m regretting purchasing anything! The songs skip on their own or will stop playing or repeat the last 6 songs played.

I’ve been using pandora for several years now, and it’s just these past 2 months that it’s been acting up. I connect it to my car via aux cord, and it will play a song and then freeze, then I’ll look at my phone and it will have a loading circle spinning with a black background. After that my phone resets and asks for my password. All of this is happening while my music is stopped. Then once i unlock my phone pandora restarts the same song i was already in the middle of. Also, ads come up every 2-3 songs-even though it didn’t do that in the last year or so before all of the updates. I expect a few commercials but not a bunch at once between every 2 songs! The new updates clearly ruined pandora.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

I understand that in order to listen to free and good quality music that there has to be advertisements, but six 30 second advertisements in a row anytime I open the app is a far bit ridiculous.
So glad I upgraded. Don't miss the commercials and so worth it. Just discovered the genre options. Awesome. Especially Hipster Cocktail.
Omg, I don’t know what this update was supposed to fix but it ruined my Pandora. It stops after 30 seconds of playing and if you try to lock your phone or open another app Pandora freezes. It’s like being on YouTube now. You can only stay on the Pandora app but at least with YouTube I can resume where I left off once I go back in the app. You can not even do that with Pandora now. Please fix it! I love Pandora and would hate to have to be exclusive to YouTube now.
I’ve been using pandora for years! And lately I’ve updated it and from the start of the app it glitches and my phones goes back to the main screen. Booting me out. Even after the updates still freezing :(
Great service but needs to be tweaked and  be less expensive.  Adding an up next button and having a queue would add efficiency. When you want to hear a song you have to click it and that might take you out of the playlist that was playing. Happens to me a lot 
Pandora is pathetic. I literally had to delete the app to get it to stop playing garbage.
Pandora USED to be the only music app I would use until recently. Every other day the app crashes and I have to log back in to play music. Also, every few songs the volume gets super low so I have to almost max out the volume on my device and then the next song will be normal so it’ll play extremely loud!!! I will now delete the app and play Spotify from now on!! Very disappointed!
I used to like this app a lot. However, lately every time I start it up, it asks me to to upgrade to premium. I pay for plus so I don’t have to hear adds but now I have to go through Pandora’s add every time I open it up. Recently I opened the Pandora and declined the upgrade and it gave it to me anyway and charged me for too. Now I open it up again and tried to add “plus” back and it gave me premium again. I can’t find any way to stop it without contacting them AGAIN and spending another 45 minutes to stop it and remove the charges. Get it together Pandora. If we don’t want your upgrade stop trying to force it on us.
Whatever safe driver update you did has caused it to freeze and I can't lock it even if I'm not in a car... if i lock my phone it stops. What's the point in having your app now?
All the recent updates have changed the mobile experience.  I used to be able to play in my car but the app no longer connects (via Bluetooth or cable) to my vehicle’s on board Pandora option. It used to connect seamlessly and was great but now after recent updates, multiple connection attempts and massive frustration I give up and use Apple Music. When it does connect it no longer plays in the background. If I change to a navigation app the music stops playing and I start the entire connection fiasco all over again.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble you’re experiencing.

Pandora come thru on time with these jams!🎧
I have been a paid subscriber for years and I don’t know if it’s the recent updates or that it’s not readily compatible with the iPhone X but the app is unusable. Only the lock screen controls pause or play music. Sometimes if I manually lock the screen music stops. Please fix this or I’ll be cancelling my membership.
Recent update makes the app almost unusable. Really frustrating   I have used both Spotify and Pandora. Both are very similar. Except the browse section on the app that Spotify has and Pandora does not. In my music it just piles up all the stations I have listened to recently. It doesn't show what I have added. Theres literally no organization. Issues with rights to music keeps me from adding stuff to playlists. It's just endless annoyances. I'll be cancelling and going back to Spotify. 
Just had the new update. It is worse!! I can listen to 2 minuets of music and then it will freeze or shut down completely. I just want my pandora back! Please fix it!  Old Review: I have to restart it over and over just to get it to play. Then it plays a few songs freezes my phone for a few seconds and closes out and I have to restart it over and over again. I love Pandora. Please fix the bugs! 
Since the last update a week ago, Pandora is definitely not functioning properly.  It does freeze when first opened on my iPhone, then have to shut it down and open again.  Also, it no longer allows me to jump to the next song (which we pay for) using my ear phones; I have to remove the iPhone from it’s holster and do it on the screen (very annoying when it’s being used during my run or workout times).  Also, I cannot pause it, it has to be completely shut down from the iPhone.  Previously when the ear phones were unplugged, Pandora would pause automatically, now it just keeps playing through the phone speaker.  As others have said, very disappointing especially because it worked well before the most recent ‘upgrade’.  Please fix it!!!!
Pandora app has been working fine then all of a sudden when my phone screen locks, the music stops, when I try to multitask, the music stops, if the app minimizes, the music stops. This is not OK! The point is to have music going while I do other things. I’m not going to leave my phone screen on and the app open. I’ll just use another music source. This is so annoying!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble.

I’ve been listening to music through pandora for a while and I’m one of those bass lovers. But I can’t adjust the amount of bass through the app:( Spotify does an equalizer so catch up please
Every other song thief is an ad, and it crashes all the time. This app is crap.
I have used Pandora for years. I’ve probably had it since it came out. Now every time I used the phone and either lose service or use another app at the same time or even just take a call, Pandora not only crashes, but crashes me entire phone! If I’m in a bad service area, my GPS on my phone doesn’t pick back up. I travel a lot for work and for pleasure and losing my GPS when I can’t get it back (or even when I can, but I have to look at my phone to do it because I’M DRIVING) is super dangerous. Please fix this.
I love Pandora. Use it everyday, but this new update now has me not using it. I can only listen to it until my screen goes black. No longer can I listen to it and have my screen locked. What is happening!?
Since the latest update I cannot play music once I go to another app or my phone goes into power save. I cannot connect to blue tooth reliably and without a great deal of restarting.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Sorry for any trouble.

Hate the blue background, would prefer to see more of the album artwork.
It’s so incredibly annoying that every time I install a new update it turns off my advanced settings for higher quality audio and for explicit content.  If that was fixed it would be a 5 Star app.
So easy to use over the other streaming services
The app crashes ALL. THE. TIME. No matter where I am or whether I’m connected to internet or not it will crash probably

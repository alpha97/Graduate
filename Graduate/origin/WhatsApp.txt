This app has changed the lives of millions of individuals, particularly in third world countries, by allowing them to stay in touch in real time. I’m a great fan!
Nice job
This is my all to app. It seem to get better and better with each new feature and update. If I can make one suggestion on a feature that will be perfect for extra added security... give us the option to allow conversations to be delete after its read with a custom timer we can control between 1 - 60 seconds and the option to it off if we decide.
I love WhatsApp! I’ve used it several times to communicate with other friends that don’t own any other social media like Snapchat or Instagram. However for the friends that do not own iPhones neither I like to feel like we are still texting over iMessage. I know many other apps with this feature but not quite as clean as WhatsApp. The feature I am hinting at is the ability to change the chat bubble color. The light green does sometimes get boring or make me think of an older app off the iPod from way back when. If we had the ability to change the color of the chat bubble color I could change the color anytime I wanted and wouldn’t get bored and eventually overtime ask the people I’m texting to switch to an alternative app.
Be aware if you are on a Whatsapp call and you decide to either watch a person’s Status or even watch a video from a Whatsapp conversation, your call will fade and hangup.   Another thing is occasionally as you are typing it freezes for a few seconds and then continues to respond to your feedback.  Lastly if you have your bluetooth headset connected and you pick up a Whatsapp video call or audio call, whatever bluetooth handset you have will disconnect upon answering the call or even making the call. This happens randomly throughout the day.   iPhone 7 Plus iOS 11  Whatsapp version 2.18.30 
While this app might be great for learning another language, it is completely disgusting how people send you inappropriate videos or pictures and you can’t do anything to stop it. I’ve tried reporting it to whatsapp, but they don’t care.
Can we have raise to listen for audio messages in whatsapp like in imessage Thanks 
👍👍
WhatsApp has been so long here and haven’t included the password protected launch. Privacy of people is huge concern. Alot of people need password protection of their conversion.
Loving this more especially the status part. Wish it would be extended to one minute
I dont know whats the hell wrong with the apple whatsapp version , why is the android version always a step forward ?,  At first it didnt used to upload written status and now it doesnt upload videos as a status ,,,.,?!!!! 
I can’t hear the phone ring when I call someone. So I never know if it’s connected or not! Please fix 😪
Donde estas te busco y no te encuentro
Please give more notification alerts on iphones plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Excelente para mantenerse en contacto con familiares y amigos.
Good app
Looks like the option to create groups was removed in a recent update.
Keep up the great work!!!🍻
Add font types - colors- show on status the songs played either on the music player or soundcloud/youtube
Fix the problem sir calls r not connecting as it is suppose to do
It was never as good as iMessage but somehow the compression algorithm seems to have gotten worse. Will re-rate to 5 stars if fixed.

Best way to communicate internationally
I use WhatsApp a lot. That’s very useful for me. I can talk to people around the world with them. I really appreciate it
No sé porque no tienen esa herramienta/configuración activada en iPhone 5, no puedo dibujar encima de las fotos, ni escribir textos grandes, no podrían implementarlo en iPhone 5(?
Hey guys, could you please fix the issue where the GIFs become too pixelated to even see what’s going on with them? Thank you!
This app needs new things to be implemented it’s getting boring because it hasn’t changed a bit for over 2 years nobody uses status and just add a new thing you need something that sets you apart from iMessage, Messenger, we chat and others I will put 5 stars if you implement something new and fun but for now 1 star is too much for this app
Good application but we need to have the possibility of deleting sent messages from the inbox of everybody at any time not only up to 7 minutes
The application is amazing,  it's literally a game changer.  Thank you WhatsApp. 
منتازن جداً
nice
Kindly update the app to enable us do group conference calling that veryone call share he or her view  We need live WhatsApp video and group live video as well thank.... 
I wanted to delete a message that I sent but then I decided to delete it, but it never gave me the option of “delete for everyone” there’s only “delete for me”. I checked if my app was updated and it is so I don’t know why it doesn’t give that option

i used to be able to search any whatsapp messages instantly. now it just takes forever to load (preparing results 1%-100%) why is this? please improve.
Thank you whatsapp for amazing job. Because of this apps all the people communicated around the world.😀👍

I fell in love on WhatsApp
Hoy me parece favuloso los mensajes y las fotos!!
Nothing like WhatsApp, I got reconnected with my after 23 years of without knowing his whereabouts 👌👍👍
La nueva actualización de iphone 4 donde dice que cuando edites fotos y vídeos le das al icono de la cara feliz pero en el iphone 4 no sale el icono de la cara feliz 29/2/18
*BACKGROUND ACTIVITY* drains 75% of my iphone 6s+ battery I charge my phone *TWICE A DAY* !! 
Anxious to see more improvements specially allowing doing phone calls through the application as this service is either not available in some countries, or not fully reliable in some others. Thanks
This app is truly amazing , thanks for let me reconnect with my family and friends all over the world
Una de las mejores aplicaciones me encanta ❤️❤️❤️
The best and daily used app more than sms or other communication apps.  Just want an additional feature, which is to multi select chats/groups so that i can just clear/delete/archive them in just a few steps and not wasting time. Currently have to select group chats individually to clear the chat.  Hope the feature can be integrated in the near future. 
Извинили функции, стало очень тяжело пользоваться. Сейчас стараюсь в Вайбер друзей не принимать, не удобно стало пользоваться
To confirm your number you need to have the thing that the app is trying to replace.
It has helped me connect to the world !
Considero deberían buscar la manera de poner un estado oculto estando en línea.
Why doesn’t this have Touch ID security like telegram?? What’s the deal? Integrate it.

The same interior design for decades and its internal control has not changed for several years, why there is no night mode option
Glitch happens when you send message it scrols down by itself (ios 10.3.3)

I like this
I want group call like on messenger...
Thanks
What’s aap
Feb. 27th 2018, notification problem is STILL happening. Is anything being done about this, at all? 🤔  Ever since the last update, there are times that I close the app and don’t get an alert or notification and don’t know anyone has messaged me until I decide to open the app. I couldn’t figure out why this was happening until I actually paid attention when I closed it one day. I noticed that when I swipe to close, which I always do, I’d sometimes get an instant notification that says “when you swipe to close, you may not get notifications” or something. What’s up with that? I always swipe to close, so why does it mess up my alerts and notifications on some closes, but not others? 🤔 I’d like to always get notified unless I turn off notifications, myself. It’d be great if this issue could be fixed at some point since we are in 2018, now. Thanks! 
Hagan los emojis Más Grande Por Favor y también que tengan vida seria excelente 👌🏾
Great app but need to be able to edit a sent message in case you misspelt something etc.  You can do this in telegram.
This is basically imessage when you’re texting someone that has an android. Can’t see why you would use this with someone who has an iPhone but great for android to iPhone.
Best App for real communication
Please make ability to block number in a group a reality. Its no point blocking a number for individual but in a group it still active.
How about 3 way video calls?
Thanks!
Buen servicio
I have been using WhatsApp for 4 years now and started having problems back in December. I would open WhatsApp and it would tell me out of no where that it had deleted all of my chats and would try to restore them (it crashed and didn't work) this happened many times. I now lost very important chats that meant so much to me and am very very frustrated.
WhatsApp is awesome!
Are use this app a lot to correspond with people I work with in Europe it’s very good if you have accessible Wi-Fi
It’s perfect I get to communicate with family over the world. I would suggest to be able to send money through here. It wouldn’t be bad at all
Ringer volume of WhatsApp video call is so low that I almost every time missed it. There is no separate option to increase volume for video call. Audio calls ringer volume is same as phone call’s ringer volume. Please help!!
I REALLY APPRECIATE USING YOUR MESSENGER I.E(WhatsApp) BUT! THERE IS NO WhatsApp FOR IPAD AIR WHICH IS REALLY ANNOYING...PLEASE MAKE THE MESSENGER AVAILABLE FOR IPAD AIR THAT WOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL                   THANKS!!! 
O melhor aplicativo de celular que existe! Ligações por tempo ilimitado e perfeita conexão! Love WhatsApp 💚💚💚
No my 100MB update will not be free of charge or possible when traveling through central america. You can't force such a short update cycle on your customers when you are a messenging app! Also 100MB? You should be ashamed!
مشكلته بس منبع الاشاعة
My aunt is a missionary nun with the Daughters of St. Paul. She told me about this app it is the bomb. I have been telling everyone I know about this great app
I’ve been using WhatsApp for years now, never had a single problem. Just wish it had Face ID to enter the app.
أفضل تطبيق تواصل اجتماعي
حصل لي من الامس لهذا اليوم دخول شخص غريب على  الواتس أپ متجاوزاً بعبارات نابية قبيحة والنتيجة أني لم أقف على عنوانه لأقدم بالشكاية والإخبار القانوني عليه . 
Simple and practical messaging. Love the ability to reply to specific messages and to be able to BIU (although since when does U = strike through?)
Best app ever
Amazing
My son was in Canada, and chatting was so easy!! Sending pics too
Good
If this thing is secure, then why a sign people send ruins the app? Should fix that.
Sometimes calls don’t announce. Everything is turned on and nothing. Then I go in app and see missed calls. Wth?
I think conference call on video and audio is also important. thanks
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Me quita esta aplicación porque puedes mandarle mensajes a tu amigos que tú as visto de ase mucho y también familia
We are constantly disconnected

I think there should be an option to select online drive or id other than iCloud for backup/restore.
It’s a great app
I’ve been trying to update my WhatsApp for a very long time and it doesn’t allow me to. And it saying the old version I’m using is gonna expire in three days. I’ve tried everything possible to update it but it isn’t working. I need help!🤦🏽‍♀️😒
غااع
So recently I discovered we could delete messages to others peoples once it has been sent but it seems you cannot do it anymore- why? Is there something I missed to do? Thank you
However, it gets cut off completely during the conversation and we have to redial again. That is annoying.
I noticed a problem with recording a video to send.  The phone times out regardless and the recording is cancelled.  Thanx
Dowload or upgrade Whats App?
Cool
Buena
For text and calls
Thanks to WhatsApp for connecting families and friends all over the world! Thanks also for contributing for the expression of taughts and ideas with more freedom and liability 
It is so cool who ever created it is a genius 🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇first place
No issues the short time I’ve used it to msg internationally
There is something wrong with the new update ! When you are on a call and you check your friend’s status the call automatically fails ! Please fix it , that does not seem right .
It’s great but glitches very often.
Pretty much a good way to text everyone, the calling isn't the best but as long as you have a decent wifi it works
Is there any way we can pause the auto play of status photos and any option to save the status images or videos.
So Good.
FIX THE ISSUE SO WE CAN REPLY ON OUR SPPLE WATCH !!!
The concept of this app is great.  But there is always a connection problem.  So what good is it!
Love
If I don’t have the phone in my possession I would still like to use it on my Mac. Will give it five stars when Whatsapp makes this possible.   Great app otherwise and very super convenient. 
U can hardly hear the person calling
This app lets me talk to friends and family it’s also free it deserves a five star rating it’s one of the best apps I have!

Good app
Recently when I was in video call, it crashes and sometimes it's not visible.
Sólo me da la opción de comentar en texto, un estado fotográfico y/o de video. Sería bueno que implementarán las notas de voz los archivos y las fotos como opciones de respuesta a los estados en fotos o videos de la app.  Gracias. 
والله التطبيق ذا فنانه🤚🏻
Keeping in touch with family is just so easy❤️
obe of the best app i've ever seen
Very goid app
نتنمنى  تحسين   مكالمات     وتكون  المكالمات   واضحه   بأقل  كمية  نت
😂🍳📞
Muy buena app me gusta mucho
اكثر من رائع
Seems to work quite well! No complaints 😊 
It's a great application that made revolution in the communication world.
Me and my group used messenger ALOT, however WhatsApp improves over it in every single way, (with the exception of lack of a meme chooser). For one it’s 100% free and you can send as many texts as you want, within the U.S or Canada. You can add up to 256 members instead of messengers 10, Admin rank helps organize the chat and stop troublmakers. Encryption is sweet too! Overall A+!
اتمنى ذلك
Wish they gave you an option to choose to see or not to see the status of people , sometimes u just don’t want to see certain peoples status please do something
I love this app. Its easy to operate and send files. Beautiful app to keep connect with friends and family.
Nothing bad to say about the app. Works wonders. I just think it would be nice to add an appear offline future on the app.
A veces se cae el sistema
The best for ios users
This app has deleted itself 3 times and 3 times I reinstalled it ❗️wtf WhatsApp ❓
I love the What app because people without unlimited data can communicate with me
Wow like apple and android like yaaaa to hundred star

Loved this app - until I updated in Feb 2018. Now all the gifs I send are degraded to the point they’re almost unwatchable. Too bad, I’ll have to use the native iphone messaging app or email from now on.
I love its cause I can talk to my family that live in Mexico and as I can’t talk Spanish that much and I can voice text then it so awesome and I love it and whoever made WhatsApp is a very smart person
I love this app, keeps me close and in communication with my loved ones
Absolutely THE best way to communicate with friends and family.......the app never disappoints .

Made life easy
Wish I had known about it sooner.
I am from the U.S. and I’ve been out of the country for a year. WhatsApp has been been extremely helpful with being able to stay connected with family and friends! My father isn’t on FB and even my sister’s who are said that they preferred to a see a text on WhatsApp from me rather than a FB message.
Excellent service, I LOVE LOVE it!!!
Amazing. I recommend this app for anyone who is traveling out of their country. Really helpful for people who are proactive with their phones & social media.
Great app to keep in contact with international travelers but it sure takes up a lot of space on my iPhone.
Es lo mejor para mensajería y llamadas
زي الخرا مع التحديث الجديد
There’s one think i don’t like about the app that every time i bring the phone to my ear to listen to a voice message dictation gets activated i don’t know why and i don’t trust whatsapp messenger to send pictures with small details because the quality is (trash)
برنامج حلو
Excellent app
I have no choice but learn how to use it since most of my friends use it. Although I could not say it is infallible, it is a sort of useful when I have WiFi connection.
Clicking on the ‘start new conversation’ button crashes the app. Useless.
I’m very happy with this app and it is so awesome I can’t stop using this app for my iPhone it is the best app I’ve used for years
Dark mode?
Briefly -- texting capability has been terrific, phone connectivity spotty and frustrating.  I like the end-to-end security aspect.
Love Ronal
It keeps me in touch with my family and some very good friends who are scattered all over the world

Last update messed up notifications.
I Notice That We Cannot See Our Status Views If We Don't Have Our Read Receipt Or Last Seen On And I'm Thinking.... What Does Any Of Those Things Have To Do With The Views? It Would Be Great To Be Able To See Who's Viewing Our Statuses And Still Be Able To Mask Our Presence. I Hope This Thought Isn't Dismissed As Unimportant Or Insignificant, But I Just Don't See What Any Of That Has To Do With Views. And I Would Like To See Who's Watching... THANK YOU.
WhatsApp call need more clearance to enjoy your services.
Now I see why Facebook bought WhatsApp for 16 billion
It never lets us down. We love it thank you

Reakky easy to use and can do almost anything with it👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
This is by far the best messaging app send message in an instant I also love that it shows if the person saw and read your message also love the emojis definitely requested for all with iPhone this should be the first app you download. Thank you 
Hello, I really love WhatsApp. But, I feel like there is this wave coming through and I desire customization throughout the app. Like Twitter or telegram has night mode, and telegram has dark and night mode, and I was wondering if you can do like a night mode and other mode options?
Very happy with application. It gets me closer to my friends and family.

Also, thank you for creating a system that works for me, I can call, text, send voice messages♥️, pics, videos, with a fast capacity! I love you guys, if the CEO of whatsapp is single, please marry me. (Needs to be younger than 45)😘👌🏼🎉

I didn’t find the app very user friendly. Was not able to have phone conversations or real time text messaging
I have family all over the world and WhatsApp is the primary way (aside from commenting on each other’s Facebook posts) that we communicate- whether it’s texting or calling.  The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is because with the latest upgrade it crashes and when reopening the app anything I was in the middle of typing is erased- which is extremely frustrating if I’ve written anything longer than a sentence to try & recreate it.

Love and work fine
Great application
This app is great, i can text my aunt for once.There’s one thing, though; when i try to read an audio message my app crashes. This problem started yesterday while i was texting my friend about stuff and she sent me an audio. When i first tried to listen to it, it crashed. The second time it worked then every other time it would crash. I hope this gets fixed.  Sincerely, A person 
Me encanta esta aplicación esta súper
Videochat doesnt work well
Great
Love this application but lately when I use it no one can hear me at the another side.... very disappointed!!!
deberían agregarme que te avisen cuando se conecta una persona y está en línea
Estoy intentando abrir el WhatsApp y no quiere abrir, quiero saber si esto tiene solución?
We need Auto night mode
This app has made it easy to work with clients all over the world.  I highly recommend it! SpiritSenseLLC.com 
Very good
I'm a undergraduate student and I recently broke my phone. And currently i need this app for one of group projects in class so I acquired another phone from a friend, but because I am only able to accept messages through wifi and was never able to receive a call or message for the required access code. Preventing me from finish school work I've put my time and effort into my schooling. Ive been happy with GroupMe in the past but it is a terrible app to download if you're going to get a new phone.
Thanks you 😹👍
Lest go very good WhatsA
The best
Thank you Facebook for buying WhatsApp! As a shareholder I thank you! Good call!
No way to go offline when you don’t need people still can see online. I even get call when my iPhone is in Do Not Disturb mode that annoys me really bad. I wish I can go offline anytime.
Cada vez que salgo de la aplicación al estar en una llamada sale que se a producido un error en la llamada. Esto me pasa seguido en varios terminales.

I used to love WhatsApp really cool app until it keeps telling me voice recorder not available! It just does it with an specific contact, I’m recording my message and when I release the button to send it doesn’t let me and it deletes the message! Totally frustrating!!!

Thanks for your good working developers,but the latest update has a crash and lag. 😬 fix it ASAP 
I used to use many IM applications but not of them maintain their charm . I use WhatsApp because it is simple and lightweight , fast and reliable and won’s everyone’s heart..
The reason I give you one star it’s because I only can use this what’s up with wi-fi  I would love to use it without Wi-Fi

Tiene mejor conexión q massenger cuando haces llamadas y es lo mejor solo q tienen q arreglarlo un poco más modernizar el sistema gracias pero me encanta
The app keeps on refusing to load on my iPhone 7+, forcing me to uninstall and reinstall. Hate this app. I use it because people, like sheeps, are blinded by this. I’d rather use BBM. I wish people realize this is crap and use other apps. If it locks up one more time, whoever doesn’t use BBM, won’t get in touch with me. Deleting for good.

This annoying popup appears for every single call that I make.
روعه
Got kicked off and impersonated
The best part of my time...
For some reason there is no sound when a voice call or video call comes through sometimes since this latest update. Please fix the issue.
Best messaging app so far
Muy buena aplicación
Excellent app,enjoying it
I have some issues & one major issue with this app. First, it makes you use you phone number. I don't like that. I prefer the apps that give you one rather than using your existing number.  It's not privacy friendly. This is a huge one for me. When I installed the app I blocks it's access to my contacts because I don't want everyone to know I installed this app. I don't care for chatting with some of them. Still, the person I least wanted to talk to was the very first person to text me. Even though that person is not in my contacts.   It should have the ability be invisible to anyone you don't manually notify that you have this app. Preventing others from being notified that you have installed this app even if they have you in their contacts. Just because you have them in your contacts or they in theirs it doesn't mean you want to talk to them. I'm pretty sure that I'll be deleting this app for good.  And what's up with the little tiny mic button/icon at the bottom of the screen? I hope that they'll make it smaller in the next update (sarcasm). May be I’m used to apps like TalkBox and Zello that have much bigger mic buttons. 
Super app
I received a text from someone and the moment I opened it the application crashed and to solve this issue I had to reinstall the application, losing all of my chats.  Fix it.

In AFGHANISTAN, though i was a duck out of water when my AT&T service discontinued.    WHATAPPs saves the DAY with chat and talk feature.    Just talked to my son.  I back in business.   Thanks WhatsApp 
Nice
My family and friends travel a lot.  The BEST way to stay in touch is with WhatsApp.  Easy to use, free, and dependable.
Been using what’s app since the launch. Love the app all around. But with change of times, I’m feeling stagnant with the hardware updates. Why are my Apple Watch’s options so limited and next to useless, and apps like Facebook messenger and Instagram have options that aren’t even present on what’s app for my Apple Watch.  Still awaiting watch support. 
Love whatsapp! It is the best way to be connected with my family and friends! what else can we ask for?
Loved this app while at YAGP 2018!! Our dance company patents are able to keep tract of when dancers needed to be on stage! Very easy to use! We will definitely be using at the next competition!
I love WhatsApp it’s a good app use it 💗
Dear whatsapp With your unsecure app and my stuped frindes and littele stuped India latter . I loss a three years conversation,photos and important masseges 😡 
Good
How did I not know this app existed before?!
I’m not sure why whatsapp had this update. There are things on it that doesn’t even make sense like the video call button that replaced the chat button when you’re on an audio call. The video call doesn’t even let you switch to it and it’s literally got no functionality being on that screen. And I’m not sure if it’s a bug in the version but everytime I share/play a media while on call, the call gets disconnected. This has happened several times since I upgraded my whatsapp version. I would love it if the app would roll back to its previous version.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Thank you for reporting this issue.

Depois da atualização não recebo notificação de chamada de vídeo, mesmo  não estando no silencioso.
I love this app so much I’m in  the 6 grade and it lets me talk to all my friends that has an android phone or Samsung. I can now FaceTime the people that don’t have an apple phone and it it great for all kid maybe ages 9+.
We need unlimited groups since we send jobs for free  We have more than 50 group  One group will do it if you make it unlimited 
الواتس اب جميل واعطيه 10/‘\, شكرا على هذا البرنامج😝
Keep the greatness happening!
Super 👍
Hola, qué tal! Estoy teniendo problemas para entrar a al app. Sucede que cada vez que intento entrar me saca al instante, quisiera saber a qué se debe. 
The whatsapp have a problem when i call and i want to view the story .. the call qill be ended and crash the app please fix it
Whenever I send a gif to any of my contacts, it gets really blurry while the actual gif is HD. I did not experience that on my Android phone. Please fix it as soon as possible for a better rating. Thank you.
I heavilly use your product for the past year, and the “Media, Links, and Docs” filter is very useful. I have found myself wanting there to be a “Voice Message” filter here as well, to easilly search them. I’ll give a five star if that feature was included.
Easy  Ergonomic  Essentially 
nice
La última actualización no me deja borrar los mensajes para todos

Fantastic app all round. But is it possible to make an incognito mode? Sometimes I just want to view user stories without showing I am online. Otherwise, this is a 5 star app.
Terribly bugged, I can’t even add contacts.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Thanks for the report. Please update your iOS if you have not done so already by going to iPhone Settings > General > Software Update. Please let us know if you are still encountering any problems.

I love this app. I use it over any other communication app. Please create an Apple watch version. I rarely use the Iphone messaging app and would love to get notifications from Whats App on my watch. Please! 😊
In general the app is great in every way but only if you guys could update your media compression codes.. like seriously the quality of most gifs out there are bad in general ... and whenever I try to send it through WhatsApp it gets worse and you can barely see the content. Don’t make the media compression codes apply for gif since it’s already in poor quality most of the time.
Bdbbfbfbdbfbdbfbb
After the new update Whatsapp become not stable and always crash. I can’t open it for 3 hours . Any solution please?
It will be nice to have WhatsApp application to restrict who sees you online, it should be a bit more in the control of the user rather than the public.   The online display needs to be eliminated. 
This app is very good and very easy
Whatsapp crashing on my iPhone X please fix it
Muy excelente
No me deja entrar y me saca , bye
I love WhatsApp me and my family have group chats and we post but I would like for you to make some changes I would like filters like on Snapchat please other than that I love it it’s perfect .
Downloaded upgrade to whatsapp and now cannot use application
احيانن ماتجي اشعارات
You will love this app! Definitely recommend!!!
WHATSAPP ES LO MAXIMOOOO, sobretodo para los VENEZOLANOS!!! Gracias 💛💙❤️
Love the end to end encryption and the functionality.
Nit work mic on video call on iphone6
Their are so many different apps now ! But the easiest.. best .. clear .. friendly user .. connect distances .. no commercials in your face .. is this app .. I CANT BE WITHOUT ANY WHERE IN TGE WORLD . ❤️
This review is long over due... WhatsApp has come a long way and is amazing all around. I had Voxer before this app and when I first downloaded WhatsApp (years ago), and for awhile, I still liked Voxer better...  BUT... WhatsApp has stepped up their game big time! WhatsApp is better than the likes of Voxer in ALL aspects except one: The ability to speed up audio messages that Voxer has (x1, x2, x3 and x4) is such an amazing feature that it keeps me using Voxer for audio messages only and WhatsApp for everything else. It’s a night and day difference being able to listen to messages at a faster rate.   Please incorporate a speed up feature similar to Voxer! The second you do will be the second I delete Voxer once and for all. 
Super Like
The people don't have a live
There’s a problem with the app try to deal with it
When writing I seem to get a lag when trying to write separate sentences. I seem to be writing faster than what the app can handle, it only happens on the app. I have an iPhone X.
لا يوجد قابليه لمسح الرساله المرسله الا لوقت قصير جدا وهذا الخيار غير جيد مقارنه مع نفس الخيار في تطبيقات اخرى مثل التلكرام والفايبر بحيث يمكنك مسح رسالتك المرسله من صفحه المرسل اليه متى تشاء
Mi WhatsApp esta teniendo problemas al abrir la aplicación, se cierra automáticamente
Crash last night i lost all data
Test your app before releasing an update! No longer works on iPhoneX! You can receive messages but cannot reply.
The ONLY thing missing in whatsapp is the ability to send full size images. We need that ASAP
😍😍
Hello Telegram!
Simplesmente fecha o app quando aperta para abrir ele... quando resolver o problema mudo a avaliação
The app is great and essential, i use it every day. But the design is just horrible and dated.
Great and good connection
This update is not working on my iphone. It keeps crashing. Doesn’t open up 
After the last ipdate, my whatsapp is crashing every 5 minutes and closes Please solve the problem ASAP Im using iPhone 5S Thanks 
thanks
Can’t get enough! I Use the FaceTime with friends who don’t have an iPhone.
Love this app since years I have been using it with family, friends and mainly for business flawlessly. But unfortunately today my app stopped working and since hours I can not open WhatsApp. I HOPE YOU GUYS ARE READING THIS AND WILL DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT RAPIDLY!!! Like I said, this is the most used app among  hundreds I have. PLEASE DO SOMETHING!!! Thx  Cheers 
Good!!
I love it, so great easy to use
Cada día sorprende esta aplicación, tantos los que hoy día que la usamos, y la competencia va ha quedar perplejo con lo que viene...
I like this app a lot, it helps me keep in touch with my family and friends. I can call anyone who has the WhatsApp app anywhere. Thanks!
La app se me cierra sola, no me deja entrar en ocaciones y se cierra, cuando le doy al icono de estados se cierra la app, nunca me había pasado, tengo un iPhone 6s iOS 11.2
I just have to say one thing Our Rights have been taken away from us and regardless if they can’t use it against us in court, they can find out everything you’re doing, everything you’re saying and follow you and do everything like that! So, with WhatsApp I just feel a little bit safer about my personal business, thank you Jesus for such an app!
Just installed the lastest update and the app totally disappeared??? Still taking up space and still comes up when I search, but it doesn’t open... it’s gone...

I’m receiving messages on whatsapp and everytime i try to open them the app closes right away. You need to fix this asap!
This app is a great secured way to text!  As you can imagine, the internet phone calls are sometimes hard to hear and they drop. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a secured way to text and occasionally talk.
Wonderful way to stay close
I love this app soooo much ❤️ I like it because I can chat with my friend with no problems. I haven’t got into any problems till now so it’s interesting🧐🤩🤩
Great social media with free calling from anywhere in the world
The app left to run. I try to open it’s not. App close automatically.
When every other app can do that.. i switched to telegram long back which is much better.. just waiting here until all friends/groups move too .. whatsapp grow up!
My son was visiting another country and we use this to communicate. The phone calls from that country to my house were clearer than the local phone calls made. The messages were delivered quickly without any problems.
Love what’s app can chat with my friends so go chez it out on apple store 💗!
Make easy way to see dp and status

I have a friend in Norway that I wanted to be able to stay in touch with after getting rid of FB.  This app works perfectly and it’s free.  No complaints here.  Thanks for a great app!

When you get an update .. there should be improvements and more updates about this app which should be more awesome , but in reality it’s the opposite , I tried to call my mom today which is kinda urgent , and my app is up to date but the call just won’t work as my net is full ! What kind of nonsense app is this ?? If you want to have some updates on this .. you should be having the same abilities and all , and after updating my app the call whenever I want to make just won’t work ! It turns out to be that this update just ruins my calls and nothing more ........... get real whatsapp producers ..
Lo mejor
Amazing app but can you guys work on allowing the long videos to be dissected into various parts on its own when posting on the status for iPhone
can’t even open the application after the update.
Love the app it’s the best. I connect with family and friends all the time and it’s super easy to use. One thing that could be added is the ability to turn off your online status, like it used to have before a previous update.   Thanks!! 
People of WhatsApp app please look into your security issues better software has to be updated and more secure back at you security boards which recognition possibly face recognition the people on this talk app that you don’t want thank you
Telegram creates a lot of cool things and WhatsApp copy them (like WhatsApp Web, the possibility to send files and now in-app notifications answers). Some Telegram features:  • Channels: a new way to chat (Viber has a feature like this) • Bots: they're apps inside Telegram!!! That's fantastic! And anyone can make a bot without encoding. • Inline bots: search by photos, videos, gifs, Wikipedia and even translate or write in bold, italic or fixedsys; all these in the chat bar • Supergroups: five thousand people in one group (!!!!!); and you can delete or edit your messages • Chat links: you don't need to add everybody to your group, just send you group link and when you friend click in it he will be redirected to your group (after years, now WhatsApp do this too) • Answers: you can answer to a specific message in a chat, avoiding confusion and "flood" (the same: after years on Telegram, WhatsApp copied) • Stickers: not the horrible Facebook stickers; Telegram's stickers are awesome and, again, anyone can make a sticker for Telegram • GIFs: it doesn't have nothing to say about, everybody loves they • Nickname: you can choose a @nickname if you don't want to share your cellphone number with unknown people • More security • Save chats on the cloud • Occupy almost nothing of your cellphone's storage space • Use Telegram in your cellphone, tablet or web (Telegram Web is so so so so so so much better than the horrible WhatsApp Web) independently: you don't need your cellphone to use Telegram Web, for example.  I could stay here all day long saying all Telegram advantages and probably I forgot some of then.  MOVE TO TELEGRAM! 
Mmmmm
iPhone 6s 11.2.5 version whatsapp updated  while on cellular network message shows while trying to downloading media says cant download..... then i have to try 3 times after that it will start downloading & phone get stuck while trying to open the media. 
No me gusta que cada vez que hago una llamada me sale error de llamada,me gustaría que al menos arreglaran eso por qué de resto es una aplicación excelente
When a photo is in my gallery its. Very clear  But when i upload it on whatsapp it seems like a low quality picture 
Telegram has bubles in the discussions  And that looks mich much much much bettttttttter 
My son just moved to Manila & this app makes it financially possible for us to communicate with each other on a daily basis.
Es genial Gracias wpp
Our son is in Africa for 2 years. He learned about the Whatsup App shortly before leaving, and made sure all his relatives were set up before he left. We’ve been texting and Skyping him while in South Africa for free. It has been a blessing to us, and I’m sure he feels the same being able to see his family while away so long. The quality is unbelievable! This is an amazing service!! We feel enormously blessed to be a part of this service! It is a privilege to write a review for a company like Whatsup!!
tidak bisan sinkron ke apple watch
So honored to be able to talk to my friends and family for free. Thank you so much
Okay right to the point the game wont let me even use my real code and that messes it up so i cant even use this app to contact my friends Whatsapp pleas respond ASAP so we could work out my problem
I travel quite a bit all over the world- The more you travel the more you become friends with people from all corners of the planet- it’s a great app to have to keep in touch and connect with those people as well as your people back home- I don’t think I’ve run in to anyone who does not have WhatsApp- a great tool to pack with and hit the road!!!
This app works just as well as my regular message app. Talking was a little lower quality but for wifi it’s way better than nothing! Works internationally.
Goog 👌🏻
New update makes my WA crash!!! Fix it now!!!!
ควายมาก
Muy buena aplicación cada vez estoy mas cerca de los que están lejos 😁😁😁
Is group call possible ?
WhatsApp ha cambiado las comunicaciones para bien y de forma gratuita, gracias a ellos me comunico a diario con mis hijos que no viven cerca, continúen así
I am enjoying using app Thanks 
I like this application
Súper hablo con mi hija desde Hong Cong.
I’m very thankful for this App me ,my friends and family enjoy everyday connecting
I’ve been a WhatsApp user since it came out. Seeing a lot of updates it’s been going great and outstanding. Keep it up, I hope to see group video soon.
الفيديوهات بطيئة التحميل  والحاله للواتس تحتاج تطوير 
I love you 🖤💜🖤
WhatsApp has always been the chat app for me that works fine, but is slow to adopt new and useful chatting features. Ultimately frustrating me.   The most recent update just included the ‘@‘ function to call out a user within a group chat (finally). A feature that has been built in to WeChat for years and years. For an app that is primarily used for group chatting, it’s unreal how long this took.   Now let’s see how long it takes them to add ‘tapback’ functionality. Another huge timesaver in chatting.... 
Great app, everything is fine. Just one thing I want is a feature to change other people’s name colors in a group chat. It’s just something that would be cool to see added :)
I was already impressed.  They continue to add meaningful features and often correct design blunders.  Next up, I hope they enable audio messages from the car.
Se cierra!!! No vale!!!!
Good
I really like using this app for free calls because it gives me the best connection when reaching my parents abroad. However, while I’m not sure if anyone else keeps facing this same problem, I never have the app to notify me the calls, whether my phone is on silent or not! Not to mention that it does the same even if I don’t “swipe up” the app on my iPhone. It goes the same with my parents, and usually I have no choice but to keep turning to a different app (which is building up its call connections real fast) to make a call abroad. Tbh, I really think Whatsapp should be focusing more on NOTIFYING (me) any calls rather than focusing on the feature similarly resembling that of Instagram/Snapchat stories.
I love this app!!! It’s so convenient, It tells you if the other person checked the message, it sends right away, The best APP FOR TEXTING EVER!
ممتاز
Awesome app!
It’s good for what it’s worth.
Very good and reliable
1. Allow for iPads and maybe laptops. 2. Allow pinning certain messages, that’ll help our organization. 
WhatsApp is a very useful app. Everybody has downloaded and has a WhatsApp account, it’s true. But it has become very boring to use. The interface screams update and it needs more fun features that could make conversations more interesting, intuitive and fun. Stickers, video messages and better voice message support are some of the things that could be implemented and could improve the quality of the app. Eliminate the need of iCloud and Google Cloud to be able to save conversations, and make a “WhatsApp Cloud” or something of that origin so it’s easier for us to be able to use the app and not lose anything when changing devices or numbers, even if it’s from Android to iOS or viceversa. Just entering our profile information and confirming it from our next device should be enough to let us open and use that “WhatsApp Cloud” storage.  I’m really looking forward into the future of this very useful and popular app. 
Every time someone posts a picture, it goes to my photos app. Why is that and how can I stop it?
جميل

أنا مشترك ببرنامج الواتس أب الرائع ولكن يوجد لي ملاحظة وهي أني عندما أرسل أي رسالة من الواتس من جوالي لاتخرج هذه الرسالة من الواتس حتى أخرج من برنامج الواتس اب ثم أعود وأدخل عالبرامج مرة أخرى فماهو السبب أرجو الإجابة وجزاكم الله خيرا
There’s a serious bug with 3D touch, it’s waaaaayyy too much sensible! When used, peek happens, and the pop happens immediately after! And if you managed to get only peek, the app freezes completely!!! That doesn’t happen with any other app, only WhatsApp... And you guys almost doesn’t bring any new feature! It’s already time for iPad support, for Christ sake! New wallpapers would be good too!
This is the best messenger in the world omg😱😱😱😱😱😱
Great service. Can I get back to my app now ?
‏يحدث تواصل اجتماعي بين بعض
Dislike the recording function, recently switched from android to iPhone and I dislike Whatsapp on an iPhone! Especially the recording button, so easily stops recording when im not done. Never had this problem on the android. Another thing, it doesnt allow me to record audio when im connected to Bluetooth, very annoying.
You Guys Should Create Games For Whats App As Well So I Could Play With Some Family And Friends ... Think About It .
Totally satisfied with everything
Awesome app
With WhatsApp I’m connect around the globe with family and friends and I can talk with my family and friends abroad or talk via camera, I advise everyone to try it,!!! Thank you WhatsApp
I just need a revamp, new UI, better emojis, just some innovation plz.
Ever since installing this app. I get alerts that I have a message but when I go to check them there is nothing there🤨🙁
Lo mejor que existe actualmente en las redes sociales e escribe, WASSAP.
The best way to contact family and friends
I have a lot of use for different types of things with it I really enjoy it thank you.
So apparently when you save gifs from google and into your camera roll, then upload them to whatsapp I've noticed they lose a lot of quality when uploaded to the app via "Photos and Videos". Its a shame because I'd like to upload my gifs from my camera roll without losing quality but I dont know if its something to do with the app.
Great app but my problem is whatsapp use so much data in video call so I hope you fix this
Easy to use. Reliable. Great way to stay in touch internationally. Photos and videos send with no problem!
Incoming call is something wrong in new version. The ringtone is so low in volume.
Almost Perfect app, fix this issue:  I keep accidentally hitting the call button and calling people on mistake everyday. I dont know why or how. Please add a lock button so calls wont work until I unlock it. 
- Ringtone for video calls is very low. No way to raise the volume. - Does not connect to car multimedia for both video and audio calls. 
Can’t even see who viewed my post
Good job with the software but sometime  the system hangs with iPhone when you send multiple pictures!!!!!
Sigan mejorando no paren !!
I still haven't been disappointed from new updates for this app.
Awesome
❤️
Me encanta
Need to be able to turn off the call feature and/or restrict it to WiFi only. And please roll back the status function entirely to the old version.
Hello there so iphone x after the last update videos stop frequently also sometimes screen gets smaller in iphone x please update and resolve this issues thanks
This was a good app until Zuckerberg got his greasy paws on it. Now it’s garbage, like everything Facebook touches.
🇯🇲
I love the app okay. I use this app to meet new people all over the world but one thing that i hate well make it two. One of them is the quality of the pictures and videos you post on your story. I upload and share high quality videos and pictures but when you post them to the app it makes everything low quality. It’s so annoying and second is the video duration. 30 seconds it’s too short. I want to oust some fun and funny videos but in order to do that i have to cut it in to pieces which is annoying. WhatApp should make a video last at least 3 minutes. Please read this team WhatsApp I enjoy your app but these two things need to be fixed. Thanks
best app easy
Update to fix bugs that didn’t put check mark in delivered/read messages didn’t work. Before the update I could see marks on when messages were delivered and read. Now it only shows that messages were delivered, not when they are read.  My read receipts are on. 
عالی بود پسر
Qué pasa con WhatsApp que se pone muy lento. Piensa y piensa
Whats wrong sending gifs low poor quaility plz fix it.
This is the worst apdate . Notifications inactive
kankim sıkılmış bu tasarımdan hemen yeni bi tasarım yap da değiştir koçum hadi
Best APP ever
What’s app Global connectivity for peace and progress 
Bom,vocês poderiam deixar o Whatsapp de iOS anteriores supondo iOS 7.1.2 como os de iOS 10 ou até 9,por que as vezes achamos esse Designer incrível...bom,o status mesmo vocês poderiam deixar nós escrevermos algo,ou colocar até emojis...isso ajudaria até demais....quando melhorar isso vocês receberam 5 estrelas
This app has made communicating with family and friends from anywhere in the world. Thank you WhatsApp!!
It would be nice if we could listen to Voice Messages in the background while replying to other persons in other chats.   Background voice messages would honestly be a major plus. 
I was scrolling down the pages in the app and my finger accidentally landed on the stars button for rating What’sApp as I scrolled the page. There’s no way to undo. I rthink I saw one star flash, but it shows three stars, which is at least better, but not enough for What’sApp which does sooo much. Imagine an app that performs so many tasks, avoids so many charges. is not laborious to use, AND is FREE!!! I’ve had other opportunities to rate and have given it 4 stars. That’s the most stars I give unless the app solves an intractable problem, is the only one, or first/best one to do so, and is perfect. Don’t want to dilute the 5 to preserve its value. When I’ve used more of What’sApp I may rate it a 5. It’s close. So if you’re wondering who is the dummy who rated What’sApp an odd 3, it’s me. Sorry. 
Me gustaría que tenga una opción para apagar whats app y continuar usando mis datos móviles
It is fast but doesn't support chanells and doesn't have edite massages ability.
It is the best social application for messaging and voice call.
...to stay in touch with faraway friends and family without using data! Thanks, WhatsApp!
Whatsapp unresponsive when forwarding images and text message to contacts . Please solve it.
جميل جداً
No HD support yet
WhatsApp ha revolucionado las comunicaciones en el mundo .. donde quiera que estemos nos comunicamos con nuestros seres queridos, familiares y amigos .. es extraordinario .. gracias
Audio call get failed. When I’m watching a video.
I love WhatsApp, it s very good. If you can make official WhatsApp for iPad, I think that’s better.  Thanks team! 
Sometimes I don't see any ring when I receive a call on WhatsApp. If I close the app and restart my phone and open the app after the restart, it seems to fix the issue but looks like a bug to me. It is an inconvenience to restart phone Everytime I miss calls.
Anytime I upload a picture of my status, the picture goes blurry. Any help?
I am on iphone x whenever i try to voice or video call it says call failed fix this and I'll give 5 stars
👌🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I only use this app because my family in the states use it. I think it’s ugly and hard to use. I prefer to use kakaotalk. It is so easy to use but WhatsApp is horrible. Even the connection is terrible at times. Will keep using it until something better comes up.
What a great communication tool.!
My read blue buttons don’t show and I’m not the only one with that problem...mine has been like that for quiet a while now I seen someone phone has it working but not mine don’t make sense
Will be great if you add a video call for a group
WhatsApp has been my number one messaging app for almost 4 years now. However, I still find myself going back to iMessage for specific features like games, message reactions, gifs, and more. WhatsApp needs to step up the game in that area! Make it more dynamic and fun! Otherwise, nice app.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Thank you for reporting this issue. Sorry for the inconvenience. Please go to WhatsApp > Settings > Help > Contact Us and describe us in detail what you are experiencing. Additionally, please write "App Store Review" in your description. Thank you for you 
Please rate it back for a 4 +
I would love for the next version to reconsider being able to put a different profile picture for each contact as well as you can do it with the type of sound when a message arrives. Hosea personalized profile picture per contact would be a success
Para android el WhatsApp es mejor
You won't let me out of here without these stolen words. No exit other than write the app; is it more like Vlad or Stalin? Help. Help. 
Please guys consider adding customizable vibrations for notifications. Thanks! 
Es una magnífica aplicación, aparte muy útil.
جميل جميل جميل ع قولة ناصر القصبي👌
I love this app because it allows me to talk to people all over the world without paying real money. It’s fast, easy, great quality pictures and lots of cool features like video chat. My only complaint is a problem with sending and receiving messages. I will send a message to a friend and not receive their reply until hours later when I have sent a new message to check in. Message also fail to send occasionally unless app is open and running. Please fix these issues, and then the app will be perfect :)
Please add group video calls function
High speed❤️
Still no iPad support and WhatsApp web doesn’t detect iPad browser.   You have to force a “request desktop site”.   Furthermore, if you use private browsing you have to re-register each time.  #Failure 
Great job on the program.
البرنامج جميل لكن يحتاج بعض التحسينات مستقبلاً من ناحية عدم وجود التنبيهات عند الخروج من البرنامج بالشكل الفعال كما كان بالسابق
Esta aplicación es sencilla y fácil de manejar. Además que se integra con otras aplicaciones
Your Watts up is more than (i)Mess’gr & Face time plus encryption for free!  Thank you so much!
Awesome
It turns off when on the phone!!!!
It’s better to use
I hate that when I take a picture  or video or that I receive either or,  that it automatically saves to my personal photo gallery on my iPhone!!  Very frustrating! Even tho I change this in settings, it still doesn't work!! Please address!!
sometimes my wifi connection losts, when I'm in a video call with iphone
WhatsApp isn't a Free Messenger. You use your actual phone number to signup and you get double the notifications when your messaged. If this App wasn't a Skin to put over your iMessages, and was real with fake numbers separate from your real one that run on separate notifications, this would be a great App to have.  1 Star ⭐️ for being Pointless.  - BruhMonJee (DJ, Gamer, Entertainer and Reviewer on: SOUNDCLOUD - Twitter - Tumblr - Instagram - Snapchat - AGORA - Wishbone - Pinterest - iTunes/App Store Reviews/Community - Game Center - XBOX/XBOX Market Place Reviews/Club - STEAM/PC Community --- Connect with me on Hempire by looking up BruhMonJee at the community terminal at the Cafe or just find me on any of the sites listed above and send me a message.

It keeps loading without getting me connected. I'm getting annoyed😡. This should be fixed asap👈🏿
I think it’s better if we always can choose “delete for everyone” not just 7 minuets after we send a message
احسن برنامج لحد هاي الحضه
WhatsApp is a best instant messaging you can enjoy using
Es genial la aplicación
Wish videos and photos don’t get downloaded straight to my device and stay on the cloud. Like Instagram for example.
Latest version of WhatsApp not working well with latest iOS update. Voice notes don’t play. Messes with the sensor and phone screen blackens. Whatsapp calls shut the phone down.  Definitely preferring Telegram Messenger to Whatsapp now 
Recomendada
Please make it possible to turn off the in app calls. It's really annoying when people call all the time.
I have been waiting for a feature where i can move my chat backup history from my very old android to iphone but even after years of wait, whatsapp has not added it!
Please please please, the only thing else WhatsApp needs now is a night mode!!!
المميز بشأنه البساطة النطلقة كيف تتراسل و تتبادل الوسائط لأرقام المضافين لديك دون أية رسوم تذكر فعلا واتساب أسلوب حياة يربط الناس كم من عزيز و غال على نفسي كنت أتردد في محادثته فإذا بالواتس يتيح لي عديد خيارات ما بين نص و صوت و فيديو    The special about WA is the simplicity Your contacts calling messaging media etc and for free Whatsapp really connecting people and it becomes a life style 
Easiest way to communicate!
The volume on this app is horrible.
I like thik aap
Best for group chats
My daughter is in the Middle East and I'm getting a fantastic connection.
WhatsApp help me to connect with my far away family.
Amazing App all around, better than anything for texting and even organizing events
Ok
Just amazing!  I keep in touch easily with all my friends and my family. It’s great!
I love whatsapp, helps me to connect qith my family overseas. I’m having issues when i try to video call them, i can hear and see them and they see me too but they cannot hear me. I do not know what is happening. It happen in an iphone 6 with ios 11.2.5. HELP
אפליקציה נהדרת ! כל הכבוד לשירות ולאיכות.  היתה מתאימה לי הירארכיה שונה בהתערבות שיחה בזמן שאני בשיחה נתונה. אני רוצה לקבל אינדיקציה שמישהו  מתקשר אלי , אבל אני לא רוצה שהוא ינתק שיחה תודה לכם 
لاكن نتمنى وضع رمز قفل على نفس البرنامج
Excelente aplicación que ahora no solo puedes comunicarte por mensaje sino que también por llamadas y video llamadas.
It’s perfect to write and play games
This app feels outdated, redesign is a must. Key features like extensions, stickers, message styling etc’ (that exist in other messaging apps, even by the same developers) are either badly implemented or not implemented at all.  Plus stop ruining every photo/video/GIF I’m trying to send... GIF quality is so low it’s just unusable. 
شكرًا لكم
WhatsApp is my favourite chat
أرجو ان تحسنو مكالمات الواتس أب               و شكراً 
So good
I have a problem opening the application since last night Then I updated the app and the same problem existThe app shuts down as soon as I try to open it
Il est fomidable what app :mick cellular
It is a Great way to keep in touch! Been recommended to switch to other apps but find WhatsApp a more convenient tool. Awesomeness. 
Aaa
An do group conference call
The update added CarPlay compatibility, but in my iPhone X, the notification volume for groups is extremely loud, making me disable the feature to not become deaf.
Guys what’s happening with GIF or Videos i send...so bad quality
Excelente aplicación estoy muy alegre de poder usarla y felicidades por hoy mes de la amistad feliz mes de la amistad 2018
I was enjoying the app when I decided to download it and it just disappeared! I’ve been trying to get it back but can’t. Now I can’t keep in touch with my friend! ☹️🤬🙁
So, I upgraded from iPhone 6 to iPhone 7 and WhatsApp is may main app to chat. When I was using it on my iPhone 6 the app got very laggy, especially when writing, now I have the iPhone 7 and the same thing, laggy app when writing.   Are developers doing anything to improve or just making it or worse like the Facebook app that it’s horrible?  Do something about it. 
I love the app but please, stop changing the colors of the contacts in a group message. It keeps confusing me and each time it gets uglier because they get darker and darker and more and more bland
It is nice❤️🧡
Why is my wataap behaving this way
I am very disappointed to discover this week that even though I blocked someone on WhatsApp, when she was added to a group chat her message came through as if she weren’t blocked. This is absolutely ridiculous. I hope this security issue is resolved quickly.

I can get better results with Facebook messenger and it is searchable for friends, this app does not have this feature. I have more friends on other social media networks and this is boring and totally useless this app has to many restrictions. Total ripoff!!!
It’s a great thing ever made
It is better that have a nice graphic and best and live colors. Thank you 
Please add Dark mode !

It is a big help but has limited features compared to Viber:  Viber I can use to make calls anywhere. Has very cute stickers to choose from Has hidden chats and secret chats options. It gives us more options for our privacy than whatsapp. 
I like your app but one thing bothers me I get no notification of a response or text. But I love that you can change the colors of the text background which iMessage can't do.
I love alibaba great networking & can FaceTime any phone including androids, best app ever! Could it get multi calls??

Why I can’t send music to someone eles on Iphone 🤔
Nice
They have good service but hey they can call any one and they have awesome texting
The entire family is loving this app to enjoy France w our college daughter! And to know she is safe. At little expense is a bonus!
Excellent
Need redesign ASAP.. also please could you use the haptic engine api.. only app to vibrate like crazy... is annoying

1. I really wish it would notify you who if your contacts are online with an icon. I do understand you can see that if you click individually but a notification alert would be nice. 2. Visual status videos are limited to 30 seconds. System should allow full upload and automatically break so that video can lay instead of it being manual. If you retain manual upload of a larger video to the status, please put time count on the actual video.  3. Update so that messages over a designated time point either delete or auto archive (making this contact specific would be great as well).  4. Blocked contacts should be removed from the contact list and placed in a separate list. 5. Frequent contacts should have their own list. 6. Allow the option to slow speed on stories and video upload for 1.5mins. 
Debería ser más privado
Really love it
Whatsapp is great but it need it own passcode.  Like telegram
Works ok
Since updating the iOS 11.2, making video calls without a hitch is impossible. The mic not working while making video calls. No audio on my end and they can’t hear me. video calls were blurry and choppy.
This app makes communication so easy and economical almost anywhere. I really appreciate it!  Several glitches have recently been fixed as well. Thanks for that!  One persistent glitch that has not been effectively addressed is that no matter how I configure the notifications, whenever I receive a WhatsApp message now, it just pops up right in the center of my screen instead of at the top, as I had set it up to do. This gets in the way of anything I may be doing, like streaming a show, or using another app.  Interestingly, after the latest update, my messages started appearing as a banner at the top of the screen - as they once used to do - and they lingered there (as I also set them up to do) but out of the way. So I thought the problem had finally been fixed. However, after an hour or two, the WhatsApp messages I received went right back to popping up right in the center of my screen; obstructing everything.  PLEASE fix this issue once and for all because it’s been a while. Meanwhile, 4 ⭐️’s for a great program! 
I migrated my account to a different number. Many contacts lost connection with me because system did not update info. Thank you!
The ease of operating the app is wonderful
All I have to say is great app only thing missing is being able to see what others are listening too
User friendly, encrypted, great for business use👍
Don't open in my iPhone
تطبيق راائع
Thanks WhatsApp team and very nice app
CAN you guys make it possible to back up to google drive in iPhone (IOS) ??!! Thanks 
Copy pasting functions are unwieldy and slow,  and unfortunately the app gets blocked by certain countries. Issues aside, still a useful and very international messaging app and worth keeping.
I updated my WhatsApp the last time and it took it off of my phone and won't let me use. I'm pretty upset.
I would like the option to activate the two step verification code in a manner which the passcode would be required EVERY TIME I want to read my text messages in WHATAPP, and not just once in a while. That way hackers can’t easily read my texts at their leisure. They would need that verification code to do so.
The best app ever
WhatsApp is so far one of the best free text/video apps I have ever tried. I only wish that it is also as easy to add contacts without first sending them the invitation. I don’t know where the contact’s info goes to just by adding it without the invite because I don’t see it in the contacts list. Other than that, it’s awesome👍👌!!!
I love you ❤️ thanks 😘 gracias Por todo @WhatsApp🎶🥁🌻🥁❤️💁🏼🌸🌹🌸🌹🇺🇸🦋🚀🇧🇴👀👁🎶👁👀🌎🌎🌎🚀🦋🦋🦋
I never had an issue with this app!!
Por alguna razón no puedo grabar mensajes más de unos 10 segundos.
Such a good app to send messages to your family and friends ❤️❤️
I don’t understand why did they rate whats app # 12 now I can’t download it as my phone is restricted to download apps higher then #12. Whats app please put the rate down
ممتاز جدا جدا
I can’t open up the app because it disappeared. I tried to reinstall but nothing happens. Help!
It is a user/friendly apps
Video call won’t connect on 3g. I am in usa. To India where 3g or 4g or LTE is available. So leaving a feedback 1* just to get some attention.  Thank you, Lakshmi Prabhakar Koppolu 
i would rate 5 stars if we could change the chat bubble colors, but other than that it’s great! just like telegram, but whatsapp is better ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
It doesn’t show up when my phone is ringing and so I miss very important calls from family
👌🏼👌🏼
I’m giving them 5 starts bcuz this is the way I communicate with my family members in Mexico. We send instant msgs text and voice even make calls. For me that’s a 5 starts.

This is very awesome app to use for all kind of communication
Genios, adelante.
Thanks you helped me send the things I needed to sent stuff your better then just sending SMSs
Awesome
When I first got the app there was few issues now we find it very hard to hear and reconnects a lot during calls.
Sweet connection. never had a dropped call. It can’t get no much better than this
WHATSAPP DEBERIA CREAR WHATSAPP(live) por lo menos para los grupos creados . Sería buena idea.
The best messaging app!
It grows my business real good...5 Star Much Love
Really it’s good apps. I love this
This app has kept me connected with many of my fellow friends and family members world wide, runs off WiFi or if you have great phone reception the service works like a charm. This app has been a life saver because no per minute charges when I international calls;   The minor freezes hardly ever but WhatsApp takes really great care of promptly repairing the problem.   I’m very excited to see what’s next to come!  Thanks! 
The app works great. I love that you can make phone calls with it too.
Never fails me. All my love ones are using it. So easy.
1- Used to be able to make good quality phone calls via WhatsUp, but not anymore. Whats is reason(s)????. 2- WhatsUp never prompts the participants , to cite an example, with any good features/short-cuts via a message. Such things we hear about vis friends on WhatsUp groups 
Totally trash, the app crashes when i trying to forward something, besides if I’m listening to music and i open the app the music stops. You guys need to find a solution soon is possible. Thank You
Video call notification sound is very low after the update!!
Es una excelente app. Nos ayuda a estar en línea en todo momento!!!😉😉
It’s a great way for me to see all the photos and large videos so that I can see what my grandson is doing on his great adventure!
I have been using WhatsApp for a while. I love it but it would be a lot better and fun if whatsapp had the option on an iPad / laptop to video chat
Great app
I used WhatsApp to communicate with my family and friends all over the world I thinking it’s the best app eva! I deleted one day and I almost when into cardiac arrest!!
Es buena la app
I backed up my chat and through iCloud.  But when I re-installed the app it did not load the media files.
Falta mais privacidade
Great way to connect with friends and families all around the world!
Since the last update, the feature is missing which lets you go out of WhatsApp and you still can keep listening to the audio messages. Please fix this! Sometimes, I receive audio messages that are 5 minutes long or more and I don’t want to be forced to stay in the app the whole time when I could do something else ,while listening to the message.
This app is great for communicating messages and files,  I could send videos that other apps would fail on
Reception is crystal clear. Can spend hours talking with family in Europe and it’s free!
الأخطاء ما زالت موجودة
Suggested in groups when you publish video or link in the group, that is to prevent published again from any other member, so that you receive a message as "the publication of the same as the link or section by in this group"
Fix the issues of swiping notification
I absolutely LOVE WhatsApp! It’s very convenient and efficient! Keep up the good work!

Por cada mejora y cada ajuste de seguridad una estrella más.

This is one of the best app!
Makes a big difference with partners and associates at an entrepreneurial start-up phase to be able to use this tool - thank you !
This app is amazing my favorite social media app. And better than other apps you can make groups and I in one for my class and other things. Though I would like if you could find people just by searching for their nickname and not only by phone number. Overall it's really good download now.
Can’t play voice notes off the app with new update.
Very nice I enjoy it
Awesome 😊....in this busy, materialistic and practical world what’s app is the one and only user friendly app to keep all the family’s and friends together at one place....great 😊
Great app overseas.
Its an awesome app !!!!
It dosn’t work at all
Bluetooth in my car after times does not work. Not sure why all of the sudden it started not to work. I deleted app and installed it back and the problem continues. I’ve researched with out success to get it to work. I have an IPhone 6+
With my daughter’s traveling abroad this semester, this app has provided us with a free way to text and talk with her as often as we like.
Excellent app
Whatsapp is definitely the best app to talk to your friends abroad. No charges and no surprises. I am from Brazil. I use WhatsApp to talk to my family and friends abroad.  I love Whastapp!   Xoxo,   Ju C 
I really like the app because you can easily communicate with people in other countries. I like it.
I love this app. I stay connected with my family around the world. I would love for this app to have a security code be setup. Some apps in order to open it you must either enter a passcode or you can use your Touch ID to open the app. If you guys can figure this out it would be the best messenger app out there.
تطبيق عملي و بسيط و ممتع و رائع ومهم جداً في الحياة اليومية
This app has got to be the oldest if not one of the oldest message/phone calls/video calls apps that allows you to perform all above mentioned communication methods via WiFi.  A huge perk is that you may do this in both inside and outside your country cellular limits as long as you are connected to WiFi.  There is no unlimited usage in all forms of travel. It varies if you are on a cruise for example, or if you are on a specific travel package when you fly outside of the country- in which the responsibility lies between you and your service provider, not WhatsApp.  This is a fantastic app. Easy to use and straight to the point.  Thanks WhatsApp!!! 
Could NOT survive without this app- I do missions around the world and am in constant communication with people around the world
You're stealing a HUGE amount of screen space on iPhone 6 Plus, 7 Plus & 8 Plus!!!   Just take a look at the horrible space between the left side and the chat pictures, HUGE.   FIX THAT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, it's just horrible. 
I love it❤️
ع،ع،
Please fix the new update. I am unable to us my WhatsApp ever since this update. I Use WhatsApp to communicate with my dad and now I am unable to communicate with him because it keep saying that it needs to recovery my data but when its time to update it. It says it wasn’t able to. I have reinstalled many times and even restarted my phone and nothing changed.
With the latest iPhone update I can no longer click out of WhatsApp and hear the audios continue to play. It cuts them. This was a huge perk that everyone I knew as well as myself raved over as it allowed multi tasking while on phone. Another thing WhatsApp has never had and sorely lacks is that there is no option or ability (as there is on every other app and other messaging software or app such as Skype), to be offline or invisible. For those of us with many chats and many friends on WhatsApp there’s no ability to be invisible while on and anyone may say you and contact. Yes you can turn last seen off but you will still show as online when checking messages. This is my largest complaint about the app from a many year user.
Super easy to use, had zero problems!
It is very upsetting that WhatsApp decided to annoy all the users who don’t like notifications - by using a notification that comes up every time you open the app, telling you to ‘turn on notifications’. I am considering to uninstall it because of this!
👍👍👍
I think this app is great your allowed to customize the wallpaper and so many other things
مشكورين ع المجهود الرايع
WhatsApp will work on very little connectivity. When nothing else works, ft messenger email, WhatsApp will even be able to send and receive media and messages. It’s amazing.
Muy buena aplicación útil y necesario
My children live in Spain and without WhatsApp, we would literally cut off from each other. I am so grateful.
je dirais Bravo tout court
I can’t do or get calls from WhatsApp and I already had to delete my account and it didn’t work
Still perfecting its use but once I get this down ..... !!!! It will be awesome!
Can you give us face lock at least for paid version.
You Whatsapp team seriously need to add a dark mode for oled screen (in this case iphone x) in order to save battery because Whatsapp app is taking a lot of battery ,48% compared to youtube 20% it does not make sense whatsapp is taking too much battery for some reason and I don’t use it that much
it’s become worse than before i can’t download videos and pictures
Excellent app. Appreciated...
Whatsapp is the de facto messaging in many countries, and it has helped me so much to connect to my friends and family in Chile, Argentina and the US, calls are free and crystal clear, messages get through quickly and it integrates very well with the iPhone UI thanks to CallKit, so a call goes just like a traditional call.   For those that have android devices it’s a great way to stay in touch for free . 
Arriagas
Easy to use and navigate!
WhatsApp is really the best social media app it has everything is the best of the best nothing can’t say more than that
The update won’t allow you to play voicenotes while exiting out ap anymore 👎👎👎👎👎
good 4 seaman
So glad I have an outlet for privacy
i'm not using this app right now, but i'm sure it's great.
Hrrrrrr
I talk and talk and you can call or FaceTime people it’s an amazing app
We have family all over Europe and this app is not to beat!! However, when does it support the Apple Watch??
Merci beaucoup pour cette application
New version got a extremely poor quality when sending gifs... sometimes it’s impossible to understand the gif pic. Please fix it!
It is the best app crated on smart phone, it made our life easy and simple.
Need the following:  - Touch ID support (must-have feature)...  - send and receive "Apple Live Photos" without losing the format i.e., without flattening the photos at the time of sending...  - send more than 100 images at once...  - schedule messages to send at a later date....this will be very handy and make us more thoughtful and efficient.   - a feature that will let the senders to delete the sent images at the recipient's end... more like what Viber is offering now. That is a cool feature.  - send volatile messages and images i.e. images that will self-destruct after a few seconds. More like snapchat... that would be awesome...  -Need a feature that will delay sending the messages by 30 sec...more like Gmail.. That will make users more thoughtful and responsible in what they have to communicate...also, will give a second chance to frantic users to undo their messages from sending....this would be a great feature...  - an outbox like feature that would allow users to queue the messages, when sending multiple messages to multiple recipients at a given time. Right now, this is not possible in WhatsApp. This feature when incorporated will appeal to a lot of travelers and people on transit wanting to send messages with limited time and network connectivity.   - better calling features- improved call quality with better sound amplification.....also, the current voice mail feature from the last update is not that great..it is in fact silly if I may say. need a more straightforward approach  we are used to with a regular cell or landline phone....  - group calling feature...must-have feature...  - option to use multiple WhatsApp accounts (at least for two phone numbers) in one device... in that way, one can use WhatsApp for both personal and professional communications, mutually exclusively...

من اهم البرامج عندي
Really Best social program
What time is the bugs that you need to fix? You should describe what kind of bugs 
This is by far the best app ever. But please you guys should try to work more on the contact list. Sometimes I find it hard to search for names and then after seeing it the whole thing goes off. Meaning I have to start over again by searching for ‘M’
There needs to be an option go change the status thing to the normal contacts or something different I hate the new story like status and haven’t opened it ever since it launched its just adding more things that at least I personally don’t care about
Mi whatsapp se sale sólo ya lo instalé y desinstale en más de varias veces y eh reiniciado mi iphone 4 en más de varias veces ayuda
I could use more activity
❤️🙏🐶🐾ME ENCANTA USAR WHATS APP...
Essa nova atualização não permite mais ouvir áudios fora do aplicativo, ficou uma droga!
The new update is not working right with earphons I hope thatcan be taken care
I like this application because allows me to get in touch with my love ones the only thing I will suggest to improve will be on the video calls better quality and connection but other than that it’s nice
Since the last update, whenever I’m in a phone call on WhatsApp, it randomly ends the call! I don’t know how or why, but is there anything that can be done to stop this issue? Other than that, nothing bad to say about this app. I love it, and I’m able to talk to family members out in Brazil with WhatsApp.
Súper es muy manejable y muy useable además ayuda mucho gracias equipo de watts app
Muy buena
Very friendly n easy to use app, I haven’t tried the phone n video call yet but so far I love it.
Very bad
WhatsApp has disappeared from widgets session! 😡
My whattsapp keeps crashing 2 or 3 seconds after I open it. What can I do???!!!!
I love it.
Serves to connect people across the world continents! Congrats 💐
This app is definitely one of my favorites since I get to communicate with my friends all over the world & it’s free!
I understand that Whatsapp is now available on Apple Carplay but this version is still absent from the menu
i cant see all of the friends About
No more crashes on iPhone 7 iOS 11.2.5
Overall it is the smoothest chatting app. Though it'll be wonderful to have message reaction feature like Messenger! 😊
C’est un système qui nous facilite la vie sociale en nous communique plus facilement avec nos proches. Sincèrement ! 
Coooool
I love your app so much that i use it every day, but theres a problem, you don't have group calls which actually bugs me because in most of the texting apps they have group calls. So what are the plans for you? Will you do group calls or no group calls?
This communication platform has really minimize communication constraints and it is very fantastic communication medium which connects us to everyone in the world. The whole universe is now close with the aid of this platform. It Forster faster communication and downsize the cost of communication.

Hey guys, it seems like you screwed up something, cuz when somebody calls me when my headphones in - call goes to the speaker, unless you unplug them and plug them back. And as far as I know it is not only me who has this issue. Please fix.

Hi, please consider developing a faster playback for walkie talkie messages! Voxer offers 2x, 3x, and 4x but lacks stability and reliability of messages received/ proper notifications with incoming messages. Please add this feature! Auto play through back to back messages would also be amazing! Thank you for considering!
We have being trying call through what’s to Middle East specially UAE. However, it doesn’t work in UAE.
Harika bir şey bo uygulama bence çok güzel bir şey
I will love this to let us put a video as a profile pic
I have a problem with my WhatsApp when I’m receiving calls, when my iPhone (7 Plus) is lock most of the times I don’t hear when my phone rings or see when someone is calling, only time I notice is when I go into WhatsApp and I see a miss call from someone.   It would be nice if I can get my WhatsApp calls on my Apple Watch and editing what I would like to reply and say to people from the watch instead of just the standard ones which are there: hello, what’s up etc etc. 
Atualizei meu whatsapp e perdi ABSOLUTAMENTE todas as minhas conversas! um absurdo vocês
So far, it works great and simpler.
Al hacer una actualización de Gmail perdí varios contactos y además ahora para agregar a un contacto después de una llamada de Mi línea de teléfono con un contacto nuevo aveces se agrega al WhatsApp y aveces no ,
If you’re like me and don’t need to know every single update to a chat thread and want to set a custom alert so you’re not in a constant state of distraction from your work....  This App will SPAM you to change your alert settings every. Single. Time. You open the App.  If it wasn’t for work, I’d delete this app. Very disappointed. I mean this is 2018, shouldn’t we be able to dictate what content we control on our phones?!
UPDATE: 2/2/18 Well it was fixed and you could listen while in other apps again. Then last night iOS 11.2.5 came. You could still listen without app window open. This morning installed your "bug fix" update and break to not being able to listen with app closed. Why can't you guys get it straight?? 😡😡😡  1/9/18 You used to be able to keep listening to voice messages and open other apps, but with this latest update you can no longer do that. Please bring that feature back! Otherwise, great app!! 
I enjoy Working with WhatsApp
Very progressive at this in the history of having this app       Linda Edwards 
Wonderful
Fghug
Very good
I have been using this app for years to stay in touch with my family and friends that lives abroad. The group chat feature is the best you can have a chat with all your relatives it’s an excellent way to stay in touch
it does what it does.
You have to input a number instead of it telling you who else has the app. What idiot came up with that idea?
My phone whats app is update but there is no option name whats app web in setting so i cant active my pc whats app so its big bug
Goooooooood
So recently I found out that the latest version hasn't yet got the incognito mode switch on and off. If being offline doesn't show that Iam online then why not I can be offline but still send and receive messages. No status of last seen and no status of being online. So for example, my wife sends me a message expecting me to reply back then I open whatsapp and status shows that Iam online then I reply back to her then I close whatsapp but Iam still online for a couple of minutes then the bad news comes in, who are you talking to 😒 jealousy as everyone has it and will happen from time to time. So please work hard for us so we can live a simpler life. Thanks 
Automatic closing unable to use status
So far I haven’t had any problems with WhatsApp, messages going through ok and quite clear too when we speak , thank you
Use to be my favorite app but lately it’s not working correctly. I cannot access my contacts and the read check do not mark once text read. I emailed support and have heard nothing back yet. Not cool.
I’d like the app to stop showing badge notifications for muted groups!
I just received an apple watch series three tonight for my birthday, and was very excited to send a message from the watch but can not. Can someone please explain why this app doesn’t work with the apple watches?
My app keeps bugging out. When getting a call, I don't get notification that I'm getting a call. The phone just rings and vibrates. I have to know I'm getting a call and open the app myself. And then once I answer the call and the call connects, it still keeps ringing. You need to fix this
Should have an option where people cant see when you are online 🙄
This app is spectacular....and it’s free!!!!
Whenever i make video or voice call, another person is not able to hear my voice.
For the most part this app is really good. The call clarity is great, but sometimes it will just drop calls out of the blue and have the “beep beep” and it’s a bit frustrating when your in the middle of a conversation. But it’s a very good app to communicate with your loved ones over seas. But if you can’t afford to pay for the long distance charge you tolerate the beeping and just call back.
I was very happy with WhatsApp til I downloaded the new updated version which I was suggested to erase the old app and download the new app. By doing this I would also recover some the deleted stuff. To this point It hasn’t recover 90% plus of my records. 
Hi -Plz making user name like instagram and telegram -creating channel or page -profile picture like telegram not one picture  -message effects like imessage in ios -creating account with email instead of mobile number like instagram - 3 or 5 account means multi account like instagram 
I was trying to use what’s app but I don’t see any contacts that have merged. This app hasn’t been very useful to me.
One of the best apps ever designed.
WhatsApp call is not working at all
It’s my favorite messenger. It works so well also for sending photos, but the microphone button can be “slippery” and then your voice message is gone. This can be annoying.
The app is awesome, but I think you should redesign the app to a more modern one because its very simple and it looks very old to be honest! I think you guys should add more features and make thr app more modern
I m very agree to what’s app but sometimes some problem very disturb me
Me encanta
Worst app!
Great app for communicating with family and friends.
Is it possible to collapse notifications - maybe like iMessage or texts
Eased communication in the world. We next waiting for video conferencing
Hope you add apple watch support on whatsapp 🙏🏼🙏🏼

Last week WhatsApp crashed for unknown reason. Stoped. Restarted iPhone 6+ and that didn’t fix it. Had to delete WhatsApp and on restoration of previous conversations lost all thread after end June 2017: i.e. 7 months data obliterated!! No way to restore. WhatsApp ought to provide unlimited backup! Like google does.
I have noticed a major improvement in sound and latency when using WhatsApp live talk feature.  This has been true even when talking internationally.
Today when i was using Whatsapp ,suddenly the contacts disappeared and they are not shown, it’s awful and irritating.
مبارك سعيد السليطي
Good app..a must get!
Conversa por vídeo está quase boa!😉
Me encanta WhatsApp
Gracias
Thanks
Good
This is better a version of messenger
This app is really awesome. It is easy to use and the calls come in clear unless the other person has a bad connection but overall I’m really happy with this app.

Can’t hear
Needless to point the good size, who does\'t use whatsapp to connect with friends and family? What\'s missing huge time? Auto-delete media by chat! For iphone users like me, not being able to auto-delete media after a day or so the media was seen or auto-archive them to google photos, for instance, is the most annoying thing I have to manually do regularly in my phone. The only part taking advantage of this lack of functionality is Apple by selling more cloud subscriptions. People will eventually give up and subscribe to apple cloud for more space. PLEASE, enable the auto-delete/auto-archive configuration!! This is an inevitable upgrade to keep the app alive long-term. Even teenagers may start using the app when that happens! This is a win-win-win situation!!  2nd suggestion: Add a speaker versus iphone play button to listen to voice messages. 
Can you please fix this!
I stay in touch with my family in the Carribean and my friends who live overseas all through this great app.
Great product
I have iPhone 6 on iOS 11.2.5 Sometimes I reboot my iPhone because your app is lagging the iPhone... Not just when i stay on the app... even when i get a notification 
I cannot figure out why after redownloading I don’t have the shortcut on my screen
Love it, keep improving on the encryption and I will forever be grateful.
Please fix the calls problems thank you
I think the quality of the profile picture should be updated as well. U upload a high quality picture on your d.p and the quality reduced. That’s not a god thing and I think it should be upgraded. We expect a high quality profile picture
Thanks a lot. I waited 5 years before I did.
Great App
What a great app.  I am excited to communicate with my family who are on a cruise for 8 days while I’m in an emergency situation taking care of my father.  I feel like I am on the vacation with photos that I can view.  I am so happy I downloaded this app.    Couldn’t have this experience with out.  I may not be on the cruise but I sure love seeing everything !!!
ممتاز
I just got to chat with my best friend who is in South Africa for the next few weeks (I’m in Seattle). I’ve been sick and really missing her! Without WhatsApp, I wouldn’t be able to talk to her or even message her at all. It warmed my heart so much to hear her voice and it’s all thanks to WhatsApp! Thank you makers of this service, you are a God send!
I love the app and everything about it but I hate this new update where I can’t leave the app as I listen to voice note. I like being able to multitask, listen to voice notes as I do other things on my phone. Please put it back to how it used to be.
Whatsapp is heaven sent...very appreciative of this app...and functionality is perfect as always!!!!
Be very cautious as to personal data you share on this app. It’s not safe or private. Released to the public under Facebook.
Continues to prompt me to turn on notifications even though I don’t want them on.
I can’t send or receive calls or msgs when not connected to Wi-Fi. It doesn’t recognize my lte service. Other apps working fine.
Me gusta usar WhatsApp
Es una muy buena app
Casi todo lo q se necesita...
So I have friends that are over seas and this app is very reliable. I know everything I need to like when they are online, did my message get delivered and read etc etc. you can respond to specific messages if you want. Photos can get automatically saved to your phone if you wanted. It’s very enjoyable.
جداً جميل very good
I get to talk to my family and friends in other countries super amazing app!
Great app, gets the job done, especially when you’re out of the country.
why you not make email activation better than phone number activation
I would’ve given 5 stars if it wasn’t whenever you close the tab, it show that you won’t receive notifications. That has to go!.
This app allows me to communicate with a dear friend in Europe daily at no cost to either of us. Love this wonderful app!
Only one thing killing. Every time I post a video on my status longer then 30 seconds and select the second half, it’ll always be off sync. So disturbing. 👎🏻
Help please
Just please solve the problem about when close whatsapp we can’t get notifications, it wasn’t like this before !!
Me gusta es más individualista. Pero las llamadas se cortan al recibir otra llamada. Debería haber una señal qué hay otra llamada o mejor dicho un aviso nada más y no cortarla
Wish I could give it minus stars!!!!! The app never worked after I updated it..  It gives me a message saying that it\'s trying to \"Recover Chat History\" but it never does.. it reaches 8% then crashes!!!!! I\'m no longer able to open the app... 
I hate that I have to install a special app just to talk to people that can’t afford an iPhone. Anytime I get a WhatsApp alert, it literally makes me cringe. May be easier just to delete these people from my life, rather than be forced to use this atrocity.
علوش ابن السيد
Great App! Especially to keep in touch with love ones
Pls fix it so I can once again listen to my voice notes off the app!!!! Pls I work on Whatsaap and need that to be fixed
I love this app my son father got deported n he call him on this app as if he neve left
Great to keep up with friends
Nobody can live without it❤️
I wish if we can make log out from it like other apps it will be great thing👍🏻
1/28/18 review: the new update is so awesome WhatsApp refuses to run and instead sends me in an endless loop to the AppStore to reinstall the new update I just updated to.   Old review: While walking my dog WhatsApp out of the blue sent me a notification saying that my phone was not verified. After going through the verification process I suddenly receive 83 messages going back over a month.  No idea why this happen as I've had the same phone, iOS version, cell phone provider, etc. for a while. Not did WhatsApp tell my friends that I was not receiving messages.  I've had problems from day one with WhatsApp. Messages can come in slow, out of sequence, sometimes a server can't be found, etc.  it is also a massive power drain. The only usage for this is for contacting Apple hating android users. 
The linked in chat doesn\'t appears anymore ? What wrong?
Its a great app i been using it for years now .i just bought a galaxy s8 and most of the time am using bluetooth headset,the problem is,it does not notify me of whatsapp incoming calls nor it does allow me to answer the call on bluetooth headset.
Just updated and when I receive a video call with my earphones, it answers in speaker. Pls fix urgently! It’s very annoying..
Me gusta mucho esta aplicación, es muy genial 👍🏾
This app used to be so good but last one years its getting worst and worst everyday  Cant make video call or call just msg  So my all freinds calling me on imo or facetime so for that 👎👎👎👎 
Line is idea staticky or call dropped
I can message absurd messages to my friends and then delete them.
I have updated whatsapp several times on my iPhone 5 but I can't get the new whatsapp emojis. Any help please
you should block all people who use whatsapp gold and any other program it’s very annoying i hate whatsapp for that please contact me if you solve it thank you 😊
very good
Awesome app!  Love the ability to group chat with 250+!
It’s made like a puzzle you have to spend hours trying to figure out how to send a message or call someone new. VS just having a compose button or something
👍👍👍👍good

شكرا
Ever since I upgrade from my iPhone 7 Plus to my iPhone X I couldn’t be able to do a WhatsApp calling and when attempt to do one my iPhone freezes completely and it doesn’t response till WhatsApp drops an “Call failed” in the Mac centers you keep telling me it’s the application “they have restore and reset my iPhone X,  3 tines now and I have still have the same problem !!! Need a solution !!
Very good
I am sometimes using the app but it is a good app but it is a good app but it is does it better but it has to do a good job 👏 it in the real world 🌍 and it in a person can you send it over the phone 📲 is that the girl is a little more and you have no more time in you to be happy and she gets a little more nervous 😬 next time you’re tnot you think try 💭 is it to me I know that she will have it but she will never ever be so I can tell she has you do made me sad so I 😔 I am so sad that I was have you come back I just didn’t want her
I can’t instal WhatsApp in my new iPhone X. I don’t receive The verification number. I wrote to the service in order to be helped but no answer...

Estoy muy satisfecha con WhatsApp 👍🏻👍🏻
It’s cool that you can talk to ppl that are wayyy out of the country or other places. I love this a lot I like it better than messaging 🤷🏽‍♀️ . I use this app more !! Thanks 4 showing me this app rolling sky 💋 .
Best app ever ❤️
Notification at times go silent which is bad. If they fix that and add support settings to choose video quality for video quality other than auto select, it will be great
Whatsapp would’ve gotten a 5 if it supported group/conference call....is there a reason it doesn’t?     Thank You!!! 
The person I wanted to use this with when I went to my contacts the person was not there for me to be able to texy
Our family group could not function without this app! It is amazing!
Great app to video calling,Texting..& Voice call without any kind of network problem..video & audio quality is very strong..i have been using this app..since 2015..TNx a lot for the new update..I really really appreciated..hope next update will be more useful than now..❤️💙💙❤️💙😊😊😊
Thank you for your service and letting us connect with loved ones over seas for free💕🌺
Ne moze bez interneta govno!
I down loaded it like 4-5 times it won’t show up on so I can press agree terms and continue

Me and my best friend could never even FaceTime. She told me about this app, and I was skeptical. I didn’t believe it. I still got the app, and I was pleasantly surprised. What can WhatsApp do better than Messages? You can FaceTime with people you can only message or voice call with Messages. Messages? What Messages? WhatsApp is taking over the world, one text at a time.
Es mejor que Messenger
Only thing missing is conference calls. That may not fit with the encryption structure, but as a naive user, it is definitely a drawback. Maybe multiple simultaneous pair wise encryptions? (And while you’re at it, how about 7 mutually orthogonal red lines in green and transparent ink?)
I will use it alway
When you try to minimize the video (PIP) to the right side the video just vanishes and we cannot get it back. Cannot even disconnect from our side. Please fix this.
Whatsapp isn’t sending me notifications, all notifications are on from the settings but I’m not receiving any notifications
Wish I could add GIF’s
So, it would be great if, when we send a photo, the whole photo shows up in the thread, so people in the group don’t have to tap on it to see the full picture.
Why i should keep my whatsapp open to receive messages its a very stupid thing as will why i have to keep my phone connecting while i’m using it on pc ??? The last update was really annoying ...

Great App for communication it work for me and my family
The only thing I miss, the ability to restore chats from Google Drive; I migrated from Android to iOS. I don’t mind at all.
Really nice app
My son is moving to England for business. This app has been a great help in communicating quickly across different medium. Highly recommend.
This is one of two apps that provide an additional level of security that Facebook, KIK and others don’t! Easy to use but hard to get rid of people you no longer want to talk to.
I love this app
Muy bueno
👍🏼
This is amazing ✨
Hello I hope someday admins in groups can delete chats remember in group 😑  And only admins can sending in groups 😐 
I love the app easy to manage send pics vids, but only giving 3 stars because no Apple Watch support this is essential for the way my life is. Other than that best app.
This app is awesome and helps me communicate with my daughter who is studying abroad in Europe.  We can text, video call or just talk.
Hi nice app
Love this app
It’s a good app, but it’s limited in features.  Unless I missed something, there  no way to use your local phone to fail out.  It would be nice to be notified on  individual numbers.  Other than that it’s okay.
Is it possible that the next time you guys update the app you put in some new and exciting features like new “chat wallpapers”? Because I know those old chat wallpapers have been there for like... ever. Please introduce some new chat wallpapers.
So I’m in the army and currently deployed over seas. I don’t have calling and I can only text other iPhones. I tried getting WhatsApp but the problem is that they have to CALL/MESSAGE you a code to confirm your number. Obviously you get the app to do such things, because you can’t receive a call or message.   WhatsApp...Serving soldiers that may die far from home. 
The best ap ever ❤️
WhatsApp is the best thing to happen to smartphones. I just wish we could send gifs direct from the app like on iMessage. 🙁
Buenos
Very useful
It has been a fantastic, convenient and quick link to a contemporary communication passion.
I LOVE everything about this app, but there seems to be a minor glitch that shows the audio messages length incorrectly. Other than this, the app works great! :)
Me encanta
Thank you guys now I have my family on my contacts
Cuts cost of communication and Provides good and reliable service
- No self-destruct messages. - Can't save more than 5 photos/videos at once to Camera Roll. - Can't disable group/voice read receipts. - App freezes/stutters while downloading lots of media, even on latest devices. - Video being played is interrupted once a background download finishes. VERY ANNOYING!! - Even after clearing up all chats, app still keeps lots of undeletable stuck data. - Can't clear all media and keep only text chats (no granular "clear chat"). - No iPad / Apple Watch / iMessage support. - Can't backup only text to iCloud (no granular backup). - Archived conversation confusing implementation (unarchives after receiving a message). While on vacations I wish I could hide work groups. - No background send from other apps (have to wait for the progress bar to complete). - Confusing "all starred chats" UI inside settings: make it like a regular group so we can have all the group features (mass share/save/select-all, etc). - No option to demote admins if you are the group creator. - Messages that failed to be downloaded have to be redownloaded one by one (Whatsapp should automatically retry downloading all failed messages until they are completely downloaded). - Non-admins can change group icon/name - make it a group option. - Web interface and Desktop app depends on phone connection/battery to work (no direct access to Whatsapp's servers). - While viewing all media, can't filter for video/photo/audio. - Can't make regular calls from Whatsapp itself. - No drafts like Telegram. - No music / video PIP player, only for Youtube links. - No native Live Photos support (stupidly converts it to a gif instead). - Clumsy and slow camera UI that crops your photo and takes no Live Photos. - Can't filter data usage by cellular/wifi. - UI for sending live photos as gif/vid and UI for filters are very hidden! 
. . .but setting up and using the app is not an intuitive process.
Love
Please can whatsapp admin please add video calling on ios 7.1
I can keep in touch with my son in Germany without incurring huge International data fees!
I would like to say this is an excellent app. When we do a FaceTime chat it goes very well. When we’re texting it’s immediate. I can send photos easily and receive them just as easily. It saves my chat which I like. It’s a great app for chatting with your friends or family who are overseas and it would be too costly to text and chat via cell phone on a regular cell phone plan here in the states!!
J j j
The interface is intuitive and uncluttered. Performs well.  Can't switch between audio calls & video calls on the fly like similar apps like Google Hangouts and Skype.  Recommend. 
Among all Messaging Apps, WhatsApp is amazing for its tailoring security features as well as easiness of use. Another great thing, no buggy ads here... On behalf of billions of WhatsApp users, I sincerely thank to the WhatsApp Authority for giving us the opportunity to connected with our Friends and Family who are living in distant locations.
The new youtube feature is awesome  Keep the good work 👍 
☠️💥
Whatup’s has revised the connectivity.
Freeeeeeeee And just like SMS it’s immediate  Thank you for this amazing and FREE app 
Bad network and too many notifications specially when I need to leave a chat group.
For the past few years I’ve been using WhatsApp within my colleagues all over the world. I always reach the love to speak amongst us for free. WhatsApp has been such an open door opportunity to all my friends; I overly rated at 99.9/100. I have never seen a net work which can save human nature in their financial services like such. An the others hands, God bless the CEO’s whom came up with this idee, and the entire staff of this company. God bless you guys again to the bottom of my heart and my family. With that said, you have made me and my friends, families life so easier to reach anyone’s abroad. Not only I can not live without it; without WhatsApp, I’ll missed 25% of my contacts. No one on earth can really have more consideration than me when we’re talking about WhatsApp. I wish that I can become a partner with the company. This is my truly opinion, I don’t know about you.

إنه الأكثر شيوعاً والغني عن التعريف حتماً بلا منازع
This app i like alot because you can text you parents or your family for pther states and i can call and video chat
After iOS 11.2.5 update, my 3D Touch randomly does not work in Whatsapp until I close and restart the app. iPhone 6S Plus iOS 11.2.5
I have used What’s app for years. But it’s not letting me call out or my friends call in!!! Can you fix it..? Got an iPhone X. Worked good before that.
While vacationing in Spain it was the tool of choice for our AirBnB host. It worked great.
Hacer un buen uso de los medios de comunicación es la responsabilidad de todos. WhatsApp es un medio comunicación confiable de estos tiempos. El grupo los Amados que se formó hace 3 años ha sido de mucha bendición, tanto a los 31 miembros del grupo , como también a las comunidades que hemos impactado con nuestros servicios de Capellania a las vidas sin techo; todas las actividades las coordinamos dentro del chat del grupo!!! Además Cada día nos levantamos con una Palabra de aliento y esperanza, que los miembros del grupo envían cada día para el alimento espiritual de todos!! Hacemos reír con bromas sanas, también el compartir de nuestras actividades familiares y las felicitaciones de los cumpleaños de cada miembro nos hacen sentir amados y queridos, unos por los otros. WhatsApp nos ha sido un instrumento de evangelización de excelencia. Gracias le damos a Dios por este medio!!   El Ministerio Los Amados se siente bendecido y sin duda, por los pasados 3 años WhatsApp ha sido la casa de los 31 miembros del grupo. QDLBM!!!🙏 
I didn’t know about this app until my professor suggested this app to use as a form of communication with students regarding school work. I use it also for personal chats with family and friends!
افف
I love this app and I use it every day
مافي اشعرات
This is a great app to use.
Thank you for your service
Annoying.
Reliable and Trustworthy! I use it to keep in touch with someone overseas and I don’t have to pay to talk or text them.  The regular call function doesn’t always work properly, but when it doesn’t, we just use video chat.  Been pleased with it. 
En mi estado de WhatsApp
I have had this app for about a year and it has been great! It has helped me keep in touch with my family and friends with no payment at all. WhatsApp is a great app and you should get it.(to the creators) I hope that there will be an update where you can use animations emojis like on the iPhone X that would be amazing!!! 
I so like WhatsApp,WhatsApp I love you!!!😍😍😘😘😎
Won’t even assist me to help me fix this app. I’m deployed and they won’t even help.
Eres súper espectacular
Hardly connect
It keeps shutting down whenever I open the app, doesn't show all the msgs that I receive
Good to connect and keep I touch with ur friends in ur contacts buh i have just one disapproval with whatsapp albeit it will be included in later updates though... the inability to download others status is a huge con on whatsapp side
Amazing app that I can keep in touch with everyone around the word
I love the app, can you pleaaase pleaaase pleeeaase put a “BLOCKED SINCE....(mm/dd/yy)” part for every user in the blocked section? I’d really appreciate it!
I am  suggesting you to add a new feature whatsapp live it must be more nice and awesome
The best !! Awesome!!!!!!!!
I loose all of my chats since the virsion 2.18 is released!  Unfortunately I cant delete it and reinstalled cuz i will be not able to restore my chats Its so important to me could you please fix it?  I cant open my what's app 12 days now :(( 
I wanted to know why I cannot video chat or make calls out of country?
El tiempo d mensaje de audio es muy corto ya q en el otro celular q tenía la aplicación tenía más duración y ahora q instale la aplicación en este nuevo celular la grabación d mensaje d audio es muy corto  Xq me pueden indicar xq el error o si es q necesita una nueva actualización 
Really the WhatsApp is Deserve 5 stars.  respect for you. 
Love the new emoji update keep on WhatsApp team
It’s a good app when it actually works. I downloaded this app as well as my whole family to keep in contact with my husband while he is on deployment and well it worked all of two days and then I remembered why I deleted it in the first place a couple years ago.
Phone calls have improved but still room to get better
When i updates my iphoe .. all of sudden my whats app hang ..  Please can u rectify this problem.. I dont want to loose the previous data..  And one more things new updates when i m chatting someday on whats app.If anybody is sending msg to me its reflectiong on screen until we read it cannot process to chat others..

Yowhandy 1975
This is the best app ever. I love it. The only thing that I would like to have is passcode on chat. Sometimes someone else use my phone and because od privacy I would like to have option to lock some conversation. This app is great...
iPhone x 11.2.5 whatsapp app freezing
Best app ever if you have relatives outside of the US
It’s great it’s does everything I needed to do
Very satisfied, but sometimes when someone sends a message to me, it might take over an hour to receive it if I don’t actively use WhatsApp
It’s a great app with good privacy and I like how you can change the chat background (maybe changing the color of the bubbles would be cool too?) but there’s one problem: this stupid notification that keeps popping up! It says something along the lines of “if you close WhatsApp you might not be able to receive messages” I understand that I don’t care if I did I would have done something the first time not the 30th time! It’s also very deceptive as I think I’m getting an actual message. Please get rid of this it’s not helping anyone the 50th time it pops up.  Edit: yes that notification is still there and the weird part is I get my notifications just fine! 
I just started using WhatsApp yesterday and so far so good! Works like my other chat apps so far and pretty user friendly and easy to navigate. My one request would be if in a future version, you could allow us to select a custom background for each contact, like how we are able to in WeChat? I am usually chatting with multiple people at once, bouncing back and forth between chats. The custom background is very helpful for me to see who I’m chatting with instantly at a glance! This way I can avoid ooops situations of chatting the wrong person which has happened to me numerous times since I’m chatting multiple people all at once. Otherwise so far this app is good 👍 Thanks!
... the scheduling of the sending of a message is a feature I miss a lot!!!  Would it be possible to add it?  Also, can we invite people to use WhatsApp by sending them a txt message from the WhatsApp app? 
Keeps saying call failed!
Very good
I just started,,, im loving it
Definitely helps reduce ur bills
اتتتتتتتتتتتتتتتتتتتتتتااااااااااااالل
I have the iPhone X and I opened my WhatsApp today and it looks weird! It has two thick indentations on the sides that makes the text look smaller and it doesn’t occupy the those screen like it should. Please fix it immediately!
It is now very useful and favourite!!
The best app ever👍
I’d be willing to pay for an Iwatch option. They do create updates often, but keep skipping the Iwatch.
It has a lot of problems with freezing up constantly and cutting off. But I like to talk to my mom but sometimes a get frustrated with it.
What ‘s app is the best way to keep in touch with family and friends. Video calling is at it’s best. Thank you for keeping it free and accessible for people all over the world.
I love WhatsApp
WhatsApp just connect us all, around the world. That’s priceless. Thanks.
Love it
I love it
La actualizacion que hicieron no funciona me llegan mensajes con rayas en medio no sirve
Its the best app ever  Thank you for all your effort 
Call Quality is poor
Reasons i love this app are:   1. Its free 2. No ads 3. Not country specific. Works everywhere  4. Does not consume too much data except for when viewing friends status updates 
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Please make it compatible with iPod Touches.
نتمنى اضافات ميزات جميله اكثر واكثر ميزة القفل مثلاا وشكراا
Best ever. Would be lost without it!
ok so you guys can add a report button... because i get a lot of spam forwarded messages from my friends which i dont want to have in future.. so add an option where i can get rid of these spam messages
How do I delete this completely off my phone
This is one of the most tremendous and enjoyable social media apps I ever experienced! So thank you so much ‘WhatsApp’. Keep up the good work!
I like this app so much because it supports iOS 11.
This is a great app!!
عندما يكون الهاتف في وضع الخمول لاتصل الرسائل  ولا المكالمات الا في حالة فتح التطبيق حينها تصل الرسائل والمكالمات دفعة واحدة. 
Awesome way of communicating to family and friends when traveling internationally.  I love it!  Thanks for the app!!
Notification on iPhone 8 is not run well or fast enough
To WhatsApp technicians: fix it please!!
No me escuchan con las video llamadas y las notas de vos enviadas tienen ruidos 😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤯😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤯🤬🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬
I use WhatsApp everyday but I am a little disappointed as you don’t provide an Apple Watch app. The experience I get using a WhatsApp app on Apple watch would be more greater. Please make an Apple watch app. Thank you
Love this apps 😍😍
Me encanta 👍
Please try and separate group chart from individual chart
WhatsApp should add play all feature for voice messages the same feature in  iMessage so it would be easier to whatsApp lovers to listen to a lot of voice messages at one click
Good job
It crashes when I take long choosing status pictures or choose more than one. Or take longer than 20 secs to choose. Why?
Messaging is working. OK.  Sound messages volume is too low.  Recorded video volume is too low.   iphone 8. 
It’s true next month what’s up app pay for app charges
Love the app but i thought i could use it on my apple watch ☹️
Excellent
Por qué hay tantas actualizaciones del whatsapp? Y después no se actualiza nada
Ok
Esto del Estado , considero que no tiene justificación que exista. Lo que está pésimo es que no hay acceso a "todos" los contactos, solo aparecen a los que uno les escribe habitualmente y los demás ???!!!! 
Please fix the call waiting notification beep.It doesn’t beep when you receive cellular calls.
Cool, dope, hot, awesome, nice, butter or whatever you call it.
Great app, saves you a lot of money with texting and calling actually a 10 star app.
WHY is the app's UI is Soo slow?? Please make the app and responses to user's touch snappier
I LOVE IT. Especially when I want to send a video or a lecture it’s great.(Not able to send is what apps states, but not WhatsApp). I give it 5 stars and have referred friends and family. But most of my friends already had it so didn’t have to refer that many.
I really like whats app mostly i can talk to the friends that i want
Excellent app
Ggg
We need dark mode on iPhone X. Thanks
Great App But you know when one can remove the time of last seen for everyone like you don’t want people you work to stalk you  but family and friends should see last seen. They should have an option to customize only certain people can see last seen part. I’m sure this will come up soon. 
How do I retrieve chats from the cloud all my chats are backed up
Así como se pueden mandar algunos GIF, me encantaría que sirvieran los GIF como fondo de chat o para la foto principal.
Easy to use
New user. Simple and works beautifully.

يتم اغلاق الواتس فجأة بدون سابق انذار ومن ثم حذف المحادثات التي لم يتم نسخها احتياطياً.. ارجو تعالج هذه المشكلة
Well first I use this app constantly and enjoy being able to see if my family and friends have received and read my messages.  Sending photos and videos is great! And creating group chats with multiple recipients perfect when organizing something with others! No issues about needing WiFi to use the App.  Making calls a plus also if traveling abroad. 
Great app
I will give 5 stars but there’s is a problem that need to be fix soon!!! they need to fix the operating system process so we can make phone calls and video chat again since I have the I phone X I can’t use what’s up to make calls !!!! if someone please work on this I will really appreciated. Thank you. Other then that issue I love this app is my favorite so far it works fast and easy.
Perfect app to communicate with friends and family abroad without data usage. Easy to use. Automatically connects with contacts using the app. 👍🏽
The calls are not very clear. They constantly are breaking up making it hard to understand the other person.
Connection isn't the best
This app is so awesome it is so much better than texting
When i try to call someone or video call someone my cellphone (iphone X) gets freeze for a moment and then the app gets close alone, that always happen to me.
This app allowed me to keep in touch with my daughter who studied abroad for free. We did not have to use her phone minutes or text data to communicate. We could text, call, and face time freely. I love this app!
Thank you for supporting iOS 7.
Strength of Whatsapp is the ability to maintain the  Privacy while still able to share at mutiple levels like Family, friends....
Please please please
DEPORT.
Muy bueno
Updating this review after they fixed a bug that was causing it to constantly crash.
Saludos cortésmente me dirijo hacia ustedes con el fin de saber por qué no puedo utilizar la nueva función de ver vídeos en YouTube sin salir de whatsap ya que cuento con la ultima actualización del mercado espero su respuesta y mi teléfono es un iPhone por favor espero su respuesta
I would be VERY HAPPY if you guys deleted all of the wallpapers and put new ones. Thats all I ask for 🙏🏻.
I enjoy it a lot! But keep making it easy as it goes. Too much data costs
Best application
Great
Me and all my bffs have this app and we ❤️it!!!!! Pls buy it is amaze! 😛
I haven’t had any issues with WhatsApp in a very long time (impressive for any iPhone app I think), but this latest update has been causing some significant lagging during use. Especially with typing/keyboard oriented actions.  I have a brand new iPhone X, so I highly doubt its a performance issue by the device. Everything else works just fine. Thought it was just me at first but others around me (also with iphone 8 or X) said it happens to them as well, so I assume its just an update related issue. It doesn’t make it impossible to use, just a bit of a nuisance. Would appreciate a quick fix from the devs. 
I like the app, easy to use, very functional, and a convenient way to speak to anyone anywhere around the world.  There needs to be more options though, a like option for texts sent and received would be great, a more updated interface to make the app more appealing to challenge other messaging apps.  Other than that good app!
I haven't used Whatsapp in about 4yrs until very recently. I must say I'm impressed with the small and subtle changes that are of certain for the most good!!! Very fast working applications across the board!!! Hence, I gave a 5-Srars to!!! 👍🏾🤣🤘🏾
WhatsApp is amazing app I can recommend to everyone to use. It’s better and better compare to others. Thanks
Continuous lagging on iPhone 6s since last update
A messaging app of this magnitude that has no ability to export data and move it between phones of different types shows blatant disrespect of WhatsApp to their user base. The internet is riddled with crappy, wrong and quick buck solutions, profiting over frustrated users, for years, yet no solution exists or promised by WhatsApp. Shame on you.
I wish it had the option of deleting or, editing the message, the 7 minute deleting policy is not enough especially with leaving a footstep behind in the chat
Harıka
I love it♥️
You can chat with your family and friends at a low rate data plan.
What is wrong with the latest update on iPhone X??
Could only hear every 3-4 seconds. Calling from Columbia to US.
Something needs to be done about the child porn in the groups. I attempted to report it, and the process was pretty difficult.
Fantastico
I can see the icon in my apple phone after update
Good good
Very slow on iPhone 6
Why on apple can I not use my own custom ringtones though??? I could give a full 5 star if this were an option.  Otherwise great product and very helpful while I’m in Korea!
الشكرلله
For the most part it works well
Man if y'all don't quit playing and add memes/GIFs for iPhones already 😒
Whatsapp just full of bugs. App doesn’t work well. Poor
Why does WhatsApp doesn't recognize that my phone is on DND? I'm trying to ignore from calling me but I don't want to block them so I put my phone on DND and it keeps sending notification and vibrating that I'm getting a call like come on whatsapp fïx this.
Most reliable messaging app. Simple and relatively stable.
easy, free, beautiful
Por favor modifique los emoji y pongan la opción de poner el pelo rojo.
What’s happening??? Why whatsapp is becoming more slower, please fix
ഞൻ 3 കൊല്ലത്തിന് മുകളിൽ ഉപയോഗിക്കുന്ന ആപ്പ് ആണ് പിന്നെ വോയിസ് കോളും വീഡിയോ കോളും ഫ്രീ ആണ് ഇതിൽ
When it will work with Apple iWatch???
I really hope you do fix this because it means a lot to me  On android devices you can send each other up to 10 minutes of video time and on IOS Devices all you can send is a minute and a half ffs just fix this the app is great and all but i find this a problem 
Great way to stay in touch when traveling so as not to incur expensive roaming charges.
The easiest way to keep in touch with family and friends in the while world
Would be great if you could send invites, and people would confirm
Bug in the Status section of the two-party video
Chihuahua
I enjoyed what’s up!
Excellent *****
I find WhatsApp very convenient to keep in touch with my overseas family and friends. It’s also very convenient when I’m overseas myself. And being free makes it the best App.
There’s still a number of user interface glitches. There’s also no Apple Watch app for WhatsApp.
Excellent way to communicate with our grandson while at college in the UK
Hey so congratulations on the best messaging app ever made. My one small annoyance is this. When something goes over the front camera while I am listening to a message it quits playing it through the speaker which I find very annoying because it does it all the time like when I have it on my desk sitting in a have to move my arm over it.
please make so photos and videos can be seen without having to be added to your gallery, thank you.
Mi teléfono tiene una nueva versión y whatsapp no funciona con esta versión por favor actualiza
We use this as a group chat. We have people in Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio and the Dominican Republic. Is works awesome.
Lets me communicate with my mother while shes away!
Videos is very glitchy but more so it’s saying I have messages unread when I do not. Please fix!
Just updated to the newest version and it’s still not working on WiFi.  I’m connected to the same network as the NVR and it still doesn’t work. I contacted their technical support yesterday, been more than 24 hours and so far no answer. 
There when we need it mostly for Mexico
What’s app is the beeeeeest!!!!
You have to give a chance for us to download status videos of our contact and allow to use video at profile photos side
Vm
Good
New lock-in feature for voice messages is great!
m̾
My favorite way to communicate in the states and abroad. Very user friendly, nice functionalities and super reliable.
It’s impossible to figure out how to send a message to somebody new who hasn’t yet sent me a message
dear friend  When i open the application it closes quickly. There's a problem I have because it is not open to me I got this problem after i upgraded the application i hope to fix this problem 
I have  iphone x and I cant use voice call!!
The app works really slow
Whatsapp needs to a new update. They should allow iphone users to customize their notification sounds. Thank you.
Hello you should make adding friends a little easier than what it is now.
The program is very useful that I never used it
That ^ give me some Star Trek technology here
- only one device at the time - almost no privacy choices - on iPhone where no way to hide your status - limited file transfer capabilities - it force us to update it, even if we don't want  Telegram is way better. It has none of those issues and all the well functional features. It also suggest cool Stickers (that we pre-download for free) when we chose any emoji. 
You’re go bro
ي ليت لو بس تخفون الظهور هذي ملاحظتي بس
This is a grate app you could FaceTime you quick text and you don’t have to go on FaceTime or messenger it’s just greatThank you for making this up you are a great great great app thank you
I love the WhatsApp because it keeps me communicating with family and friends. Thank you WhatsApp for trying your best to keep everyone together and chatting
The best application to stay in touch with friends and family members. Its quick and easy to use.
Thank u for this rich application that helped us around the world to keep touch on our families and friends are far from us , I just wanted to know if there's any possibility to make live in WhatsApp and comments and likes etc ... like social medias , It's would be great from u and for us too Thank u for your efforts to make us connected to our dears and I hope you all the best 
Super helpful app
Great connection and I love this app.
The app works great but all of the updates & upgrades require you to relaunch each time before you get any messages & all.  Sadly it’s the only app of its kind that does this!! Please hire someone to teach how not to constantly need this!!
The messages aren’t being delivered to the person for minutes on end and it gets frustrating
Nice app. Works. The UI needs a little refresh and perhaps some cleaning as well. The new Skype looks nicer in comparison. Hope the WhatsApp team can take some notes from it.
I love whatsapp-don’t we all. But it would be SO much better if we could leave VM’s. Please and thank you
What a nice App it is . Easy to use and very useful. Thanks so much.
It’s great been using it for couple years on all my travels
Before the update, whatsapp seems to be able to handle all of my contacts' last seen very able as in I'm able to know exactly when they were last online on Whatsapp. Now, even if my friends have replied to my messages, their last seen aren't updated. For example, my friend sent me a text at 17:53, their last seen was at 09:12. This just doesn't happen with one of my contacts, it happens to a lot of them. Please fix this!
We need an apple watch app!!!!  The notifications are not working 
O verdadeiro app moderno. Teria q vir pré instalado.
This is the best app I have ever used to communicate with people from all over the world! It works great and I get good quality. It keeps my pics and videos private. I love this app
Great app! Used to communicate with my people in Vietnam!
I wish I can edit my sent messages to correct spelling mistakes, if you have this option please let me know how to. Thank you 
And losing my typed but not yet sent messages
I really enjoy using the app! But for some reason I can’t listen to certain voice messages that people sent me...
I hate WhatsApp bc it didn’t let me see pictures or the voice messages so I rate it one star
Una conección muy buena para llamadas. Excelente para enviar imagenes y videos. 
I love this app! Its so easy to call my family that lives far away from me FOR FREE! I love it!
How can I delete sent messages
المتخلفين العرب ما ينفع لهم هذا التطبيق عشان صورة رمزية سببو لي مشكلة  معفنين 
Thanx so much
Very useful
Es super lento en iOS 11. Si no iOS 10.3.3 funcionaba excelente. Muy mal.
Amazing app lets u talk to people worldwide and the phone calls and video chats are amazing quality too 🤣👍😊🙉
With WhatsApp I can absolutely call my family and friends anytime anywhere with an Internet connection
Just add in a way to customise chat bubble colours.
Gracias por permitirme estar conectada con mi familia a la distancia, USA y Nicaragua
Make it easier to listen to music in whatsapp, please. Wish it wouldn’t stop playing when i close a chat. 😢 
تف
Escuchaba hablar pero no le preste atención, desde que la usé, hace más de 5 años no hay un día que no la use.
Can not reduce or increase with volume buttons. Specially on speakerphone. Once adjust volume have to turn off and on speakerphone again.
Good to have if you dont have any line on your phone...my kids are enjoying it more they call and text me everyday every minutes hahaha.  Thank you whatsapp!
Tengo otras aplicaciones pero esta esta para mi al 💯% 24/7/365=💯😍💕.........

End to end encryption is a fantastic feature. Something the world needs.   One thing I would say could use improvement is the hyperlink previews. iOS Messages does a better job in my option. 
This app is awesome I could do everything in it thanks for this app called WhatsApp
Nothing intuitive. Nothing user friendly. Unfortunately, I’m moving to an area where this is the app used for most communication. And I dread it with everything in me. I’d rather have surgery than use this app. No clear tutorial, nothing explained, just a poor design.
Whatsapp has a good feature and reviews as one of the chat apps. And I find it totally useful, even the quality of the Whatsapp Call is getting better, keep it up please. Thank you
Can’t hear. The audio goes in and out
love i.t
I talk to my friends all over the world for free. It's an perfect app!
telegram has more option, wts seem apps since made it
WhatsApp  is very good it’s good because I can connect with my family without paying a dime which is very awesome and I can FaceTime the people that don’t have any iPhone.
Good job with UI
Best way to communicate across the globe for free and it will keep your conversations private.
It’s truly been an awesome experience speaking to friends and family from all over the world thank you WhatsApp
Wonderful app!
Works much fast then iMessage and much easier to text since I got WhatsApp if I text on any other app I hate it
잘쓰고잇네융
Thanks for keep the iOS 7 support!! I appreciate!
This app is getting on my nerves.i am trying to speak to my friend and it ends the call for no reason. Please fix this 😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬
WhatsApp is a great app you can tell when people are in and when hey read your text! No more mysteries! 😝 I love WhatsApp!
rezapourrahim
What's app is so easy to communicate with friends and family so I love it much !
My only concern is when I upgrade my iPhone to new iPhone X i thought that I will get the same WhatsApp data but later I come to know that this is the data for the last update and I lost all my videos if there is away to backup all WhatsApp data when I  synchronized the phone with iTunes we can overcome this issue. Thanks for giving me the chance to sort my concern 😊
It is a wonderful app,? I can’t imagine myself living without it.
I can’t pass one ☝️ day without WhatsApp cuz it the only best friend that I have and thanks to people who was invented it
Great
Keyboard:   WhatsApp on iPhone X doesn’t (sometimes) show the very last message in a conversation because the keyboard hides it. I have to hide the keyboard (by swiping it down) to see the message. This only happens with whatsapp and no other messaging app. Fix that please.   Swiping to close whatsapp can bla bla bla:   Please remove that notification. I keep closing the app and I NEVER missed a notification. I keep on getting this annoying notification (sometimes) when wiping up to close the app. Just remove it, it’s annoying and useless...   Other than that, the app is good and a must-have application in every phone 👍 
Best app, i love it⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️✨
Great app. Seamless communication. Will work on the moon if tested I guess
its a very useful app. just i wish i could select more photos to send together.
The picture quality on status needs to be good and clearly. Aside that the app is great
The best app ever thanks WhatsApp
For the second time in like 3 years it just says that it needs to recover all chats, but since I have way more data than it can backup I just end up losing everything. Well, thank you whatsapp for deleting everything i wont be able to recover 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙄
This latest update of whatsapp has some serious issues guys please fix them. Especially when trying to retrieve an old conversation, it keeps loading for a long period and retrieves nothing. Previously I used to just type one word in the search bar and it would retrieve instantly!!
Please bring all Telegram’s features.
I love the fact that there’s always room for improvement on WhatsApp, makes the app evolve even more and more than ever. I love this app, I think I may say it’s been a blessing to the world at large. Thank you Developer 🙏
Your app is the best
I can contact people way easier and I get messages faster .. but can they add a way to change the color of the chat bubbles
En este momento WhatsApp me estaría andando mal, me aparecen las notificaciones de Mensajes que ya leí
We can use the app instantly , no need to waste the time for login. Interface is awesome and easy. Best app ever. 
La aplicaciòn de WhatsApp es màs ràpida en cuánto enviar fotos y mensajes haciendo la comunicaciön con mis amigos màs efectiva.
prodrian ampliar la opcion de crear sala grupal pero de video llamada por ejemplo uno manda la video llamada y varias personas te ves ejemplo como en live de la aplicacion meetme
Please fix this issue Always ask for re verification number when i open the apps in 6s 
Love
I’m new here , but so far I like 👌🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Es súper fácil estar en contacto con la familia y con los amigos.
Me gusta mucho por que puedo hablar con mi familia que vive muy lejos de aquí
For us simpler folk.  I find that 99% of those who send unwanted ads to us on the net have excessive text. Very off-putting; egoistic; my precious time    -wasting!   DO SOMETHING about this if you care. Addressed to the good guys who want to improve human life quality and love our planet. 
Love this app
Muy buena aplicación para mensajería y llamadas gratis, me encanta lo uso a diario y no tengo ningún problema
جميل ولكن لو يطول وقت المرسل
I love this app! It is easy, user friendly and simple. Great for messaging friends around the world, sending voice notes and sharing videos and pictures! Calls and video calls work great and none of these things eat away at my data like other apps. The one thing I do not like is that it tells others when I am online. And the majority of people think online means available. It drives me nuts. Sometimes I am perfectly available when I'm offline and super unavailable when I am online. There is no way to turn off this feature and there should be...
See above
I hate that I have to download pictures sent to me on this app. Once I download them they are then automatically saved to my picture gallery. After chatting with my friends while working all day I have to spend every evening deleting the photos and memes we’ve exchanged. Update the IOS app to allow me to view only...
my family lives in D.R and I can’t use message nor FaceTime to see nor write them now with what’s up I can write and see my family I recommend this to people who have family far away
I use SE Almost every open this, force close again and again often  Thanks for ur response 
Thanks for this Apps
Lo mejor de universo
I have set up whatsapp notifications exactly how i want them.  That means Badges only. However, whatsapp keeps nagging me to enable notifications. It clearly wont be satisfied until i allow it to interrupt me constantly.   So in summary: its as useful as the built in text messaging app on my phone, but more annoying by design.   Taking away the notifications nag would make it a 5 star app.

We love Christ!
I love this app it’s the best
For some reason, I can't download any media sent to me regardless of whether I am using WiFi or cellular data.
❤️❤️
Please increase the “limit” of selecting more than 10 images from “Photos” app on iOS to share to WhatsApp contacts
Coco
Lost one star for spotty reception and dropped calls but it’s absolutely excellent at texting and photos and call quality is still better than Skype. Some things are out of control of the app 😉
The fact that I can’t have a choice of stopping people who are not in my contacts from adding me to unsolicited whatsapp group is the biggest flaw of whatsapp and the reason I don’t like using it
love it
الاتصال ضعيف جداً نرجوا منكم تفعيل خاصية الاتصال ولكم جزيل الشكر
WhatsApp is the most useful app in a generation. It has saved many of its users lots of expense.
Thank you it's good but in china got blocked ):
Se me borraron todos los chats e imagenes con ellos, solo con la ultima actualizacion
ليش ماتحطون اتصال صوتي وفيديو
Love this app. My family who are semi retired seniors not too familiar with new technology were impressed when I introduced them to WhatsApp. Now we can connect anytime (well at least within the 8 hr time difference) for FREE. On our cell phones, anywhere, anyplace. No longer stuck with the landline at home. 💖👍🏻
I love it so much! I moved to another country for good, so now only with whatsapp i can talk to all my relatives and see them in great hd quality! Thank you so much
This new update was amazing before when someone calls while I was recording a message about 5 minutes or more It will delete and I\'ll get upset but thanks to the new update that dosent happen any more  but before the update I can use other apps while listening to voice messages from the WhatsApp and  and the recording will still be playing I loved that but know that dosent happen anymore once you leave the app the voice message you played will stop until you resume to the app  so I hope you guys can bring that back again thank you very much 
Love this app !! Use it every day
Call quality has gone down hill
Diablo209
I never had a problem with the app and use it for all my distant friends around the world! Thanks
we should and option to download whatsap on older devices whatsap is the best social app and i cant use im my 3gs 
I always facing delay of notification   Even I reinstalled also same problem 
Very good
Good Work
This is a one good app 👍
Wish you can just enter a phone number instead of having to creat a contact first. Some times it's just for a one off or short time period. Hate to put those in Contacts.   It would also be nice to text multiple people without having to creat a "group". One of the most annoying features. 
افضل برنامج للمحادثات على الاطلاق
Is the easiest way to comunícate, the future is here ...!
Please creating channel like telegram app  The making group and other options of telegram app is better too 
Very bad
Because I can't restore my pack up even i have pack up (3.84GB) and a good network
I love whatsapp! It's amazing but every once in a while I'll delete it and I would back up all my stuff! Yet we I go to restore it, it never restores! It'll say 2kb out of 905kb restored for as long as an hour!
It should do the little bubbles when there typing and that is all I have to say.
People in whatsapp review good on telling story. Review should be simple but here in comments they doing some textbook journal paper. To whatsapp, you give what people want you get what you want. 5 stars. Keep it simple, faster and economical. 
My phone was a bit error earlier, but after I turned it on again I received message on WA but no actual message there. I tried restarting and even back-up and uninstalling the app, but still no luck! Is this new bug after the update? Please do fix it!! It might be important messages! Thanks!
Y no sólo es lo mejor, sino que está siempre disponible... Gracias.
This is a great application
Its a good platform to connect families and friends who are far away from from home and can't afford international calls. My outgoing calls are free worldwide but sometimes I don't have good connectivity to my phone network ( my home), so I use whatsapp to call and see my family. Sharing jokes , news , pictures , videos and what not.. whatsapp has been an important part of life.
Wasat es la que más uso y estoy muy bien comunicado y excelente la videos llamadas gracias
Should put an option to hide the on line thing..go visible! Please
What's app is amazing I love it
I have friends all over the world mostly in Europe and I’m in California so it makes me it easy to connect with friends all over the world thank you very much I love the south.  Barbara nolan 
I have been using this app for about 3 years now, but lately I am not happy with the app at all cause it is EXTREMELY SLOW!!! It takes forever for massages to be delivered. If this problem continues I am gonna have to delete the app and start using an other app.
Cool.
Best social app
Thank you very much and thank goodness
Muy bonis
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Making it more secure by putting a passcode on the app
WhatsApp has become the messaging standard throughout the world! Enough said!
Great Ap!
Easy to use and Great to communicate and keeping in touch 👍
Got the WhatsApp after over-hearing friends talking about it. Nice auto install that grabbed all my contacts with WHatsApp accounts, so had an instant contact list. Surprised me how many of my friends use WA. The phone service is very clean sounding and has given me confidence to consider getting voip at my house to replace the Verizon service. I even got the app on my Mom’s cell phone so she can call her sister in Europe. No down side yet, except they could use a tips & hints page for old schoolers like me.
iPhone 4 doesnot work with updated version it doesnot download and or open at all really bad  DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS LATEST UPDATE 
It’s good to Tex but it’s not good to call
ارجو اضهار الصورة الشخصيه لانها لاتضهر عندي
I think it was better than now.
Why you dont have channel like telegram?
I can not call or video chat😞
Google and Apple have been trying to get this right for years!! What a well done app that works flawlessly across my phone and computer.  This is one of my all-time favorite apps!!!! 
in this update it is so bad
Seriously! I’m tired of all the bugs in this app. The amount of crash data you guys have must be astronomical! WHY CAN’T YOU FIX THE CRASHES?????   After Facebook buy this app, it became freaking garbage.  Sometimes I think wpp has like 2 or 3 employees, because they simply can fix bugs! In this update, the app simply freezes out of nowhere!!! Seriously fix these bugs!!!!! Telegran is on another level already. 
한국어 사용자이며 최근 업데이트 이후 행간, 줄간 간격이 이전보다 많이 좁아져서 보기에 불편합니다. 이전이 더 여유있게 느껴졌습니다.
The best group messenger app
Whatsapp added a great functionality of being able to listen to voice notes with the app in the background. This feature proved extremely useful for long voice notes to not be restricted to staying in that conversation window. Then they decided to remove that feature in the new update. I don't get how they thought this was a good idea. 
very very good
Recent update solved the probrem eith voice massages.  Works good now.  Thanks for immidiately reaction👍
I enjoy WhatsApp every day with friends and family. One think they should make to be better is making audio playing automatically with one click on first one. I know you guys can make it. Please make it!
Please PLEASE FIX THE ISSUE WHERE IF YOUR LEAVING SOMEONE A VOICE MESSAGE AND YOUR PHONE RINGS IT ERASES THE ENTIRE MESSAGE AND YOU HAVE TO START OVER FROM THE BEGINNING. IT'S SO SO FRUSTRATING
Only one little problem with it, You need to update the app to work with iPhone X. For  some reason when viewing friends photos in recent status won’t fit the screen. Only half the photo is visible. Calls and video calls won’t work on my iPhone either, when I give it a try it will just freeze my phone. Please correct this problem as soon as posible as I travel a lot abroad and I can’t get full advantage of the app....
Super
The app is great. But my notifications won’t come in half of the time. I won’t even know that I received calls unless I directly open the app myself.
Video and audio freezes
The share location is always not accurate and provides with wrong location every time
Muy buena aplicación
نرجوا تطويل مدة ارسال الفيديوا بدل دقيقه ونصف الي عشر او خمس دقائق وشكرا لكم 
An update for iOS 7 ???  Are you kidding.
Would be nice if you can set your own customized tones for notifications so that you know who it is that’s messaging you instead of the default custom tones
Me parece una grosería que una empresa tan grande como whatsapp nos haya quitado algunas opciones a los que nos quedamos en iOS 10 por tener un iPhone 5, como lo son dibujar en fotos y estados o poner emojis como normalmente lo hacen los que tienen iOS 11 hacia arriba 🤷🏻‍♂️.
None of my messages are being sent with the new update.  Or at least it’s only showing a single Grey checkmark next to each one
Back home in Africa.
It is great to know this App works fine with mu iPhone 4 and iOS 7 ! please, add compatibility with the Mac for this device !
It’s pretty good I just wish it was better
❤️👍
This app is awesome for chatting and audio / video calling. Though friends and family seems so far away but they appear so close through this app.
This app has been very useful in keeping our many long distance relationships
Review ??   Write a review is what they want and I haven’t used the APP so what’s the point ?  Alright let’s get to the point... seems like a nice enough app !
I wish we could save voice notes
Great app... a lot of my friends and family use this app. Only bad thing is it backs up everything and fills up your phone because it automatically downloads media that is sent to you and all your chat history.... takes up too much space and wants you to delete apps to make space for this one... relax I did not ask for you to archive everything....even when I take the option off, for some reason what\'s app is a space hoarder and my phone has to ask me to delete apps for space....That\'s the only thing going against it....
So if someone ever go on WhatsApp and I’m trying to write somebody the messages has one check on there and it doesn’t go through so sick I have to restart my phone each time does he get the messages to go through and then there’s a first example one person was last online around 3 o’clock latest message me now around like 730 is still so that they were last online at 3 o’clock not seven
Está muy bien así como lo tienes ahora , a veces lo han cambiado mucho antes y lo cambian por mal pero si piensan renovarlo que sea para mejorar más no como hiendo atrás ...
After i updated the ios software to 11.2.1 all whatsapp call i place on hold end automatically after 10 seconds, any fix to this issue ? 
1 STAR UNTIL THEY UPDATE LISTENING TO AUDIOS OUTSIDE OF THE APP. WHY CHANGE THIS FEATURE!!?!??!?!,???$3&:929;):&8747
This app was introduced to me a month ago! It’s honestly one of my favorite apps! Everyone should try it!
Dfhfghgdhdhdbhdhddjdjhf
It’s working very well  Thanks... 
Please bring the dark theme in to the WhatsApp 🙏🏻
This is a huge and disappointing update! Huge! Please reverse the update! The point of this app is to listen in case you’re doing something else like driving. This new update is dangerous. Please fix this so we can be able to listen to voice notes while on the main screen or in different apps! I use this app constantly. I would pay money how much I use it. I drive a lot. With this new update I will not be using it that much anymore! The app is great otherwise but this update is bad
Why I can’t mark the groups all and delete messages one time or delete for two simple steps I have more than 800 groups for my work and I hate to delete the group messages one by one thanks for your support.
Technology should make things easier, not more difficult.
Great social media app to interact with your friends and family!
It’s 2017 and this app is still looking like day 1, we need some customizations, change the color of the messages bubbles or add a dark mode theme. This app is being used by millions of people and should look way better. Please update
After update blue sign (send&receive) not appear
Dejen de copiar a Telegram!

WhatsApp has the best quality for long distances calls. There is no lag and it is fast in contact, sending and receiving text messages. I love WhatsApp.
Dear Sir/Madam,  Hi! Good day to you. My name is Fong from Malaysia. Yesterday I update WhatsApp latest version 2.18.10 for my iPhone 6s Plus.  But after complete update WhatsApp, I unable to open the WhatsApp. When open the screen become full screen white color, then suddenly flash back to home screen.   I can’t deleted the WhatsApp app because I got a lot data haven’t backups yet.  Kindly please help me solved this problem ASAP!  Regards  Fong 
After latest update, sent, delivered and seen tick mark disappeared.
I breath WhatsApp day and night.
Nice app, great features, but please fix issues with the status count. I updated and it stopped counting.
Easy - Fast - Simple - Dependable.. ALWAYS WORKS... A fantastic tool that is such a relief from FBook. my go to when communicating from America to Europe and back  .. keep up the good work .. WhatsApp ..
There is not option to delete all the archived chats. No option to clear chats for all groups together. If you select groups + individual chats, the delete option is disabled. It should delete individual chats and exit and delete the groups.
The new update ruined this for me. I would play audio sent in conversation and go to check my email in the meantime or go online and the audio would still be in the background. Now it stops when I try to leave the app. It stops my life as well. I don't have time to sit there inside of the app forever!
The background use was eliminated from the app in the latest version. Please, reintegrate it!
I updated WhatsApp based on “Bug fixes” launched two days ago, and now the app will not open. The app immediately crashed after the update. I’ve tried restarting my phone and turning it on and off and nothing seems to be working. When I click on the app the screen turns white then crashes.
I updated the app on 8 January and since then, it's not even working   Please fix 
Crash it when move up and down in private chatting  Ios 8 .4 - iphone 5S 
The worst update for iphone 5 and ios 7.1.2!! Please fix it asap!
Best massager app that i have ever had ♥️♥️  I really like it  And i can do all i need with it 
Not working , the app is not launching
I love it my friend love you too I get to video chat so awesome it’s the best thing I gave it five stars I love it
When read group chat it suddenly closed Ios 8.3 
What’sapp isn’t working anymore after i updated. It’s not even opening. Pls fix as soon as possible!
Love it!!. I get my friends and members of my family in many countries!
This app was a great asset to our family when our grandson was in Rome for study abroad. We were able to talk to him and see pictures he took of all the great sites he toured. This is a perfect way to stay connected any where!
Please update this version - I can't even get to WhatsApp on my phone anymore!!! It immediately force crashes, I'm not receiving any messages or notifications!!! FIX PLEASE
So my iPad had an update and now this app is not compatible with my device. Fix it please.
Walk softly talk softly accept with humility   Return what does not belong to you   Soar.   Roar. One.happy . Love. Only one path the.     Less taken.  Night is your friend.  Karma   Kicks.  Life is a circle. It will come around   Always. Betrayal begets betrayal. Listen to.   Your moral compass don’t and compress. 
What happened?? I enjoyed this app because I could close the app and still listen to voice messages. Now I have to keep the app open. This is a horrible update
Me gusta muchooooo
Con la última actualización Whatsapp se cierra sólo, el texto de congela al escribir, desaparecieron las confirmaciones de mensajes, quedo súper lento.
Not being able to continue to listen to voice messages while using other apps is so frustrating. We want to be able to multitask like we used to!
La aplicación en muy buena. Pero para mí gusto sería imprescindible que tuviera la opción de “salir” de la sesión... de apagarla a gusto. Espero que pronto la incorporen. 
All my calls without airpods are failed
Whats app is the best app ever
I use the app daily and it hasn't been opening since the update.
I am 52 years old and I’ve known about Facebook for many a year and chose not to do Facebook however I had a sister who died two years ago and she always kept in communication with our old school mates family people in different countries where we’ve traveled and haven’t seen since kids and so now that I’ve got on Facebook I’m so happy I have friends around the world from childhood and also friends reaching out to me to reach out to other friends , friends who I have found who has children with other friends who didn’t even know about their child,one friend didn’t even know he had a 30yr old daughter, my other friends children were found also through Facebook in the United States, Canada and Europe. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️five stars for Facebook🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽x24
This app is perfect when Power is out. Just perfect all around
Is the best app to keep families together. Thank you
I can’t mute the camera sound with the new update!!! Not even on silent
Please send another update, that last one won’t let me open my whatsapp and 5 of my friends told me the same thing. I WON’T DELETE THE APP because that would mean deleting all of my memories. Please do something about it.
Cannot even open the app that it will close right away. Anyone can help with this?
It would be great if I could connect to whatsapp just using my laptop. Now with China blocking Whatsapp without a vpn, it is hard to communicate with family back in the states. I use Whatsapp when my VPN works (not as often as I would like it to). I tried using it on my laptop but I can only use it when my phone is connected to wifi and vpn. Maybe you can use a password to login or something so I can at least talk with family/friends on my laptop while I’m abroad.
After I updated last version Whatsapp can’t backup to iCloud
אתמול קיבלתי הודעה שאצטרך לפנות 6 גיגה מהאיחסון שלי. פיניתי אפילו 12 גיגה והאפליקציה עדיין לא עבדה לאחר שלחצתי נסה שוב המון פעמים כיביתי את הטלפון והדלקתי מחדש החלטתי למחוק את האפליקציה ובצער רב נמחקו לי כל השיחות ...😰😰😰😰
Best app ever
José
No deja adelantar videos al inicio en un iPhone 7 plus
又話 bug fix, fix 到開都開唔到！咁多隻 IM 得 whatsapp 咁白痴要連住手機先可以用網版，而家完全收唔到 message。唔係公司要用送都唔要。
Since the last update i cant hear my message while the the application run in the background.
The tick icon on messages are not showing on the latest update! It's glitched out i think! Please fix it.
Consistent.
You’re the best. Love the way you optimize app for iOS, especially if I get a call while recording an audio, the recording so far will be gone, now I can send it later after the call. Awesome♥️
Latest updates on Jan 9, 2018 keeps crashing. WTH?
Ha sido una gran ayuda para muchas personas al rededor del mundo!!! Gracias 
now is ok 👍🏻thanks
The app has been crashing since I updated the WhatsApp yesterday. I have rebooted the phone multiple times but nothing has changed. I don’t want to delete the app itself because I got a ton of chat history and media files in there. I don’t want to lose them. Please fix this issue.
This app is awesome, make phone calls to my relatives and sent texts is so easy I love the way how this app works,  easy easy 👏🏽👏🏽👍🏽
I have been waiting for almost 3 months whiles others are getting new updates like emojies and other thing the only update I get is bug fixes and it's making me sad
BUT, the new update won’t let me exit out so I can play on my phone while still listening. That was my favorite feature! My friends and I send over 10 min long messages and it’s really inconvenient to have to stay in the app. PLEASE GO BACK TO THE OTHER WAY.
I love WhatsApp because it does not take data just internet love it 😍❤️
Love how I can connect with family in Italy!
Yesterday my phone did its usual automatic updates and among those was Whatsapp. When i tried opening it, it didn’t work. It shuts by itself automatically. I tried all the troubleshooting and nothing worked. Please help because all your debugging just killed my App.
Terrible change! Please change back.. thanks...
No puedo ver si alguien me dejo en visto, ni siquiera si se envio el mensaje.
There is a blank space instead of the ✅ marks for the sent/delivered/read  You just hear the sound of it but otherwise it has disappeared from all chats 
I cant hear music out of whatsapp thats new and i dont like it.
Please create an app for Apple watch , Thank you
Every single time it crashes. Please, fix the bug.
This is really good and it’s free i use this to send messages especially multiple pics if the user is has android
Finally! Whatsapp is getting better & better! Thanks for keeping us connected to our love one! 💕💕💕😘😘😘 looking forward for “beyond” expectation updates! 🤣😘😘
I appreciate your effort on making the app better everyday. But, you guys need to improve the quality of the app’s camera.  There should some reaction buttons for the users’ statuses just like Messenger. 
Is there any way in your app that i can clear cach my whatsapp like what i do in my telegram app?(i dont wanna loose my data)
Have gone through 3 different phones and have kept all my chats and now it erased all my chats what in tarnation
For some reason I can’t even tell if someone saw my text, at most it’ll be delivered
Excellent
I have family and friends all over the world doing the Lord’s work. I can stay in touch using WhatsApp!!!! ❤️
I cant open my whatsapp in need the new update to fix the bug
Not at all good
Bug: Not getting notifications after updating to 2.18.10  Requests: 1. Option to share live location for longer periods of time.  2. Option to Select multiple archived conversations to delete or unarchive them.  3. Option to Share iPhone screen during video call.  4. Group Video Call. 
My what’s app not working
App will not launch after update - hope that gets resolved or we switch apps.
I've been using WhatsApp for years to speak to family all over the world through voice messages. With this new update you can now no longer listen to a voice message as the app runs in the background while doing something else on your phone. I hate it and was completely unnecessary to make that change. Please fix it as it's making me not want to use the app at all.
I can no longer listen to voice messages while using other apps. This update disabled that option, which was extremely helpful. Please bring it back.  The app is super slow, the banner stating I need to launch the app to continue receiving notifications is also quite annoying. 
WhatsApp allows to communicate with friends and family all over the world. It’s secure servers allows users to enjoy a faster message delivery rate.
Plsssssssss can u put on your app a dark mode?
While I open stat, it's close by itself.
It's a basic texting app. Works well so long as servers are up which they usually are. Once in awhile they go down but it's only happened to me twice in the year I've used it.   My real issue is the horrible lack of customization. You can change the chat background color. And that's it. But, the chat bubbles are gray and green. So if you want a pink background hope you like pink and green! If even pay to change the default theme!  Various other annoyances with the UI but it works. 
The simplest way to stay in touch with my friends around the world.
I love the app but I think they should do an extreme change, like changing the stile, like Instagram but you can keep the logo😉
Great app, but no longer updating as of 9Jan2018.
Good
Pleas dont copy telegram 🙂
Tengo problemas con la última actualización en mi iPhone 4, no pedo observar los checks de entregado y visto.
Abren uno podía escuchar los mensajes de voz saliendo de la app . Ahora sales del app y el mensaje se detienen
100% pleased with this app.
After last update, cannot access my WhatsApp account all of a sudden
My last update crashed my Whatsapp.. It began to “optimize” and now why i open it, it shuts down
It’s not working and I can’t delete it because there is an important informations what i really need 😩 PLEASE fix it
If any app has reached its full potential, and still strives to improve every day, it is Whatsapp. I thank their team for connecting me with my family in a beautiful seamless way, across oceans and continents.
This is a pretty good communication app, but the latest update has resulted in multiple crashes when I try to open it.
Works great on wifi good to keep in contact with friends if your phone service goes out you can still keep in contact
My WhatsApp application no longer opens since this morning. When I click to open I briefly see a blank screen and then nothing. Nothing has changed except you did a bug fixes update yesterday. 
When I’m texting, the letters and some caracteres freezes, and then the written text appears. I did re-installed the app, but it is still doing it.
I LIKE IT BUT SOME TIMES THERE ARE TO MANY SCAMMERS THAT SOME HOW GWT ACCESS TO WHATSAPP BY CLICKING ON ANY PHONE # AND I WISH THERE SOME KIND OF TYPE OF SECURE TO ENSURE THE SCAMMERS WILL NOT HET ACCESS TO WHATSAPP VIA PHONE # THANKS 
Really good app! Only been using for about a week, but I’m really appreciating it. It would be great if the video call had the ability to rotate the camera.
After the update " bug fixed" When i send a massege to anyone , i dont see any ticks , no grey ticks and no blue ticks .. The ticks has just disappeared
This app keeps you connected to your loved ones in foreign land!
Eh
I love WhatsApp and all it’s functions. It is one of the apps I use the most but one thing that really bum me out is the fact that they haven’t innovated or maintained up to date with technology. The two things that will make this app my favorite is a way to make polls in group chats. Imagine being able to know who is going to the event by just clicking “Assisting” or “Not going”. Imagine being able to decide which photo to upload to Instagram by just letting people choose the one they prefer or even tell you which shoes to buy. The other thing that would improve the app would be Apple Watch compatibility. Being able to tell Siri to send a message right from your wrist or even respond whenever you want and not just when they send a message to you.   Thanks, 
What happened to the different color names like before? Now they’re all one color ... still get five stars though 👌🏾
Love it! I get to talk with friends in far away places🎶🎶🎶🎶
New updates are but there is new bugs for me .  no sent, delivered or seen symbol . This is annoying . 
Please fix the bug issues, thanks
منتازين
My only complaint with this app is the ‘online status’. This is a perfect way to be ‘cyber stalked’.   If I could turn off this ‘feature’ I’d rate this app 4.5-5 stars.   Why can’t I have privacy?! 
I like WhatsApp, but if an option of passcode or & touch id could be added to the app (WhatsApp) i’m would really appreciate it.
I can connect to my family and friends everyday using it from US to India.
The new update had stopped the application to play the voice records while working on other applications!! Please fix this issue. 
I used to love WhatsApp, but this new update has taken the ability to listen to voice messages while doing other things on your phone. Please bring that convenience back.
افضل برنامج
Just update the latest version of whatsapp and it stopped working and when ever I open the app the phone restarting it's like they add bugs not fixed the bugs

The app doesn't show me the tickets, please fix for iPhone 4!!!
Se me cierra el whatsapp! Nuevamente no puedo entrar con la nueva actualización
Been using this app for years love it but not happy since update no indications ( checks) to let you know if message was sent, delivered, or read im not very happy about that at all! 😡.  Please fix it!
Why did you remove the feature of keep listening the voice notes even outside the app?  WHYYYYY? 
Love it
perdi todas as minhas conversas importantes, vão tomar no cu, vou usar telegram!
Just do the update and it doesnt open the app please fixit
Great phone app and pretty decent desktop app. BUT PLEASE, add a video calling option for desktop versions, Mac and PC!
Staying in touch with loved ones who travel overseas can become VERY expensive...unless you have Wifi and WhatsApp. We've become big fans of this because it doesn't matter what type of phone you have or where you are in the world. It just works and it makes sense. Love it!
Best messaging app!!
Es lo mejor,,,,pues no existe distancia con las personas que viven en otro país...te sientes mas cerca .
Después de esta última actualización se cierra solo 😳
Ever since the 2.18.10 update my app hasn’t been opening. Please fix that :)
Ok whatsapp why are so you put exit when you have no space literally what if yo have no service I literally had no service and then your like oh no space exit what if someone has a problem and needs my help then I fixed that problem and deleted photos but then I noticed when I clicked on camera or mic it says to go to setting to enable it and I never unable it and then it takes me to the setting where it says WhatsApp and it says nothing to enable a camera I search it up and it says to go to  some photo thing so I can turn it on WhatsApp the photos and mic and it shows nothing all it shows is apps that have requested to access to you will appear hear please fix this I did nothing to WhatsApp I like it but this is frustrating
I love it,,
I’m really blessed how we can keep in touch with people all over the world! 🙏🏼
The power of the club, yyeeeaaaahhhhhaaaaaa bboooyyyy!!!!!!
Con al actualización no me deja entrar a WhatsApp lo que sucede es que automáticamente se me sale de la pantalla aplicación pido asistencia lo mas rápido que se pueda
I can't even see the chat screen. I see a white screen and it closes. This is after the recent update. Please fix. I use an iPhone 7+. But when I check the running apps, I see it's still there.
WhatsApp is without a doubt the best social networking app I’ve ever used. And I’ve been using it for more years than I can count. Pretty much from the beginning.  And as times and technology have changed and advanced, so have the app’s features and capabilities.   Now for the reason I had to take off a star: Despite WhatsApp’s developments and advances it is still terribly behind in one area. And that is creating an app for Apple Watch users. Or at least a functional notification and response menu. So that when you receive a voice message from someone, you can actually listen to it without having to go to your phone. Which is the whole point of Apple Watch in the first place. And regarding the response options. It would be nice to be able to send more than one single emoji back, or to reply with a voice message, or at least proof/change your dictated message  if there’s a mistake in it.   Basically make an Apple Watch WhatsApp app!! Or improve existing interface for it 
I lost all my information and my chats Yesterday. I was trying to open my  app. But that never happened. I am very mad
When will WhatsApp be available to use on Apple Watch?! Would rate a 5 if this was an option.
I just downloaded the latest version, it crashes and crashes every time I try to open it. The support team wasn’t even helpful when I reached them. Had to delete the app and download it again
После обновления приложение критует ! Исправьте!!! 
Not showing delivery/read "check" sign on iPhone 4 (7.1.2 FW) anymore!
PLEASE get rid of status and bring back FAVORITES!! It was a quick and easy way to find contacts I haven\'t messaged yet or haven\'t messaged in a long time to call or start a convo with!!!!
Fantastic App, I don’t know what the life would be without.
Great app but disappointed that I lost all my messages when I changed phones.
Depois dessa ultima atualização ficou muito ruim, esta saindo toda hora..
Help I updated and the app isn't launching on my iPhone 6.
I tried to close the app and restart the phone. I still can’t launch it with the last update. Do something it keeps crashing I can’t even make a manual back up!
I am unable to c any of my chats with the latest update!!!
This program is very versatile and helpful. The videos are very good and communication become very helpful.   I wish you best for the persons who wrote this program and features are very good.  This program should not be used for false information.   It’s a very nice and simple to use. 
I get very angry because I was a POW, and sometimes I send people very agitated messages. Then I wish I could take back what I said, and not mean all the mean stuff. Please anybody reading this, who knows me. Don’t let that dictate your life, like it did mine. You know me.
Por alguna extraña razón no me aparecen los chequecitos de "enviando, entregado, visto" ninguna
The last update is a disaster 😡
We are bored of the bad update every time I do a software update that starts with phone problems!
Whatsapp, you've got to be kidding me. I keep complaining about how the text bubble is thick and you keep making it larger. I use an iPhone and my text is the smallest, and when I sent a text message the text bubble is huge it used to be smaller and thinner it looked more appealing engaging. When I wanted to see what was the problem with the text bubble, I changed the text size to the normal text size were all iPhones have the that size. when I checked Whatsapp again with the normal text size, the text bubble was huge! It was as if I put my text to the largest size!! Please Whatsapp, I'm begging you, fix this issue! It's giving me a hard time texting. :(
Peveefqrfgywtgwtvwhywyhwhh uhwftqgthubwurhgwtvwtvyeuwkiuwjwhnuwjh yebggvwgbeybrujidjuehhuh
It’s best app I liked this app❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I can’t open it 😭😭
After the update this morning i coupd not read the receipts anymore! So now when i send a message i cant see if the message was sent,neither open or read!! Its terrible   Fix this pleaz ASAP
It is efficient, safe and reliable I would have given a full five star but the calls are not usually clear sometimes but regardless it’s good.
The camera shutter won’t turn off even though my phone is on vibrate mode. It was possible before this update.
The bold function doesn’t work since the recent update!!!! Fix it please
Great app but Telegram is way way better, many more features better security etc
What The hall has happened to video Calls ?  It's ringing and I'm 100% sure the other party presses that answer button but we don't get through at all and All I get is a Missed Call 
I connect with my brother who lives in CANADA
The app crashed during the “optimization WhatsApp” message and now it won’t even start. The app Keep Crashing and I’m locked out!  Do not even install this update. I should have suspected that an update that contains only “bug fixes “ (according to the update description) but starts with “optimization WhatsApp “ message is not to be trusted... Thanks WhatsApp.. I’ll be available on telegram. 
My WhatsApp is not working every time I get in, it takes me out
Great app, needs stickers though!
Needs improvement in a monthly terms
It crashes all the time, I need an upgrade ASAP  I USE THIS APP EVERY SINGLE DAY AND I LOVE IT WHEN IT WORKS!  Please help me 
I can’t open the WhatsApp it’s always crashes can you fix it thanks ❤️
Whatsapp auto updated and doesn’t open anymore. It says bug fixes in the update yet it literally broke the app.
Excellent and a necessity
5 stars
I have been loving ever since it has started. I love the updates most and please do something where All group messages can be deleted at once.   Regards, Manishanker Somavarapu, Hyderabad, India. 
What should I do?? Pressed home button but still couldn’t access...Pls tell me
Only thing is I wish you could react to messages the same way you can on Facebook messenger. Also the call quality isn’t as great...
It’s not working after updating on my iPhone 6  Please fix 
Please bring back the feature that allows you to finish listening to your voice note even if you minimize the app
Por favor criem um app para Apple Watch
WhatsApp! Why did you “fix bugs” and make it so that when I listen to a voice note I have to stay in the app in order to listen to the whole thing. Before I could play a voice note and move to other apps while still listening to the voice note. Please don’t be like iMessage! You are guys were doing so well!
I loved I can share media text pics Great 
The App is great for contacts outside my own country. I wish it integrated with a translator so it could automatically translate to my own language within the app. It’s tiring copy, switch to google translate, paste, translate, go back to app for next message. I have to do this at least 200 times a day. I also wish I didn’t have to save contacts in my phone book to add them to a chat.
🙌🏼🙌🏼 Love so much WhatsApp in IOS. Why not make some changes like UI To make it Better 🤤🤩
I can make live call, videos and send pictures with one App and with everyone in the world!
I just got the new update and whatsapp literally doesn't let me in. The app takes absolutely all the space on my phone and doesn't work right. Please do something to fix it
Carlos Torres
The best app so far and I don’t think it would be a better one
Excelente app
Best App Ever ❤️❤️❤️
I think you maybe change new designs. because it can get a easy for contacts menu. so Notifications. Format conversations. New main menu availability.
Una vaina bien 👉🏽💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾🙏🏾
Awli
Love the ap but next version hopefully it will work wit the Apple Watch where I can reply from watch.
This app has been perfect for keeping in touch w a friend who moved to Switzerland 😃
I am not able to make calls from my new iPhone X
It is so bad that you cannot see the WhatsApp user that are in your contacts anymore. You must Search them to see them! Please add the list with the written status again!!  The quality of stories is really bad please fix it! I love the option that you can customize the people you want to see your status! That’s perfect unlike instagram that you have to hide the people... thanks for this great option and please Don't change the appearance of the app into messenger of Facebook!!! 
Our family uses it when one or more are traveling abroad, great tool.
It is one of the messaging apps that i use most frequently, and it works like a charm!!🤩
Audio and video calls do not work. Every call goes right to failed and the other person thinks they are still on the line.
Calixi
The app still works like usual, which is already 5 stars, but random people now starts joining our groups. Can anyone help with this?
Telegram has done it, I use WhatsApp as my default texting app. But I’d like to have a night mode in WhatsApp, that’d be so cool. Hope you read this!!!! 
Rabii casa
I was skeptical but a distant friend suggested this app. So far it’s brilliant! The functionality is dependable and easy to figure out. Very intuitive to me. I’ve only used it for a week and so far it scores perfect! 100% 👍🏼
Lo mejor que se puede tener.
I love whatsapp, i use it to communicate with my friends and family but lately i haven’t been receiving texts unless i double text the person then i’ll get the reply, or my message will be on sent and only deliver once i check the app again and it’s so annoying because i have to be double texting people in order for their message to get to me fix this pls
Works great on my iPhone and Web, but Apple Watch support is lacking for notifications. Please add support!
❤️❤️
Muga mucho
خمس نجوم⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
WhatsApp did more than Facebook to connect people around the world.
Recurring messages circulating videos from multiple friends are pain time consuming to delete. Develop a method to prevent receiving them again. 
Dios es bueno hoy y siempre y por los siglo de los siglos amen !!!
Why whatsapp crash every time I open it I deleted it and installed it twice and it's still crash help please
This is the best way to keep in touch with friends who live everywhere from Amsterdam to Saudi Arabia to New Zealand.
Great way to stay connected
Mundo. Gracias
Job
Helps my friends and me stay in touch across the world!
This app is so awesome! Super easy and fast way to be able to connect with life long friends!
Love it giving it a five star
Sirve, dada la repercusión que tiene entre la gente, pero tiene dos cosas muy malas no respeta la privacidad y solo se puede usar en un dispositivo y otorgándole nuestro numero de teléfono.
Muy buena app
I’m not sure WhatsApp even needs positive reviews. It’s a great product. It sells itself.   Call anyone on earth who has a smartphone and the WhatsApp app and talk 24 hours a day forever for free. The world wasn’t like this when I was a kid.  What WhatsApp adds is security. The New York Times urges political activists who live in dangerous countries where the government might listen in and arrest you . . .   to use WhatsApp, because it is secure. That’s good enough for me.   It also does the usual: you can (text) message back and forth, you can send photographs or web links, you can video chat.   I LOVE sending photographs because you tap one button and your camera is open within the app, you take the photo, and then you tap a button if you want to send it to your friend. That’s as simple as it could possibly be. I love being able to walk and carry on a conversation and send photos of what I’m talking about seamlessly as if I’d been doing it my entire life.   Download this app. Choose nice wallpaper. I don’t know how anyone will ever be able to improve on what it is right now. It’s perfect. 
Me gusta Whatsap porque puedes enviar mensajes a tus familias o amigos es una manera muy fácil para comunicarse con tus amistades
It’s the best!!
Love that the creators of this app are very innovative, keep coming up with new features to meet today’s ever changing environment
It needs to add the ability of sending files and music
excelente aplicación muy eficiente e unica
Love your services.  Thank you for your App
That excellent if work iPhone 7 Plus okay... I love my messenger WHATSAPP for iOS 7 new design minimalist 👌 good Apple ok. Thank you Whatsapp 👍.
The app is amazing and works great but PLEASE make Apple Watch app!!!
Esta genial basica y minimalista con las opciones concretas y necesarias👌
WhatsApp I think is the best social app to chat with friends, family and everyone else. And so far I can’t complain about anything. Just there is one thing that some people might enjoy, I know I would. Is if you could choose which people could view your profile photo. Because maybe if you put a profile photo up, certain people that don’t like you, may view it and message you about it saying nasty things.. or you may just want to keep your life private from those who are in your contacts but Arnt exactly a part of something you’d put on your profile photo.   Otherwise everything else is perfect! 
God Only
When the video is playing in the case of WTSB, it operates on a larger screen than the iPhone x
It’s fun
vv
They should have a choice where you can pick a username so you don’t have to give out your actual phone number... 😐
It’s quick, simple and helps people with iPhones easily keep in touch with non iPhone users. Wish it could handle larger photo files. But it’s free!!!!!
Would be five stars but Please add the like button
The invention of WhatsApp by Brian Acton and Jan Koum in 2009 after they left Yahoo in 2007 and took a long trip throughout South America, can be compared to the invention of the printing press by Gutenberg in 1439; the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) by John Mauchly, a 32-year-old professor at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, and John Presper Eckert Jr., a 24-year-old genius inventor and lab assistant; as part of secret World War II (WWII)  military project; the NASA space project ti which we owe most of the advances in telecommunications, propulsion and guidance systems and miniaturization in the last 55 years; and, the invention of the Internet in the early 1960s as part of the U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) directed by Robert Taylor and managed by Lawrence Roberts.  When the first message was sent over the ARPANET in 1969 from computer science Professor Leonard Kleinrock’s laboratory at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)ti the second network node at Stanford Research Institute (SRI) nobody thought about the future of the technology they had just invented. Exactly the same thing that happened with the stored program concept developed by Professor John von Neumann at Princeton University in 1945. He was offered $50,000 for his patent by a small and growing company, Internacional Tabulating Machines ((ITM) that then became International Business Machines (IBM), the gold old Big Blue or “I have Been Moved” as  its employees used to say. The offer was made in either cash or shares of IBM and he took the cash!  One of the largest customers of IBM’s predecessor was the German Nazi   government because of its methodical destructive terror conspiracy to eliminate Jews, gypsies, and mNy other non-Arian people and their own disabled and/or imcapacitated Arian compatriots. After WWII the German government provided the surviving relatives of the Holocaust victims very detailed inventories of what the Nazis were able to “harvest” from their victims (ounces of hair, shoes, belts, eyeglasses, dental crowns,  etc) and offering pitiful indemnizations. These inventories were produced from the data compiled by the Nazis using ITM equipment.    I had the privilege of taking an economics class with his daughter, Marina von Neumann Whitman, while she was a Professor at the Department of Economics at my Alma Mater, the University of Pittsburgh. She used to joke that her father who was one of the genius of the last century did not know the implications and potential of what he had invented and sold the patent very cheaply and if he had taken the IBM shares she would have been independently wealthy.  Today we can chat and exchange data, photos and videos and place phone calls with people throughout the world using WhatsApp and the best thing: It is absolutely free! After Facebook under the steady hand of Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Dr. Pricilla Chan, a pediatrician and philanthropist, acquired WhatsApp in 2014, its growth has been astronomical: as of a year ago WhatsApp had over 1.2 billion users. Figures do not lie but liars do figure! Especially given the current circus in Washington. 
My Roommate/Brother and mom went to the Philippines. The only way I could communicate with them is with this app!!! It was a very important trip out of the country and I wanted to be with them but I couldn’t. This app made it possible for me to be involved, be it in a small way. For that I love WhatsApp!!
Crashes all the time
Please add image account inside of every message that a person sent in group. Please let an user have more than just one image account Please put info for every message in groups not just for sender 
This app is great and one of my favorite but it’d be better if it had a log out option I always have to uninstall it and then reinstall it again :(
I love this app 👍
While recording voice message other party does not hear the voice.
Hi, I cannot use the app to make phone calls.  Although I reached out to the app’s customer support they kept sending me to the FAQ and nothing helped. Very poor support.

I used to love what’s app. But recently I’ve been using it and even with full set of bars. My messages won’t go through.
WhatsApp makes it so easy to stay in touch with my family abroad. It’s like calling from the next town
Me encanta WhatsApp 😍😍
You have to give them access to your contacts so they can sync it with their database. Only by doing this, you're giving out other people personal information without them knowing. You have to do this in order to use the app. It should be possible to check to see if someone uses the app without it being invasive.
What needs to be mentioned about WhatsApp? What more could anyone possibly need to communicate with loved ones overseas for free? And with simple texts permitted one can even talk send photos and videos? We must be in the future THANKS TO WHOMEVER MADE THIS POSSIBLE!!!
Change the emojis like you have done with the android phones.  Come on this is an iPhone.
This app is perfect for me. I travel constantly for work in many different regions of the world, and this is, by far, the best communication app I have ever used.   I can message and call back home and never worry about international rates.....just make sure you have a data connection! 
Voice calls are not so good.some interruptions are having with voice calls.please rectify the trouble and be world’s no 1.
This app is perfect especially when my family is out of the country! Easy to talk to them without the extra fees and! And I loooove the FaceTime feature
Why dont u put pasword for entering whatsapp for privacy and preventing anyone from seeing my chats
It is so better than the old messenger
I have a friend in India that I'm able to keep in touch with. Great app!
WhatsApp is the best way to stay in touch with anyone, anywhere. Period.
Easier and faster to send your message.  Free calling no matter the distance
Easy to deal with other people.
Lagging when download many video at once .. iphone 8 plus
First of all i appreciate your huge effort to give us all of useful services,  In my opinion if you come to us in new update that included Video filtration in (media,links&Docs) searches, it really will become very great and very very usefully,  To facilitate to users when they search on videos 
Fuckadoodledoo this is the BEST by FAR!
Night mode please 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
We want to read messages and receive calls from the apple watch!! Pleaassee doo that:(!!  And can you make multiple call in whatsapp? 
Soo cool you should get it too
Excellent
The biggest problem with whatsapp is cant send stickers in this app and. Sometimes a sticker can be great reply in a chat  Some other times whatsapp is slow and takes a while to load voice messages and medias 
It’s easy to use he has to many versions
Why is there no option for not agreeing? You guys do put up your terms but don’t give us any option of declining your terms! It’s a one way street isn’t it?
great apps! love it!
Mondragon
Like I-message but for overseas
Please make a version for the Apple Watch.
You guys are great. You should add the option of being able to add stickers to the texts. Thanks! 😊
Bueno esta vaina no sirve, no me abre la aplicación, dale que si y arrégleme mi vaina ya
💪💪💪
Since the iOS update a few weeks ago, I don’t receive many pictures sent to me, or messages! PLEASE FIX!
Best app eveeeeeeer
Thought you could make international phone calls as well.
Please add an option for Archived chats to stay ARCHIVED!
There are many problems in the application I wish to solve because it is disturbing feature stories when i choose just somepeople to see it  it does not appear for some and show for some others i have to delete the contact number and add again and sometimes the personal picture does not appear for some users i wish to solve these problems
Useful dependable
I like the app just hate when your tag in a group that said person sends 20 or more messages a day over load sometimes
Best way to stay close to your sissy’s 😘
This app is pretty great, easy to use, successful and the best of all is that you can share pictures, documents, phone numbers and more with your family and friends around the world completely free and you can use the app wherever you go just with a wi fi connection...
This App loads photos much faster than texting.   Works great for international traveling and keeping up with your friends back home!!! 👍
La funcionalidad y disfunción lo hacen la herramienta perfecta para centralizar las comunicaciones tanto en el ámbito personal como profesional.
I’m ok with the service I like whatt app but I suggest people should not be able to download your dp without ur permission thanks
Please add sticker
Unable to video chat individually or as a group
The new upgrade... The new location of the icons and names are very bad, very ugly and unpleasant, it is preferred as it was before, and not only do I disagree, don’t work the cals in iphone X
Buen trabajo.
Precisa de uma atualização para podemos responder às mensagens pelo Apple Watch! Need an update so we can respond to messages by Apple Watch! 
استیکر و ادیت هم اضافه بشه عالی میشه  مچکریم 
I’m  Having trouble   Making  calls  on  a  iPhone   X
Really good to rely on  Very quick to get text 
Due to relocation outside of the US, this app has been my “go to” and main source of communicating with family and friends.  I have tried other apps similar such as Skype, however his app by far is the best in regards to quality and reliability. I rarely have issues with calls and video chats dropping and the messaging is superb. The picture quality while using video is very clear and although my family and I are thousands of miles away, with the use of this app we are still able to feel a sense of home. If you’re considering this app, I say give it a try, just make sure the ppl who you are trying to stay in contact with have the app as well and you’re good to go!
It’s an nice app but please Add day, midnight or other theme like telegram does and make the app faster if you can coz it’s kinda getting boring ,thanks
With this app, you can communicate with people in different countries for free. You can create group chats and everything else you could wish for in a messenger app.
The recent IOS update doesn’t let me download the app I had it before but it ask for my Card and it’s really annoying and I truly don’t want to share that information. I know the app is great but due to this IOS update I really don’t know who to ask on solving this issue. Thanks 
My 18 year son, is having amazing adventure in Patagonia. Having this app has giving me peace of mind, and a good nights sleep!! Thx
Love what’s app can’t get a better app
Tanks
the best app
Hello developers, I am wondering, if you guys make update regarding Whatsapp profile visit notification! Like when people visit your profile you will notified! When people watch ur profile picture you will notified, if you guys make this update it will be awesome:) 
Good app but when I say "save to camera roll" and "never" it's annoying that it constantly switches back
Perfect in all ways coolest app
Muy. Buena ayuda. Mucho
I give this App 5 stars not only because it untethers you from SMS and MMS charges but also because it allows a flawless user experience such as consolidating video chat, audio calling, picture messaging, video messaging, audio messaging, location sharing, read receipts, typing status and when the contact is online or the last timestamp of when they last logged in. I truly love how this combines many cluttered apps on our smartphones, into just 1 simple app with a flawless user experience. Did I mention that this app provides encrypted messaging?!   Awesome job WhatsApp! You have my Vote! 
App is great but should incorporate a translator straight into the app.
Been using WhatsApp for the past five years and use it when traveling overseas. If you use it in China you have to use a VPN because the govt doesn’t allow this because of its super encryption. You can make phone calls to other WhatsApp users and encrypted with a product called Signal. Nothing bad to say, very good product.
Thank you!
It has been since past update
Thank you for this aop
برنامج جميل جداً سهل الاستخدام يحتوي على كثير من الميزات وامين جدا شكراً لكم
Good
I love him too
Le podrian agregar que los msj se pueda borrar cualquier momento q uno quiera
We first found WhatsApp when one of my children went to school in Australia for a year.  I was amazed that the texts were transmitted also instantly.  And as my children grew up and moved away from out rural city, being part of a group chat allows up to interact almost, but not quite, as good as if we were all in the same house.  We’ve even had real-time, or near-time runnings jokes and ridiculous selfie-wars.  I also keep close contacted with my family on the individual level.  E.g., I send photos of strange foods to one daughter.  Further, when one of my married children visits with their family, or a few unmarried children come, I can make quick temporary group chats, such as July 2017.  I’m also a member of two groups for the women in my community.  One is just for Announcements.  So much easier than having to call everyone individually or try to keep a telephone-call-chain going.  The other quality about WhaysApp is making long distance audio or video calls for free.  Finally, and very importantly, this app runs circles around the text messaging service that’s already loaded on your phone.  Videos load faster, and I rarely have a problem with the service.  VERY rarely, like maybe twice in 8 years, if that.  The only drawback, if you want to call it that, is that you need to have internet service, and it must be on, to use the app.  For me, it’s worth it a hundredfold. 
Thanks to the creators of WhatsApp. I have gained a lot and I keep gaining. God bless your work.  Austin. 
Very useful and informative. Can learn what is LIFE. 
Please add dark mode for the whatsapp just like Twitter and Telegram!
Estoy decepcionado antes podía hacer y recibir llamadas, escuchar audios al oído y ahora no puedo con un iPhone X! Me podrían ayudar a resolver el problema? Gracias
Using this App too stay in touch with my daughter while she travels around Europe has been great. Even photos come in fast and clear.  I highly recommend this App
One of the best apps that I enjoy
Whatsapp is the bestest social networking site ever in social world  thanks Whatsapp
Please improve on the calls
I lobe whatsapp. But if only there could be a group call.
I have a new iPhone 8, the app will not stay on the Number keyboard and will not allow numbers to be typed in.
I like to use WhatsApp the only think some times it will be clicking going in circles i cant send or receive anything  even i have a very good connection.
The best invention ever.
Perfect
‏ممكن الفيديو أطول وقت على الحالة
Ok‼️
Awesome
What can I do to get the chats I backed up from my android phone?
Add Night Mode
Excelente
I just wish the gif keyboard was more accessible, idk if that's an apple thing of WhatsApp thing. Other than that, great!
Lately my connection has been lacking on this app .. it takes forever for a message to send ..so we miss times to communicate with our time :( please fix this
Thank you
My girlfriend in Germany hit me up to the app and have been using it ever since.
Muy bueno el mejor
I love it 😍, I really enjoy using it!!!
Awesome app to communicate with friends and family !
Love being able to communicate with all our family at the same time 😎
As you call someone and he didn't picked up, the device vibrates when calling process finishes, can you the same when you are calling and he answers the call ?? In this case you will have to cancel the ending vibration, just a question to the developers, this is needed when you call someone and you neglect your phone until they answes but you don't notice that, if you are going to tell me use the handsfree mode, I will tell you this mode is useless when you are having a noisy around place, please consider this in the next update please, thank you
I love it and recommend it a lot
WhatsApp is an amazing app that makes it so I can text my family members that live far away. I have a family member that lives all the way across the world and without WhatsApp I wouldn’t be able to contact her.
How can there be glitch around the new year when someone wants to wish their loved ones a happy new year. Almost ruined my new year.
You are helping people 99% just be muslims and you will go to heaven and u will be 100% thank you ❤️❤️😘😘❤️❤️
Es la aplicación que más uso y cada día es mejor por la cantidad de personas que la usan y su versatilidad
Thank you
A good application with all new improvements.
Back didn’t work as it should . Lost a lot of my contacts
I had to reinstall after I had a phone issue. After reinstalling the app it no longer works. I’m using an iPhone 6 with current software.  What’s the fix for this?
I think that it is too slower than other apps such as telegram ..
Very good but if the status video can be more longer it will be great
notification problem
I am writing this for giving an suggestion which makes application more usable. I want to suggest to an update for group video/audio calling feature which helps a lots of users. Audio/ Video calling feature already in place for individual users. So, only update is to have group call for created group.   User story will be something like this:  As a user, I want to do video/audio call to group of members so that it avoids depending on other applications   Acceptance Criteria: Video/Audio calling feature for created group  Use cases:  1. User can create a group to do Video call 2. User can create a group to do Audio call  Implementation:  - Need to have buttons/Icons for video and audio calling after clicking group details. - Need to have buttons after a clicking a group from main screen for entering some chat. 
Love it 🤗
Love this soooo much!!!
This app is by far the best one I’ve got on my phone.
It's working pretty good.thank you.
Good, couldn’t b cheaper, reliable very helpful , I love it
IT’S THE BEST
Great IMing
When touchid or even pincode willbe added to enter whatsapp?
Eh tenido problemas con mi whatsapp, no puedo hacer llamadas porque no tiene sonido, ni para videollamada ni para nada
No funcionan las llamadas con el iPhone X
Me encanta wathsapp porque me puedo comunicar con todo el mundo por favor like y dale 5 estrellas si logras comunicarte con todo el mundo👌
Very nice application we are connecting with our friends and family
I been having really good luck using it.  Can talk and text with no issues!
This is an amazing service.  You should use it for all international calls.
I don’t have a SIM card yet but what’s up is perfect because you don’t need it you just need WiFi so it’s pretty good I also love what’s up because I can communicate with my family half across the world
Whats wrong with you guys !! Please release an update to fix the bugs . I cant send my messages and recive them !!!😡😡
شكرا لكم
Love WhatsApp! Because of it I can now be constantly connected to my family and friends. Love the international calling option
This is an excellent program/tool to communicate with one person or multiple people in a group. Easy to share pictures, videos and documents. Useful functions that allow one to automatically save pictures or to mute groups. Highly recommended.
Its so boring there is no channels no robots telegram is much better than this
Great to keep in touch with everyone
I just can’t get why most of pple r using this It’s nothing comparing other same appa 
Add rich notifications (reply to messages from lock screen and keep that conversation without opening the app)
This app has changed my life. With it I can communicate with family across the globe. Free phone calls, I told all my family to get it. My 90 year old father love receiving pictures and videos from family & friends through it.
This is a really awesome app that you can use to text and call friends in other countries without a cost. I think the staff did a really good job putting it together. Whatsapp is definitely something you all need to get
Amazing app, I love the no advertising features, well connected with all my school groups, college groups, colleagues, friends and family members. I can’t rate more than 5 stars, that is the limit, I can rate 1000 stars or even more. This is the only social app I use all the times. Thanks for the development efforts and continues improvements.
Súper estupendo gracia a WhatsApp tenemos la oportunidad de hablar con nuestro seré querido para poder darle sonrisa como WhatsApp que no brinda más que una sonrisa porque está con nosotros en cada momento gracias por danos la forma de avanzar en el mundo  WhatsApp  une a la familia en cualquier parte de mundo WhatsApp es la definición de lo que seremos mañana podemos decir que seremos brillante porque a si vemos a WhatsApp gracias por darnos felicidad bendiciones
Best app ever
After 8 years of my cousin living in Guangdong province in China, we both agreed on which service to use. That was easy, as several of my family and friends had been using “What’s App” to make contact seamlessly, and without flaws!   China is a country with several restrictions, including many social media outlets, like Facebook and Twitter. But “What’s App” is not one of them. My first conversation with my cousin was on Christmas. Keep in mind I live in the PNW, and where my cousin is in China he’s 16 hours ahead of me. Normally we’ve been able to chat when it’s 6pm here and it’s 9am the next day in China.   I’m very happy to leave this 5⭐️ Feedback. It’s reconnected my family and I couldn’t be happier. Also note, there are NO hidden costs or fees to use this. There are NO time restrictions; such as a certain time that you must use this app to avoid ant charges. Again, it’s 100% FREE! It’s works with your phone’s internet service, a lot like iPhone’s messenger does. 
Real time connection, thank u for such an helpful app
I had WhatsApp before it became popular!! Love this app... great way to stay in touch with friends and family internationally
This i.m. & video phone service works great for my needs!
Probably another bug. iPhone SE microphone on back camera doesn’t record properly while using WhatsApp. The sound gives off something like a screech. Need a fix from developers.
I have a friend in Panama and it was wonderful being able to share pictures and communicate on here! Can’t go wrong. Mark Agnello
Calls need to be improve but over all is gear app and really necessary
WhatsApp is really working better for me because it does everything ... it makes communication very nice and secure
I use it for calls between U.S. and Israel.  Works well.
Excelente aplicación para estar en contacto con la familia y amigos
خرررى مقاطع الفيديو في الواتس بدون دقايق 😡
.،
Watsup bizim için vazgeçilmez güzel bir program. Ama görsellik konusunda biraz geri kalmış gibi.
Great way to keep connected to friends & Family!! Can’t Beat it! “Sge 69” BX Boggie!
Love this app. Starting using this app because I have an iPhone and part of my family has other devices. When I travel, I wanted a way to “FaceTime” with them. This app allows us to do that. It works everywhere. I used it when traveling in Hong Kong and China. I use it with my international friends from Germany and Romania also.
Yep!
Ok
We all interested in this app but it would be better if some u change the appearance!  Imagine whatsapp with themes :)))  So good 🙃 
App constantly asks to turn on notifications. It is intrusive and annoying.  Also, I would like to have the option of selectively adding people to my list instead of having to block everyone I want off. I have a large contact list with personal, business and other contacts that I do not want to be sharing my info/status. 
Love the app for 2012.   Considering it’s 2018 robust improvement in security, interface and functionality are needed.  I would advocate multi level interactions within groups:-  - Such as being able to mute an individual or individuals - being able to group video (think Skype just not as antiquated) - the app should be more dynamic/magical in is functional/feature feel and options  - integration with other apps may be helpful such as periscope etc  - group management should be a more robust and interactive function and feature 
Cuídense los apreciamos mucho y más!!
Its good app.
C'est une excellente application que j'utilise chaque jour ! Elle facilite ma vie dans mes relations familiale et professionnelle. Elle me permet aussi de nourrir des rapports amicaux cardinaux  !   Félicitations aux décideurs de Whatsaap ! 
L’amour est mystérieux
Well I have found some flaws in the app. First of all no stickers? Really? I mean all the messenger apps have stickers. And second... when you send a photo through the app the quality gets ruined 100%! That’s terrible! You should let the users send their photos without compression. You should add an option for that. Letting the users to delet/edit their messages is necessary too.please see to these problems and whatsapp will be the best messenger app!
Now it’s terrible, so slow, a lot fails I don’t know what else I have to do to haber WhatsApp working good in my IPhone, I’m waiting for an update ASAP to solve this situation
It is also a great pleasure to me to say that whtsapp is the best apps ever used by all nations, so thank you vey much for its teamwork I wish good new year 2018 to you all. Dr. Abdullah Alsharif 
Good app
Excellent communications realized
Real good. Costs less to call then phone and includes FaceTime
Awesome App I like WhatsApp Thanks ..
It crashes every time o try to make video calls or voice calls it work fine on iPhone 7s+ and iPhone 8 but not on iPhone X
Good
No pics
Best app
👍🏽
Love this app it lets me text and call and FaceTime my grandmother who lives in India for free if I was using the normal text it would cost me $20 a week anyway love this definitely recommend!
ععع
I want go WhatsApp for my iPhone
An incredibly valuable tool to communicate with others.
When I want forward message. I can’t see the contacts
Before porting from an Android phone know that Android only backs up to Google drive and iOS only retrieves from iCloud. I lost all my data and it's frustrating that WhatsApp doesn't provide it's own servers for backup across different operating systems.
I haven't been able to open my Whatsapp for five days. This is how I connect with family and friends in other countries. Please fix this as soon as possible.   Happy New Years Eve,  Max Carias (305) 467-4547 
It is pretty good it’s just that sometimes it lags and it gets kinda annoying if that were fixed u would have 5 stars 🤗 thank u
Почему у ватсапе не могу использовать два номера.. это большой минус для вас.. У меня есть два номера домашний и рабочий из-за этого использую два программы для связи.. это не удобно. Думайте об этом.. делайте удобства для нас
Not really sure I understand the point of the app other than being able to FT people with android phones with an iPhone. Other than that it’s just a waste of space.
Es la mejor app de mensajería, quizá no un segura como Telegram o Signal pero definitivamente es la más masiva y práctica.
I like it
One of my favorite communication apps. Reliable. Fast and perfect. 10 stars. Not 5!!!!
You can be better
cayó WhatsApp , como yo cai en sus mentiras 😩
The app has always been reliable for the 2+ years I’ve been using it.  But after recent updates, I noticed sometimes I’ll try sending a message to anyone and the top bar in the messaging section says “Connecting” and my messages never go through for a certain amount of time, anywhere from 10 mins to about 2 hours.  It’s not my connection because my internet works fine for every other messaging app/media app I use. Idk why this happens, but it’s kinda rare, I would say once every 3 weeks or so.
🤬😡
No me sirve no me conecta le doy cinco estrellas ya que en lo que funciona esta bien pero espero y erre Galen mi problema de no conectar
Is there a reason why my app just still says connecting to it? Last night it was working perfectly fine☹️ but when i woke up to check something it just stays on connecting
I’m not sure what is wrong with this app but I keep having bug issues
The app stop working y’all need to fix it
Always have trouble connecting with overseas even with using WiFi connection is not good. Pictures not clear and volume will go in and out
WhatsApp just crashed on me and it does not want to connect anymore while everything else works on the internet. Please fix the issue
The app hasn’t been working at all today. How soon can we assume it’ll be fixed?
I’ve spent the last 2 days trying to backup and restore on a new phone. It keeps on failing, and the whole migration is terrible.  I travel a lot and switch numbers. WhatsApp is always a pain. All other apps migrate without a problem. WhatsApp should have implemented email login years ago.  Very slow innovation... 
İt forcing me out everytime ı won't use it anymore!!!
What the hell! I need to call my family in India and you guys shut whatsapp down exactly at 12 ?! Why!?
It’s been taking a while for the app itself to connect to the internet/WiFi. I’ve closed all apps and still takes a while to load, even restarted the phone and same thing. Idk why but please fix this issue.
RIP WHATSAPP 31.12.2017 NOT WORKING
My only problem is the app gives out the wrong time I see people that was last login
Unable to receive and send messages don’t know what’s wrong with it It’s showing me connecting even though I have both mobile data and WiFi turned on  What going on ????  What’s wrong with it 
The app lags when a new iOS is released! Please fix!
Please open AppStore on iranian, we need it
الواتساب من اجمل وأكثر وسائل التواصل انتشارا وسهولة في الاستخدام وانا اقضي وقتا كثيرا في استخدام الواتساب ولا أستطيع الاستغناء عنه .
Amazing app
Whatsapp is the best in Haiti
Ivam
It’s an amazing app it is very easy to chat with ur baes and anyone I really enjoy it and almost never use iMessage anymore u guys should all download this app
Good new communications tool!
Very good app
Bueno
I have another app, and was content with that app. A friend of mine told me to get WhatsApp, I shrugged off her recommendation until I moved to Europe. WhatsApp is easier and equally powerful. My quest is to get more of my friends to get WhatsApp.
I need themes
Worked absolutely fine until the last update. Now it logs me out and I have to accept terms and conditions multiple times a day and fill in phone number, name etc every time.
Mala señal en las llamadas de video
I have friends all over and use the app to keep in touch. From messaging, video calls  or voice.   We don’t need another barrier with communication the app makes distance not seem important as friendships   Thank you 
Best of the best🤙🏼
Can be a little slow and the video quality tends to be so annoying
For some reason the sound (notifications) isn’t working at all. I get notified but no sound. I have all my stuff ON!!! Need to update again
جيد جداً
I love WhatsApp but I would love if it was compatible with Apple Watch!!!
Es súper cool divertido y es una aplicación súper 😜
I use this app to contact my friends and trust me-It’s amazing!
This is the most important app on my iPhone.
ما استفدنا من خاصية الاسترجاع شي لانه مؤقت اتمنى لو انه يسير دائم مثل برنامج البلاك بيري متى ماشئت استرجعت كل شي والمحادثة بأكملها تسترجع فأي وقت  فيها امان اكثثر    We did not take advantage of the temporary message retrieval feature. If the recovery time is as long as in BlackBerry, I can retrieve all messages whenever  i  want. Thanx .. 
❤️❤️❤️
It can be better  Conchen could be better 
Every time I try to send pictures with a legend the app crashes and I have to start over. And I’m not talking about sending a whole bunch of them, only 6 or 7 pictures are enough to make it crash. Please fix that.
It's a must pretty much everywhere in Latinamerica and many places in Europe! And it also has a desktop and online version. I believe it's the best multiplatform messaging app!
J
Bueno
Es bueno poder llamar y recibir mensajes
App eats your iPhone capacity, even deleting media files or by setting it not to save media on phone . Non responsive when you want to REPLAY a comment by hitting the pic or video , the pop-up window doesn’t show easily.
Much luv WhatsApp
I was trying to open my app but every time I click he just went back to the home screen right I can’t even use it
As you know many countries are poor people and can’t afford to eat and the governments controlling, stealing everything. Having WhatsApp available to everyone is a blessing for a lot of people to communicate with friends and family so I’m personally appreciate who created, worked, to make WhatsApp’s available. Happy new year. Thanks 
the app is taking so much space on my phone memories keep the data on the cloud to make the switching easily on new phone
Let me not get started on how poorly the video quality is, but also the sound is not clear when you’re talking to someone! Please can you fix this? This is a very nice app, but the extra features are not really in good quality
I like WhatsApp because when I talk to my friend in Congo I can see pictures and videos clear. A year or two ago I couldn’t see the pictures or videos CLEAR! Now it is a lot more user friendly in terms of group messaging and sending addresses.

Muy bien
Thank you for an app that allows us to stay in touch with family when traveling abroad  In our crazy world, communication is the best gift!  A mom in Texas 
I like it
Whatsapp is freezing when accessing camera roll to upload a video or many photos. Live status is making the app crashes. Whatsapp says it can upload video up 30MB, but is not true. A 12mb video doesn’t upload entirely.
Wonderful security secured messaging app. Totally recommend!!
BEST APP EVER
Harusnya ada Pesan berwaktu.
I don’t like when my all contacts should see my profile pic on what’s up. I wish I can choose who can be on my list. When you open WhatsApp you don’t have an option of  anybody showing up there.
I have sent 3 emails and not gotten a response.
Very convenient best thing that’s ever happened to families away from families
Excelente app
The app won’t open and says I don’t have enough storage, when all my other messaging, etc. apps work just fine with the current storage level, and at least don’t refuse open. Lame
😍😂😂😂
جميييييل😍
👍🏽 top notch!
Every one
Hi developers! Thank you for always making this app better! Can you please add a feature that allow us to like/love or give reactions on messages using emojis? It will be more fun!  Thank you! 
Please make whatsapp be able to send original size photo

WhatsApp it’s a great app. Thanks to its creators WhatsApp gives people from all walks of life the chance to keep in touch with family and friends around the world. Whether it’s s phone call, video call or just a message call (text), WhatsApp brings you close with loved ones and beyond for no cost at all. What more we can ask for! WhatsApp, keep up the good work! Thank you.
I like the app it’s a great way for my friends and loved ones go communicate. I just wish the app was accesible through my Apple Watch I have to grab my phone to send a message every time. I can reply on my watch but I just can’t initiate a conversation let alone see who else I’ve been texting. If you could please make it an app that you can actually open on the Apple Watch that would be a 5 star rating.
The best app

What’s app is one of the best apps In the world
I chatted with my friend in South America for free it worked great !!
I really really like WhatsApp but the only complaint I have is that in 3 different times I had to delete the application and downloaded again and when I do that I do loose some info (like recent messages, etc). The message I got is that is full and I need to do a recovery of the data or just do a recovery but it never allows me to do the recovery and that's why I need to delete and download.
You need to ring on peoples phones
WhatsApp is saving us as the means of communication with Greek hosts!
I find WhatsApp convenient and most effective in my communication routine, hence use it all the time.  Highly recommend it.
Goodd
Great app needs major bug fixes and increased max video length. Also the reason I rated it 1 star is so they actually see this and fix the problem.
I love it ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Meh
The archived messages can be shown easily, i want something that nobody can see it . I want it more secure. Thanks.
Es la mejor comunicación en la distancia, un abrazo y gracias por esta maravillosa aplicación
I love this app, is just that I love the idea of bringing my chat history from Google Drive wich I can't actualy
باد
WhatsApp is great to connect us all around the world my only glitch is it drops one call for another that you may not even intend to answer. Over all I’m glad whatspp came along. Thank you and peace and blessings for continued joys
هل يمكنني استعادة المحادثات السابقة مع العلم اني عملت تخطي وبعدها لم اجد اي بيانات خاصه بي
if i could set a privicy to my acount picture that everyone i choose can see my picture , watsapp change to a really really good app
where the voice !!
ملاحظتي فقط تحسين جودة الاتصال  شكرا ادارة واتساب 
Wonderful way to stay in touch with family around the world.
Complete trash when it comes to backing up and restoring. I just bought a NEW iPhone 8 with 64 gigs of storage, have 200 gigs of ICloud storage, yet I need to free 7 gigs to restore? HUH? It’s a BRAND NEW phone! The back is only 12 gigs in total and I have over 40 gigs of storage. Doesn’t make sense.
Amazing service ,best for bid sharing, talking texting. Can't go without it!

Been using the app since 2014 when I moved to US. My family lives in Brazil and I can text,video call them for free (on WiFi or LTE connection). When I go visit them I keep my phone on airplane mode and I still can use the app and talk to my friends in the US trough WiFi.  The app works perfect for my necessities and I’m glad the developers keep improving it! 
Awesome! I can talk to my baby on the other side of the earth!!!!
I think WhatsApp should have “like” option like iMessage.
If you can provide an iPad app, it would be awesome. Also can you make this a light weight app. 100Mb for app is lot of storage. There's scope for improvement there. The forcetouch feature to get a quick  glance on how many messages you've from various contacts helps me to decide whether to open the app and respond immediately or not. It saves effort from viewing messages in notif center and understand what's going on.
Whatsapp would be way better if we had the option to do group calls and video calls.
WhatsApp is not the best app I feel there are other better apps but it is kind of ok
WhatsApp es parte de mi que hacer diario para comunicarme con mi familia que vive en el extranjero, así como mis amigos locales que compartimos de todo !!! Tienes la oportunidad de separar a las amistades que no están de acuerdo conmigo. Es una gran herramienta para compartir fotos, videos en tiempo real. Debería existir una opción de "borrar" un contenido cuando se nos escapa de las manos, pero solo dentro del minuto siguiente. En realidad estoy muy contento y creo que deberían realizar encuestas de este tipo con algún tipo de incentivo para que conozcan sus fortalezas y debilidades. Saludos  Jordan Burga 
It's great how you can text, call and even FaceTime anyone anywhere even if they don't have the same phone as you. It's even free!
One of the best app given to us all. We cannot live without it especially to keep in touch with our loved ones in far off land  Thank you Wish your team a Happy New Year 
Love you doing everything to you for everything
This app is awesome. It allows me to talk to my friends overseas for way cheap. A suggestion for this app would be that they should offer an Apple Watch app.

I really like the app, it’s great for messaging; however my calls get reconnected constantly every couple of minutes which is really frustrating

Very good
👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻😂😍😍😍😘😘😘😘
Buenizimo
I’m in the US while my family is in Europe and we are communicating on real time and in an instant. Photos are clear . Texts are accurate . And the graphics are awesome. Seriously you guys- this is a good App
Nice apps, just always drops calls and has failed calls all the time.
Esse app tem todas as funções de comunicação, e o melhor gratuitamente!!!
Good
Stupid app
Whatsapp mute screen recorded video on IPhone 7.
I live in West coast of USA. My families and friends still lives in Malaysia. Haven’t been home since 2008. Thank goodness there’s Whatsapp. Great and convenient way to send text, photos, videos plus phone call. Best of all it’s all free as long using WiFi connection. Thank you for the great privilege.
Awesome app always keeping it to connect with my friends 😎
Excellent
I love this app !!
All in all i like it, i had never used it up until this June & haven’t had a problem with it, but i just would really like if it can be offered in apple watch!
WhatsApp is the best form to comunícate    You can do groups of friends and tock all of the day so is the best and i tock whit my family 
Great app but need it to work with my Apple watch.
Can’t find anyone it’s hid after one message
A very nice app
While WhatsApp functions well for encrypting end-to-end communications, it still fails to keep your communications safe from prying eyes. Here’s the problem: you send a text message to your contact in WhatsApp and switch to another app. While your phone is still unlocked, your child or someone else picks up the phone and opens WhatsApp with full access to your entire history. WhatsApp has no way of requiring a password to access the app when your phone is already unlocked. For this reason, I give it one star. Poor execution when it comes to security.
Não tenho muito do que falar do WhatsApp, mas falta um App para Apple Watch. Assim teremos mais interatividade diretamente do relógio.
This app is great for international communication for when you don’t want to pay for an international phone plan.  As long as you have wifi, you can send a text over WiFi to someone saying you made it safely to your destination.  No more having to find a computer to send email.
It’s quick and easy to use! Great for sharing photos, videos with people and it’s especially good while I travel outside the USA.
My app freeze and close don’t open the app
مشاكل في التنبية
No puedo recibir llamadas ni hacer videollamadas al menos que aveces esté conectado al wifi
This app is very helpful and I love it
Just wish they were compatible with IWatch
I believe we should be able to select which of our contacts are able to see our profile pictures. It would be nice to be able to have that option just like we have it for our status photos or videos that we are able to pick who sees them.
Very nice !!! Love it
I hate whatsapp initially. But I love that I can communicate with my family in Trinidad 🇹🇹. It’s an awesome app and it works well with no bugs . S/c Starrshmoney
Me gusta pero tiene que mejorar por que no el todos los móviles tienes lo mismo y son todo diferente y se pega mucho
يريت يكون ف تحديد للاشخاص لارسال رساله لعده اشخاص  كمان يريت يكون ف تحديد لمسح عده دردشات
This is the best app ever it is used by me most of the time to communicate with friends,family I’m now so connected that it makes me so close to them thank you very much and I hope the best for you and your future .
Lo recomiendo
I write this review with happy tears in my eyes. I haven’t spoken to my father since I last visited Mexico eleven years ago. Last night (Christmas eve) we were able to have a video call for the first time since. I was even able to introduce my dad to his three year old granddaughter.   Thank you for making this reunion possible. I don’t think we’ll ever be out of touch again. ❤️❤️❤️ 
I like it. It always connect pretty fast. Basically as fast as a text as long as connection is good. The calls are pretty decent too compared to skype.
Literally full if creeps and spam. Not worth it. Im downloading it yet AGAIN to try and stop the junk mail. So annoying. 😡
No creo que saquen otra app cómo está! Me encanta...
ممتاز
thank you guys
Realmente es una muy buena idea pero le hacen mas funciones y arreglar los errores que aparecen con cada actualización ademas que los errores en la interfaz y visual cada dia son mas molestos los he probado en equipos de gama alta iPhone 7 , 8 y iPhone X que es donde he tenido la peor experiencia espero solucionen todos los errores pronto
This app is amazing the app give me the opportunity to talk to my friends and family 😍😍 I liked it
السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته اشكركم كثير على مابذلتموه من خدمة ومساعده للتواصل الاجتماعيه بدقه عاليه وتسهيل  وفقكم الله وسدد خطاكم على هذه العمل المبارك 
The video call and normal calls doesn’t work
Una muy buena herramienta!!!
Le doy cuatro estrellas porque no me gusta que aveces se caiga el sistema de WhatsApp
Thank you
More features should be added like app backgrounds to get it more customized and to have a passcode feature as well as more tones to get to choose from
Keep it up..So far the Best..Hands down.!!
برنامج جميل جدا تواصل به الانسانية جمعا.
I am over joy for this app. It connects to family and friends. Love it love it. 100%.
Don't use it frequently but enough like what I use it for.
Some times the voice not clear
Resolution is choppy and both parties are running 75 & 100bpm internet speed.
Whatsapp is a great way for communicating around the globe but,some tiny changes womt make a difference I believe.To start Whatsapp was updated recently and I noticed that some features were gone.Those features were deleting messages and more.Im giving a 2 star review is because I thinh Whatsapp is capable of satisfying all of its users and please the 30sec is becoming a little to small it should be updated to a 60sec I guess. Thanks 
I have friends all over the world and it’s so nice to be able talk to them for free.
Excellent service! Better call opportunities. Wonderful Sms conversation platform.
2018 and still not free to pick up any phone I want without losing my data?
One day I was talking to my friend on phone and signal was hell lot disturbing.. so what I did was to turn the call down and made what’s app call saying wazup.. it was lucid..
I would love if you guys created the app with fingerprint recognition for security .
No option to remove Online status. Any of your contacts will be aware if you are using the platform indiscriminately. Whether it is business or family or friends you should have the choice who sees you chatting with someone else.
The best app to text,talk and share pictures/videos. Downloaded you will enjoy it. 
This is such an amazing way to contact ppl around the world and do it without using ur data except when u send pictures but this is so amazing and way better then regular messaging don’t think twice about getting this app it’s a no brainer!
This app is awesome.
Nice appp
I can send much more data than in a regular email
Is happening..👍🏼
Connection use to be better.
El servicio muy bueno
Good app to chat
Good
Great to have when we’re away.
Telegram does a way better job at backing up messages. I change my device every now and then. And my old messages are just gone. Hail Telegram 😒
Whatsapp is a generally awesome app but since the new apple update whenever i video call my mic stops working if i make a regular whats app call it works so there is a bug somewhere that needs some fixing thank u
Class
So got new phone back up my phone to the old chats and came they back up have boyfriends in Africa this way talk him everyone voice notes send me u find fix it not a good review..😡😡
Fix the photo save to camera roll problem. Since a recent update, if keeps downloading pics and saving them to my iPhone. The feature is off but it keeps doing it. Fix it!!
This is my only complaint !
رهيب 😍😍😍😍😍❤️💁🏻‍♀️
Very much useful especially for Orthopedics  surgeons.
Speaker doesn’t work during a call, please have a look into this
I have the iPhone X And every time that I want to make a voice call or video call Don’t work if you can help me please Everything works is just the calls. 
Merci
Tengo problemas! Con mi iPhone 7 no me aparecen los nuevos emoticones! Y tengo la nueva versión del WhatsApp y os
If you have an iPhone X, forget about WhatsApp. You can not make calls and barely send or receive voice ou video messages.  I am absolutely frustrated!  Top iPhone and an horrible App 
Pretty good app
I couldn’t have lasted 4 1/2 months and kept my sanity w/o this connection to family 8,000 miles away !
Keeps crashing when emoji keyboard is opened
This is Robert this website is cool 😎
Me encanta
Correct the answer is yes I’m going to be there for generally long time to get $600,000 dollars per week or two more days off next year or so much better if you have to come over later on this week coming up to this weekend or day and night
No se oye nada!!! El modelo es iPhone 8 Plus
Good
Je trouve que en Afrique le réseau est moins fiable
I love Whatsapp. My only regret is that you cannot passcode protect chats like you can with Viber. Please add that feature! There are other apps out there that provide a workaround, but it would be better if passcode protection was integrated.
Very satisfied with it app
I was using group me for business then switched to an encrypted Whatsapp and haven't been happier and ore secure.
Very slow with connection
I use it for communication with family in Europe.
Great application. Used to track the field public information officer’s. Was an outstanding application.
What's App is the BEST!!
Love WhatsApp!  I bought something else and it doesn’t even compare.  Don’t even use that other app.  Keep up the great work!!

Excelente aplicación para comunicarnos de manera rápida y oportuna
تطبيق رائع جداً
Once upon a time, if you’re happy!! You will like this app Sorry for the exclamation marks, be well Great 
Note to self: Remember to watch “friends” who tell you how great this particular app is, they have ulterior motives!  😇😈 All in all this is handy to connect with long distance friends.
Esta merda fica apagando minhas conversas toda hora seus escrotos consertem essa palhaçada quero tudo de volta
يحتاج تعديلا أكثر وتطويل مده حذف الرسائل إلى 24 ساعة
This update is cuting off when i send pictures and in video chats it shuts down the app why 😪😪😪
Please make it work properly with the iPhone X
Helps me send better and longer quality videos then my I phone
It's another app that you talk to your friends too!!!!
Love It Badddd
يارب رضاك والجنه
so easy and fun to use
I have been using this app. For about a year now, and highly recommend.  Easy and economical for anyone on a budget.
Nobody can doubt about how amazing this application to keep in touch with family and friends.
💗 it as 🍎 ft for driod  🔥 🔥 
Terrible app on iPhone X. Please we need an upgrade very soon. I can not receive calls.
اتباتبت
سريعه
Use it to communicate with study and work groups... don't know how we did it without.
Es parte importante en la comunicación entre los seres queridos
Bueno
ممتاز برنامج مجمع الحبايب
i love it
Can't download it
I enjoying using this app to communicate with family and friends whether locally or in different countries and all for free! Thank you for this wonderful app! 👍🏼
Es muy útil
Very choppy
Please bring back the option to hide who sends you a message and whats written in the preview on the lock screen on the iphone x
Great App. Does a wonderful service.
Love this app - it’s almost perfect!   But since I mostly use the Voice Recording feature - it has a couple of major flaws that are very frustrating!  1) If you tap to another screen inside WhatApp while recording a voice message, it immediately deletes it!   Solution: Since you never leave the app while recording, this is something WhatsApp should have control over, to fix it by either allowing it to continue recording, or at minimum have a pop up screen that warns you “Are you sure? Continuing will delete your current recoding.”  2) If the phone rings while recording a voice message WhatsApp kills and deletes the voice message and it is gone!  I lost a very important 12 minute message this way. 😩  Solution: Again, it could have a warning pop up, or just go ahead and save it. Crazy thing is - my friend has an Android, and when someone calls her in the middle of a voice recording, WhatsApp saves it. So why can’t they code the same feature into iPhones? 
We chat is better
Excelente Service
WhatsApp reduce the iPhone brightness in a video calling , every time when I do o receive a video calling the brightness of my iPhone go to darkness, I got a new iPhone 6S Plus and it’s happening in all iPhones besides all the video calling ringtone it’s terrible and can’t answer it from the lock screen. Please take a note of that
I love this amazing app .. great to communicate with others around the world
أفضل برنامج للمحادثات
It’s the best service ever
احلى برنامج للتواصل
Nbooob
I really like WhatsApp because it is not like messages and you can call easy text easy and you can use the voice note easy I really like how they put the messages in the green boxes and I like how the noise when it sends because messages doesn’t have that so you know it sends and it’s just much easier I like it much better then messages
Cannot swipe from chat to chats screen on iphone x
Guys please fix the video can’t be sent
The app WhatsApp is working perfectly👌.
Wish you would offer delete sent messages. We all send things and wish to take I back at times.
AWESOME!!!
I haven't had any issues so far and I love connecting with my international friends using this app!! Makes things so much easier
الجشعم
It doesn't work at iPhone 5 at all.
The platform is super user friendly
مرحباً انه علي من العراق ان البرنامج الاواتساب جداً منتاز وينقصهُ شيء واحد هو المجموعه عندمه ترسل رساله في المجموعه لا اعرف اي احد قد قدرها وانتما ان تعالجون  في تحديث القادم وشكراً
I expected a IM type of app.  This requires access to your contacts in your phone.  You cannot chat with anyone that is not already a contact in your phone and you’ve given access too WhatsApp.  All I wanted was an IM type of app that this is basically the same as sending a text message.
Lastima que aún no tenga seguridad de huellas y mejor la calidad de almacenamiento.
Cool
Awesome
I love WhatsApp for a few of its features. It’s definitely the best option for group chat. But I would really love it if it had better search options through chats for my phone. The desktop app works well for this, but it’s annoying to have to get on my computer to find a link that was sent deeper in chat history. Thanks for the good work on everything else though!
ES FABULOSO ESTAR EN CONTACTO CON TODOS MIS FAMILIARES Y AMIGOS
I just upgraded to an iPhone 8+. Every time I send or receive a text there is a delay. It’s almost as if it’s stuttering. It is quite annoying, is there a fix for this? I have already deleted and reinstalled the app twice. It has done nothing.
It’s very mobile, allows international connectivity.
This is useful app, thanks WhatsApp 👍🏼
This has been an absolutely gem when it comes to communicating for free during international travel. Texting, talking on the phone, or sending photos  while we use various WiFi sources, has saved us so much money on SIM cards. What a wonderful resource: thank-you for creating it.
I think it might be a better app if you add a game section and you could play with friends
Can you please, Please, PLEASEEEE add a checkpoint so that approval is needed by me before I’m added to chat groups? I’m being tortured by endless idiotic messages.
Muy importante en mi desempeño diario
Good luck
1. Being able to ignore groups or people. Even though you archive them, once they write, it shows up on your chat.  2. Being able to pin the people or group you want on top on the chat area.  3. Being able to leave a group without others noticing. 
Add me on Instagram and Snapchat
The best App
Please let me pin more than 3 threads. I run a small business and like to keep my orders pinned to the top of my chats.   Also please add an edit message option like Skype has. I want to be able to fix typos after I’ve sent a message.   And can the delete message thing be clearer?? If I delete a sent message, I feel like it’s only disappearing for me but not for the receiver. 
If it wasn’t for wasup, I’d be in trouble, my daughters iPhone messages are not working, but wasup came to the rescue
He reportado un error desde hace muchoooo tiempo y no dan una respuesta efectiva y la app continúa con error más allá de que fue comprada para iPhone por AppStore
Unlike other programs; Telegram, for example, chats are encrypted with end-to-end by default.
Esta versión es muy intuitiva y súper fácil de manejar
Please do a Dark/Night Mode option... easier for the eyes
WhatsApp is one of fast and best internet communicator for chat, talk, video and messages. “Don’t say I send message “ now Say “I just Whatsapp you” . I give all stars to this app and for the founder and team who build this App 
For me it is the best app that Was created!! But please do more one revision to repair one error !!! If I chose not store no one photo, video, etc in My phone, why in this last version update anything that appeared goes to My camera ???? All configuration on My whats is NO !!! But Goes on My camera, please repair this, ok ?!? I love só Much whats up 💕
I love it so much more than Facebook Messenger because it is so easily assessable and I am more apt to respond right away.  I love it!!!!
Super
It’s the best media of COMMUNICATION!
Me encanta porqué recibo bien a tiempo mis mensajes y puedo estar en contacto con mi familia 😁
Really handy this apps
جميل جدًّا روعه
Please fix the issue of the free calling service,some people still dont have this feature yet, plz update it asap. What the hell happened to apple watch support, i cant get anymore notification on my apple watch???  Fix this issue now plz 
Love this app
How can I change the ring on calls on this app?
Amazing app
Please look at telegram and see what this has and your app doesn't
No quiere abrir la aplicación

باقي فقط ان يجعلو لآدمن القروب الحق في اصمات
Love this app. It allows me to send pics & videos from iPhone to Samsung phones with perfect clarity!!!
Having voice call issues! Keeps disconnecting or reconnecting while im on a call with someone! Please fix!!
Texting is great. The calls are horrible. You speak there is a 5-10 second delay from when the other person hears you.
Fak the forced updates. Switching to telegram
I sent 3 messages.. they were all delivered with 2 checks on each message. They were not viewed.. no blue check marks...  I tired to delete them.. and it only states “delete for me”. Why can’t I delete these 3 messages if they haven’t been view by them?? 
Whatsapp group chat has no one bit of “PRIVACY” at all, I have been continuosly harrased and insulted in group chat, When i mute the group chat and hide it in archieve, It is not completely gone, The next morning i open my whatsapps, I can still see the harassing group chat on me is at the first page of my whatsapps,   What is the purpose of archieve anyway? Hide a chat and it will instantly be unarchieve when someone chat on it?  I have blacklist those number, trying by all means to not look at their chat, but they are still able to chat me in group, i deleted the group, and they r still able to add me back which i have no idea how, probAbly using other number.  I have complain this matter to WHatsapp support that their terms and condition has been breach, but guess what? No “f” given. Not even one reply to mail in a month or more.  So i had it enough and put it in this review instead, whether whatsap would block review or not, this is what happen to me just as mention above, i have been harrased. Keep avoiding this one day, someone gona get their first blood and i meant it. 
The best app for chatting
I think what’s app is an amazing app because you can call FaceTime and text on it write now I am in a different country and I can still text my friends if I did not have what’s app than messages would be charging me money for every text I send so I am glad I have what’s app 1 out of 10 I would give it a million that is how Gould it is if you are reading this I think you should definitely get what’s app plus it is free so that is great to oh and your stadis don’t even get me started you get to design your own words pick a cooler take a picture and make it colerfull and send it to your friends over all I think what’s app should be on everyone’s phone
جيد
Please can we have some User interface updates????? This app is so outdated needs a new look and feel. Can we also have an Apple Watch app? Please?
Esta genial
This app is crap. All I get is spam, even after I deleted it.
لايوجد لدي الموقع المباشر بالواتس اب من خلال ارسال الموقع لأي شخص.
شكرا واتس اب ونتمنى منكم اضافة خدمة معرفة من يقرأ الحالة ومن يتابع الحساب واتس اب ليعرف انك متصل او غير متصل كذلك ربط حالة الواتس بالسناب مع زيادة دقائق حالة الواتس او اضافة الفلم المرسل كامل بتقطيعه من قبل خدمة الواتس ولكم التحيات
Amazing
Súper útil excelente
Is there a way to like comments?
Muy buena
فد شي بشده
Opening a video freezes the app for about a minute and sometimes forever ..who ever is working on loading videos should be fired.
This is by far one of the best social media app i’ve been using for a while.. really love this app...
Just love being able to easily send data (pics, texts, and videos) via my cell phone to my family overseas.
El WhatsApp se friza y se cierra el solo al cargar las fotografías. Que está pasando? Siento que WhatsApp está bajando la calidad... utilizo un iPhone y lo único que me falla es esta app. Por favor envíen actualización pronto con esos problemas resueltos!
When we add pic to the status the quality of the pic is totally changing to worse
كل ما يحويه برنامج الواتس آب رائع ،، فقط يحتاج لبعض التعديلات الفنية في النظام العام للبرنامج 
Please update for iphone x (10) I can’t make a audio call, NEED UPDATE ASAP PLEEEEEEEEASE
Works great for keeping in contact with all my friends!
It's an app that ends up weighing 2 gb needlessly, they say to delete content from the chats, but that doesn't work, because even if you do it won't give the total amount spent. They should add a tool to optimize the app and delete the cache or junk files that make it so absurdly large.
Not sure what happened to the broadcasts lists, but it’s no longer there for iPhone. Also, if you choose to add a contact, once you are finished the contact will not show up in your WhatsApp contact list, so that is completely worthless as well. You are stuck with only group chats with only people using WhatsApp. So dumb.
Tengo problema con WhatsApp en mi iPhone X no quiere salir las llamadas ni entran ni las videollamadas quiere funcionar
This is a great and easy app to use
I am now able to  connect with my overseas family... thank you for creating a way for the global citizens to connect and share love and peace.
I just love using this app. It's one of the first apps I have to download on my phone if it was resettled to its original settings. I'm able to communicate with everyone around the world and share memories with them 🤗 I just love it!
Lo máximo
Using this app is dead simple, and not the encryption is a fantastic add on.
Naturally Plus USA  IZUMIO Hydrogenized water 
En esta nueva actualización, los chats para even bloqueados x unos instantes, no actualiza ni la propia foto de perfil, ni la de los demás
This is the best app to do anything on any device
Just Love ❤️ it!!
Is there a way to print my WhatsApp call history and a chat including shared images. I tried printing the chat with images but it didn’t work. It was separated. Is there a way to get the chat and shared images on one document?
Personally, my favorite social media app. Yet I have one problem, it may just be me, but for 1-2 years now I have been unable to send smileys like the following: *~* ; *_* ; *-* as an example. When I send these, the person that receives them, receives them like this:  ~ ; _ ; - ... Not important but just thought I’d let the developers know. 
I think we need help
Please, I want to know why some phones have more variety of emojis in the keyboard. I used to have an LG 4 & nowI have an iPhone 7; the keyboard changed & it has less than the half of the emoji keyboard on the LG. Is this something related with the phone model or WA?  I also have friends who have iPhone 7 plus or other iPhones & they have a extended keyboard. 
Great features and efficient!!
I like WhatsApp, the only thing is when you click backup, and change cellphones the backup is gone. On some android phones you don’t have options to not save downloads in groups.. and calls don’t connect right.
Love it
There’s an issue that makes the app inactive right after typing a message and hitting the back button.
Awesome to stay connected with friends and Family
This app helps the world to communicate bypassing the major telecommunications cooperation that charges and make you feel as enslaves, due to monopolization . Thanks for this app 
With every update the app works smoothly.
Love it
Whatsapp is crashing on iPhone 5 iOS 10.2.1 with whatsapp version 2.17.82.   Please fix this bug asap. 
A must have app!
Simply can’t connect calls
App all ways says call failed
WhatsApp is the best way to keep up with far far away relatives. Love it!!!
عمل خاصية للإرسال لاحقا ، بمعنى أنك تكتب رسالة ولكن لا ترسلها مباشرة بل تعمل لها إرسال لاحقا وتحدد اليوم والساعة الذي ترسل فيه هذه الرسالة
Best messaging app, fast, free, easy with pics, everyone is on !
I does love dis app. It is loads of fun. We use it to look at our grand buds. Berry nice.
Awesomeness
They need to create a way to search others by their number even if they are not in your contact list other wise it’s a cool app to use
Video call receiving work flow is not convenient. Where as audio call can be received very well in full screen and on lock screen. Please fix the video call receiving same as audio call receiving flow in iPhone iOS 11.  The incoming call will continuously rings even though we mute the call on lock screen. Incoming call flow need to be fixed in iPhone iOS 11. 
Very confusing to add contacts.
great app to text your friends and family espically if u dont have any wifi😁😄😃😀
I am on a 6s and since the last update from this date of me posting this review this update of WhatsApp has slowed down on me on numerous occasions. The keyboard begins to slow down and WhatsApp in general slows down and only WhatsApp then when I restart my phone WhatsApp works smoothly once again. Don’t know what’s causing this but only happens since the last update.
Great great great
WhatsApp keeps me in touch with my family and friends around the world
I love this app
I call my family overseas and is great.
Dear whatsapp team, I would like to give a suggestion to you about the status update. Kindly allow the users to upload the audio files (mp3) also along with images and videos. 
I’m Having an issue & no help from Whatsapp
Not happy changed phones and all my history erased from previous chats and photos👎.
My extended family lives on three different continents. This is how we stay connected!
When someone tries to add me to group i should recieve invitation then it's up to me to accept it or not. I got bothered by those who force you to join the group whiteout my agreement.  Also give us the option to control voice calling. There should be optional switch to off voice calling.   Give us or privacy and let us to control our app and decision.  Also deleting is really annoying and bothers me by forcing us to do it one by one.  Add a force to the group manager to show the "red card" or "yellow card" to those who did wrong attitude in the group like but them on side hanging for 12 hours or 24 hour or more. 
Everytime someone calls me via whats app it doesn’t cancel out my music so there will be a song playing in the background while I’m on the phone call making it difficult to hear the other person.
It’s amazing how What’s app has changed our world. Now people across the globe can connect instantly thanks to this free internet service.
Es muy bueno
nice app
I noticed that when I attempt to search for contacts using the letters on the right hand side it only jumps to names beginning with C and then doesn’t work. I find myself having to scroll through the name. Good thing I don’t have much friends whose name begin with Z
The app has updated from the past to present and now I love it it’s like a second phone thanks so much I can reach relatives and friends that have the app without fear!!
Muy bueno
טוב מעוד יש לשפר את הירות והכול ‏טוב
I lost all my texts when I updated my phone to the new iOS knowing im still using the same number, i hope you fix this issue in the future to make everyone not lose their data,,, thanks.
I can’t hear the other caller. The audio conversation now sounds like walkie talkie. The other caller has to wait to speak, when they speak they will have to speak so loud so that what’s up can pick his/her voice.   I don’t get calls notifications nor message. Please fix. The last update seemed to be the problem. 
So happy with this new app able to talk to my cousin Israel see his face to most fantastic thing ever happened thank you joy your day joy your holidayShaloam
I’ve had this bug for 1 year now I’d thought you would fix it but I guess not .everytime I play a voice message the screen goes black and it stops the message , I literally can’t play any voice message.hope you fix it soon.
‏أتمنى من علامة المتصل تكون مخفية
Siri integration leaves a lot to be desired. She can't figure out I that want to send a message to an individual if it sees that individual in multiple groups, no matter how many times I say the individual's name when asked "which one". Also, there's no Apple Car Play app.
Confusing
Love it
Its simply the best: It heats cellphones but makes life easier. Great app!
Simple  Free Everything you need nothing you don’t 
Still fake profiles and scammers and people as with all date sites
When I’m typing the keyboard lags in a way that in other apps doesn’t happen and when I tell Siri to send a message to x person she’ll say “WhatsApp didn’t find the contact of x who do you want to send it to” and that is so annoying please fix it. Oh and please remove the camera icon from the bar you can upload an status in the status tab so please bring back the contacts option
The best!
My friends complain that Facebook Messenger is unstable but when we use WhatsApp, much more stable.
Works great use it all the the time. I do get the notification on my watch and I can answer from my watch but I can’t really open up my messages from my watch.
App says to allow access to mic, there is nowhere to do that, app already allowed each option available, what’s that ???
Great place to cyber and chat with close friend
Wow
The app is perfect but can we give people permission to be added to group chats. It’s ridiculous how you wake up to over 5k messages from unknown people. Please look into that. Let’s have a right to be or not be in group chats.
I love this app more than texting regular and snap
Better than before
Awesome app I would recommend.!!!!
La mejor aplicación para estar en constante comunicación con mi familia y seres queridos 😍
WhatsApp should change their address book collection policy! Instead of uploading all contact information to their servers (including names, phone numbers, emails, physical addresses, birthdays, and other contacts related information), if a user gives access only the phone numbers and name should be accessed on device only, and NOT uploaded to Facebook servers!
I can’t make Whatsapp calls on my iPhone X. I have tried to delete the app and reinstall it, but it didn’t work. I tried to return my phone to factory settings, but it also didn’t work out.   For your kind help and feedback 
الطيب ابن الطيب
Dears  i have a question and in the same time of improving Archived masaages. Whatsapp is a great app till now and it saved a lot of money and connected beloved ones with each other no matter how far they are. I was just woundering if i am archiving something cant it stay in the archive eventhough that the person is still sending massages, and that the only way to see them is through archieve and not in the main page? Cant you make something that we can sort people like a in mail junk or spam and the only way that we can see their massages is through their?? 
حقيقة برنامج اكثر من رائع    تحياتي على القائمين علية
When u are video calling and turn the camera around it disconnects the call, this happened after last update and this same bug was introduced with different updates two more times just this year!!! How hard is it to resolve something n make sure u don’t break it again
Hello
Just don’t know how to add a new contact to my WhatsApp list.
It do not have any apple watch apps yet.
Excellent app, the service you offer is amazing
This app is great! I call my boyfriend that lives 4,000 miles away in a different country and it works just like FaceTime! Never had a problem with it besides it freezing and not being able to see his face once in a while. Other then that best app I have downloaded on my iPhone!
Great app, however, needs to expand privacy options. Such as read receipts- should be able to exclude for certain contacts , instead of  the broad choices of everyone, contacts only, no one. -also the “live “ should have this as well- the ability to exclude certain contacts. right now your only option is to  block a person which is to drastic.
Love this app❤️
Great app. I only gave 4 stars because it auto-lowers volume to whomever your calling upon reception of audio. Which means everything has to be silent in the background. I know, it’s infuriating and retarded, and nonsensical- but it’s helpful because........ (cricket noises).  Otherwise AWESOME APP 
The BEST of the BEST social media app...
After speaking with my son whose in Asia, thru this app, we’re in the United States he sounded like he was right next door, we have sent pictures communicated and text as well and everything has been great!
Lo mejor
Tank you very much WATSAP
You can’t save all images sent to you in an album only 5 at a time not to mention WhatsApp completely destroys the quality of the image you are sharing.
One of the best apps in this world
Why not have emoji's suggested to you as you are typing?
Being a android user I found the following features missing on IOS version of WhatsApp 1. Quick reply by message for a watsapp call is Missing 2. Completely muted groups still show notifications on the home screen, which makes the user get confused over an important message. 
VERY NICE APP
Guess ISIS likes it cuz it’s untraceable, but I think Kik is better, easier to use, easier to manage. Just sayin’
Nigfc
Nos permite reencontrarnos con familiares y amigos en todo el mundo!!!
This app works s great source of communication. Fast, clear, and easy to use. We can talk with the whole family and would. Love the it
شكرا واتس اب
do nada meu WhatsApp parou, apagou e perdi tudo. Mesmo com o backup que eu tinha antes
Crashes when taking photos
Me gusta,es muy útil, practico y lo valoro al máximo 👍👏👏👏Felicitó su gestión
Good app love using it n it’s free to communicate international with family and friends.
Delete chating is too bad make it ezee more than this.  Calling is too bad 
It’s a really good app but it does have some minor problems. Like at times the speaker button won’t work but i would definitely recommend this app. Great connection!!
Me haces feliz, y se que a millones de usuarios también GRACIAS POR EXISTIR!!
Since my dear family add me to this app, we have a family group and has being an amazing way to be together even that we are far away at different places!! Love it!!
Love the excellent reliable communications—all modes—and especially to relatives in Europe.
Whenever I have my headphones I can’t hear any voice note
Hasta ahora no sabía que fácil es usar WhatsApp!
I want to be able to put a code on my whatsapp so that if someone borrows my phone I know he doesn’t have access to all my conversations
That was not completely because of that not feeling of Beedai I think she not recovered mind!!!?
Excellent app
phone calls are terrible
I’m very grateful to WhatsApp for providing great communication service.
Good app is good
It is awesome! It just takes blurry photos. That's the only problem.😛
Love Spending Time in Whatsapp
I used this app a lot more before the last update. Before, I was able to access my whatsapp contacts and favorites within the app, now those options are gone.  Get them back and I will give your stars back.
App is great for cross platform messaging or even cross country messaging.   However, there is a bug in either the phone or the app. I’ve got an iPhone 6s with iOS 11.2 and often, while in a video call, when I go to move the video call to open maybe the messaging or another app. The call will disappear completely off the screen!! With No way to recover it. Screen orientation doesn’t make a difference. Sometimes a simple accidental touch sends the call flying off screen. Please investigate this!!! 
Superb
Loving everything about it but I want the emojis to come live to make it more interesting
I am unable to receive notification sometimes on my iphone 6 plus untill opening the app.
I don't like the idea that if I turn off the setting that allows people to see when I was last online, I won't be able to see when they were last online. Then the setting is pointless.  NEEDS AN UPDATE 🛑🛑🛑
I have waited and tried to work for resolution to issues encountered, and to no avail.  To make it worse to get harassed and barred from using my own personal devices that I pay for, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH ALREADY!!!  I should not have to wait another minute especially when people use the situation as comedy???  I’m sorry NOT TODAY! Support should be reaching out with Experts to at least set an ETA for resolution.
My son is stationed overseas and asked to start using WhatsApp for texting - works fantastically !
the new update left whatsapp horrible !! the keyboard has crashed frequently and we are forced to restart the app, and even after reopening it it stays with a white screen for a while and sometimes refuses to forward messages or send photos into the conversation. ps: it's not a cell issue because my other talk app is normal.
One would think that a great app such as WhatsApp allows you to selectively delete or even restore one or multiple messages at a time; this would greatly improve the way one manage messages.

👍👍👍👏👏👏the best  Without you our life it no longer dad any meaning  Thanks god

hello whatsapp very good but take the photo and video send for freinds not good and take in program send fuzzy 
This is the best messages app there is, look no further I️ have been using it for years, no substitute!!!
This messenger service is a great tech tool to reach out and keep in touch with friends family & loved ones near and abroad ... I highly recommend this app for your daily use as an instant messenger!
Great
Please keep an option to keep starred messages when we do “clear all chat” option. This will help customers to keep their important/useful data alive.
Se "optimiza" mucho y me borra los chats bien seguido🙄🤧
The best app ever I loved
Me encanta!!!!
I find it easy to use. Thank you.
Très bon 👍🏾
It is the best app for immediately communication
For past 2 week the app keep asking for phone number. Every time I open WhatsApp it takes me thru agreement page then ask me to enter phone number. Why do I need to do this daily and almost every time I access the app.
Why does anyone use this app???
Hi Excellent app to communicate. Thanks  Nabil 
Can’t delete some messages
It's lovely
Hi Please make an app for ipad with same features. The exist ipad app for Whatsapp are no good: slow , non useful as iphone version PLEASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSEEEEEEE 💐

Please give the admin option to control the group  by deleting any comments or anything  inside the group.
U guys are awesome
Nice
Excellent . One problem I am in able to ad one friend number to what’s app he is in what’s app also . I trued every thing do not work , I can not see him in WhatsApp
Bad service do NOT get. You can not hear the person you are calling whatsoever. My dad is in Jamaica so we got this app so we could talk. We can’t even talk because of this app!!!
مشكلة كبيرة في المكالمات الصوتية
excellent!!!!
The iPhone app works great but not having an official iPad friendly app in this day and age is simply inexcusable.
Since I get iPhone X I can’t connect WhatsApp calls, if someone one can help me? Thanks
Cool for chat, pics and video
Video calls are whithout ring tones And It's hard to call the sound of the video with the new update And  I want Previous chats in previous whatsapp 
I just wish that u could not have to save all the images on Android too
Me gusta wasapp
Please increase group chat size !!!!!!!
My mic doesn’t work in video call please help me 🙏🏻
I have been using WhatsApp for more than three years now. Not only do I enjoy the fact that all of the phone calls are free, so are the sharing of photos and videos. Last last year they also added a “FaceTime” like application. Another wonderful part is how easy it is to send pictures and videos as long as 3 to 4 minutes without having to cut them. I also like that you can see when people have checked your messages or whether they are online. You can adjust the privacy of course but it’s nice to know. It is also easy to create group chats. Which is great for school and group mom chats for example where you will be able to send birthday photos or videos between each other. Although i live in the United States, I rarely use iMessage anymore. I strongly recommend this app. Also especially if you have family or friends who live abroad....
Love it
My WhatsApp isn’t letting me call anyone. It says unavailable for everything and that person calls me perfectly but I️ can’t call anyone!! Please fix
Algo desagradable por investigación a la privacidad
Good app
Me encanto
I like the button on top instead of the bottom 🙃
My calls aren’t working
It is really good to be able to communicate with my son. We have a bit better luck with the texting than with talking. But this app is great.
que nome esta trabajando
This app allows me to communicate with my family in Haiti and panama voice message video calls and simple sms text....grateful
I live for this app
What’s the use of having a delete feature, if you still tell the other user I deleted something and so ten hours later they wake up and ask “What did you delete?” And I have to come up with an explanation...... Simple Logic developers, delete is delete and not a trace left ..... Fix It .....
But I have a problem .. u updated all the Emojis . But I am not getting that emoji.In my Samsung phone the new emojis are there . But in this iPhone it is not coming . Can u say what is the reason . Pls . I need a reply .
بيعلق البرنامج على غير العادة اتمنى معالجة هذا الأشكال وشكرا
En las llamadas internacionales se caen las llamadas al contestar las llamas , no pasaban anteriormente
واتس اب جميل للغاية برنامج في غاية الروعة
Best texting app out there.
I wish if you could please work on sorting of messages let say group messages by names when looking for old messages  I thank you 
The usage of this app are limitless, it’s a life saver, money saver and more importantly it shrunk our world small through rapid and effective communication. Not too mention the privacy and security that are guaranteed. Great app can’t wait to see what it does next.
Please make an Apple Watch app for Whatsapp. I think it's past time. We really need it.
Hope to see broadcast like the group when we want to forward the message plus we can copy not forwarding the voice message too.Thanks
I really enjoy the fact that you have a reply feature so that there is no question as to which text messages you are referring too.
Love this app. But last few days my messages Don’t go through or when I’m speaking to someone it only shows one check mark and when they no longer want to wait and sign off then it sends. Please check this thank you
The app is clumsy it’s hard to add contacts but most of all the pictures download to your phone and go in the photo library
The worse app for listen to audio messages too deficient!!!!!
Great
I think it's a pretty good app for texting and well worth your time! IMO I don't think that it's the best app for texting that I've ever used.
Whatsapp is greay for communication but there is one thing I think that you guys should add to the app and it’s three way calling there should be the option to call more than one person at the same time,  that will be such a great idea since sometimes you have to talk to more than one person at a time and you can text them, also it will be great if you could make group calls
Keeps you in touch for sure  Thank you Happy Holidays 
للأسف لا يحتوي على مكالمة فديو ... تحياتي لكم
Thanks
I have a problem with video call 😭😭😭 It doesn’t open. 
The call drops several times.
Te invito a que lo pruebes y lo vas a descubrir..
I love the new video calling so much better than kik Kik has drama and I never liked kik anyways  On kik u can't call international without charges plus some of my international friends don't use kik soo ;/ but it deserves 3 stars because most of the times it won't send things even know there's nothing wrong with people's internet please do an update and fix it thanks luvs💋 
En mi iphone x no trabaja bien
Whatsup is a part in my life. Not only entertainment but also knowledge we r getting entire family
Millions of people including me are blessed with the help of WhatsApp,be it audio call or video call and chatting is far superior than any other app, and cost? nothing!! this is where real blessing surfaces.Relatives thousands of miles away,or son or daughter stuck up at some remote airport you are in touch with them. The most important App on the earth. I call it the king of App.
A valuable social network tool  great international text and voice 
بوركتم
Excelente herramienta de comunicación inclusive hay veces que las llamadas son mas estables que del servicio de la compañía telefónica...
Can you please make the delete for every one option apply to the whole chat and it only deletes your part of conversation from the whole chat
It is very fun
This app forces you to download pics, files and videos. There is no way to view these within app without having to save on your phone.
I was in Germany and a lot of people had this app. I downloaded it and never looked back , great for communicating.
Me encanta
Love this app to be connected with dear friends in Italy!!!
برنامج تواصل ممتاز
Manques d’intimité. Ça devrait être plus indépendant du genre plus personnel . 
I really like this app. It is not a common app. But a helpful in all aspects to communicate effectively. I like that your privacy is protected from another users, including who you are communicating. Only you and the another side can see the content. When far away is a good way to get connected
When you call iPhone you must call WhatsApp is iwhatsapp because its smart application  Thank you 
I think is this app is the best
Brings life to social organization of orderly minds
Muy buena

Wonderful app . Easy to use and to organize groups

It’s a pretty good app I can text friends from other countries without any problems overall it’s a good app
Why does my WhatsApp works sometimes and sometimes I can’t pick up?
Voice call can be a total mess, the noise filter doesn’t work properly, a lot of feedback and sometimes the volume is too low.
Estamos perdiendo plata...
It’s the best app I ever HAVE
Me han hecho un cargo a mi cuenta de banco por $11.14 cuando descargue esta aplicación. Cuando en los detalles dice claramente que es gratis !   😡😡😡😡 
All random it stopped working I thought my phone lost internet connection or something but it’s the app

Very nice
Is the new update still supported on ios 10? Thanks
WhatsApp is a great way for me to keep in touch with my family and friends from around the world. For me, WhatsApp is the go-to app to text my cousins and uncle and aunt in India. The only thing WhatsApp lacks is a WhatsApp iPad app. Other apps like GroupMe have an iPad app. I want to see a WhatsApp iPad app soon. I know that the iPad doesn’t have specific features required for the iPad but there should be a way to have WhatsApp on iPad. I have tried to email the support team about this issue but I got no response! If a WhatsApp iPad app is out of the question, at least optimize WhatsApp for iPad! If there is no WhatsApp iPad app, I may have to delete my account. I would have given it five stars but insisted I have the app a four star rating because of a lack of an iPad app for WhatsApp.
I just love it, that’s all.
Love keeping in touch with my family
The best messaging app ever, love it love it..just love it..
Could be more efficient using the cellphone battery, Specially when you have chat groups. Good communication APP. 
Muy buena
Best chat solution in market but few features are still missing   Secure with TouchID or FaceID.  Save more than 5 media content. 
WhatsApp is a very good application I love it continue creating like this applications
I’ve given 5 stars, but now that Obama isn’t reading my text messages, Trump probably is.
I have an idea for new type of massages I want to send a message to my gf and she is sleeping .. so i want that massage delivers without notification in her phone coz I don't want to wake up her .. and she will receive the massage after being online on WhatsApp . I think that type of massages good for people in relationships  And i hope you to do it in next update  Coz no apps out there are having that's kind of massages 😊❤️ 
Good

Didn’t lose contact with caller. Was a good experience!!
Wish it were easier to add and invite my contacts who are not already on WhatsApp
Finally we can delete messages after we send them!! Thats great!!
crashes while sending multiple pictures and writing under them.
Please support HQ photos and videos send
It crashes each time I open the app after update. Please release update!
Cr7ago
Will you ever create a function to select contacts who can see your last seeing? Telegram already added that and it’s cool. Just like you can choose who can see your status. For now the solution is delete the contact from your list.
The app keeps freezing up
In Qatar can't take calls not clear. Pls do something
Great service
Yesssssss finally we can recorde without keep the bottom press, huypiiii thanks whatsapp, please leave this option for ever, now wecan recorder loooonger voice mese..
I am not getting a single group chat notifications on my iPhone X. But individual chat notifications are working fine. Please fix this asap!
I don’t like WhatsApp because now there is money programs which can invade my privacy and see all my messages, old new every thing, it’s good application but unfortunately the privacy issues makes it not that good.
Anitra quiet mandarin dinero a Venezuela con WhatsApp. $10 al dis
I’ll give 5 stars when you fix this: Holding the voice note button is annoying and prompt to errors. The new hold option is welcome, but it’s still annoying having to hold for a few seconds and then slide up. Can’t you make it quicker and simpler? Gosh, you’re supposed to have the best brains in the workforce and you can’t figure this out!
Need translation for this app and it would be amazing.
Love it
Ese detalle se me ha presentado sea conexión de servicio celular o wifi. Tardan en ocasiones hasta 10 minutos o hasta que abre una la aplicación. Verificando la conectividad de señal buena
Es la mejor App!.
Until we can’t using video and audio call , We want in what’s up video and audio call to all countries 
Most usefull
I like whatsupp
Amazing
Draining my iPhone X battery after the latest update.
But we need to put voice or music in status thanks
I hate this App, the camera quality is terrible, there are a ton of glitches, and overall I just don't like it
Muy buena aplicación

Not able to use with iPad it’s not supported
I love leaving voice notes for my friends in Whatsapp. But nothing is more frustrating than being in the middle of a note, and then all of a sudden I get a phone call, and I lose EVERYTHING. 😫 Often I’ll have days where I try to leave the same note three or four times and I’ll keep getting interrupted and lose the note. Can you please make the note automatically send if I’m cut off by an incoming call?
I send videos with those app because there transfer speeds are quick.

👌🏼👌🏼
I was able to share a video that was 75M, in Cuba! That is out of normal here LOL
Excellent
I don’t hesitate to use this app for texting, sharing videos, and occasional voice calling. You can’t go wrong using it love this app.
I love this app in fact it took me more than a year installed it, but so many people were talking about its realizability that I decided to installed, used and here I am using it every day at all times. Kisses ;)
I am am avid user of WhatsApp and the audio note feature that allows me to send voice memos rather than typing out my messages.    Recently a new update allowing handsfree voice recording released, and it has really improved my experience.  There is something else, however, that really needs to be changed.   Often times I will be in the middle of recording an audio note when suddenly I receive a phone call.  When this happens, my entire audio note erases and I lose everything I had just recorded prior to receiving the call.  I have been 5 or 6 minutes into record when this happens, and it makes me really angry that it just all of the sudden erases.    To fix this issue, can something be done, please, that either pauses the recording so that it can later be resumed, or forces the recording to send immediately upon receiving a call?  It’s very frustrating to start a new recording repeating myself.  When this happens, WhatsApp will be a 5-star app for me.  Thank you. 
The ability to use Face ID to unlock the app, would be very much appreciated just like other apps such as one drive, PayPal Dropbox and so on has added that extra feature for security besides that’s works great for me having been a heavy WhatsApp user from 2009.
This app's upgrades are "hit and miss" all the time.  Hopefully one day it will be great even if you need to sell the app. 
Since the last update I can't open this app. I updated in December 1st, 2017. It's the first time I have this issue with Whatsapp. Please fix it 🙏🙏
I love this app! But now with the new lock feature for voice messages I love it even more! My thumb would hurt with long messages and this is a perfect creative fix. Now if only my Voice messages didn’t get erased when I got a call, it would be perfect! Thank you for this amazing app! Great work!
Make the WhatApp App to be able to categorize discussion and allow prioritization of text
3D touch doesn’t make me get a review to messages
Just really good
En ocasiones el teclado se bloquea, se oculta, etc.
Heey guuys please can some of you explain why some times there is red circle around the name of people who shared live location!!!?
I am not one to complain about an app. However, I use this app to talk to my family who are thousands of miles away from me. I am not able to add them in my contacts. They have to add me and text me first. Then I went to see if I could call them and sadly they are not showing up in my contacts there either :(. I have an Iphone 7 plus. I hope that the creator can find a way to fix these bugs as they are kind of big ones. That is the reason for my 4 stars.
Trying to reach their support for an ongoing issue with the app. Their answer via email was not relevant to the problem. When contacted them again never got a reply.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Thank you for reporting this issue.

I asked does notifications can be controlled by conversation groups, instead of saying it is supported or not supported, I got the response to go and read the generic help. Clarify with the customer if the question is not clear. Do not kick the bucket to waste people time.
Very nice ap

Lovey  Great app  Working well  Friendly 
Easy to install - and great taste, too!
I love using WhatsApp. We use it in our business to create groups with clients and establish great communication.   My only issue is that there is no iPad version. There’s a MacBook version but no iPad. There is a third party app that connects you to WhatsApp but, no legitimate one. I use my iPad for work and productivity and would love to be able to use the app on my iPad without sharing with a third party. Once there is an iPad version I will give 5 stars!

I downloaded the app today and no matter what i do i can not put my phone number in to get started.  I have downloaded and deleted the app numerous times. It still won't let me put my phone number in after i open the app.  Any ideas to help? I don't see any other reviews with the same problem. I have an iphone 7 plus with 11.2 ios 
Great

The update is terrible and I am begging Snapchat people to please change it back to where the stories are back to the way they were!!
just got the new update have to say it’s disgusting and i hate it it’s terrible
Used to love Snapchat. Deleting the app because the new update was so bad. Enjoyed it while it was good though. Wouldn’t not recommend this app to anyone now.
I remember when snap was simple and easy to use. Now it’s like being back in high school on the first day and they accidentally put you in advanced pre cal and you don’t know what’s going on anymore. I will probably delete by the end of the day.
At first I had a problem with the new update but then I got used to it so now it’s not that bad but then I got the recent update and all my new incoming messages aren’t at the top anymore meaning some of them I have to scroll all the way to the bottom of the screen to open
This is upsetting and this issue needs to be fixed.
go back to the old update 💯
The new update sucks👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
the new layout & screen design is very bad and makes me want to delete snapchat. it was so much better the previous way
ugh I used to love snapchat but now this update is complete trash. it’s confusing, disorganized, annoying, and no one likes it. please change snapchat back to the way it used to be please so i can enjoy using the app again.
Fix the stories
Reason I say that is because the update
I just deleted the app, I can’t take the latest update smh... it was fun while it lasted ✌🏾
Put it back
This new update terrible you guys said you’re going to fix it but you guys never did even your ratings is going down how long it’s gonna take you to realize that nobody like this update
Extremely poor user experience
Downgrade the app and you sure will get the 5 stars again :)
Snapchat has always been a really great app. I have to admit that I’ve liked it better than most social media platforms. But with the new update it’s harder to see stories or see official stories. I like the Bitmoji’s though and I like the messaging.
you guysss mad WAYYYYYYYY TOOO MANY changes. i love sc but the updates make it annoying. the Gifs are fun thou.
I love this app!!
get rid of this dang update
it’s stupid. change it back. please.
Snapchat has always been amazing! I love how you can express yourself with funny filters, and Bitmojis! Awesome!
No more snap chat for me until i hate the new update ✌️
THE UPDATE IS TERRIBLE PLEASE DO SOMETHING OH MY GOD U RE GETTING ON MY NERVES 
Bring back the old Snapchat!
Better
This new update is trash. Everything seems so cluttered and hard to use. If I could give it 0 stars after this update, I would. Also just found out the other day that if you are taking a long video it crashes the app. Anyone else have this issue?
I don’t even open snapchat NO MORE!! It’s confusing!!! I don’t like it at all!! 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
I 100% think you guys should look into this i’ve been in the sticker tab to look at the ones I made it took about 2-3 mins to load and whenever I slide down and slide back up Its back to loading again. Whenever I try to look a gif on the giphy option, there’s no search and whenever I go in and out of the sticker tabs the overlay of my search history is toppling over another random search history of tabs.
But the rest is okay good for communicating with friends
I know a bunch of people are upset about the new update, I was too at first. It just takes some adjusting and time to get used to. The only thing I’m upset about is that I can’t select stories to watch and I can’t go through the stories alphabetically. But other than that I think the new update is ok.
New update is awful. Too confusing, can’t operate, takes away good features.
Snapchat used to be such an amazing and fun app and I was on it 24/7. Snapchat decided to update and the update is so confusing and all cluttered and way more complicated. I wish snapchat would go back to normal. Many people think the same as I.
This new update is not good. And there is no setting to customize the menu. I now miss snaps from the people I follow because now the news channels are put first. As well as people I don’t follow. The “suggested” snap stories are stories I don’t follow for a reason. Manually going through to each story and “hiding” similar stories just moves them down on the list but still ahead of people I do actually follow. I can have a somewhat normal snap chat experience when I go to my message list but id I don’t message/ haven’t messages someone in a long time I still cannot access all of my friends snap stories. All in all this new update is utter rubbish. Crummy and inconvenient. Please change it back. Or please give an option to customize my home screen. Or please fix the update.
I mean it shows that you guys only care about money. People are saying clearly hat they don’t like the update y’all are acting dumb. Like I’ve stopped using it because it is so sucky. Like I really may go to Instagram permanently now. At least THEY listen to their users.
LISTEN TO US! CHANGE IT BACK
The “new” Snap terrible. It went from a clean, pretty easy to use sharing and chat app to a jumbled, out of order mess. The app know “knows” who I want to see first? People I randomly chat with have taken over my list and I see them at the top all the time, forcing me to scroll to see the actual people I want to engage with. (Obviously this is to make us look at ad content.) please, just put everything back in chronological order!
Y’all Morons should listen to your customers and change this crappy app back to the way it was. Retired snapper
I used to use snapchat for most of my communication but since the new update it’s really hard to keep in touch with friends. Not happy with this new update.
It is so unorganized. Imagine all TV channels merging into one giant channel. It would take FOREVER to find what you want. This is what the new update is like.
This update is terrible 🤮. I would really like for you guys to bring the old Snapchat back cause this one gotta go !
i like the new update. it took a few days to get use to, but i like it. i lost a couple of my streaks but that’s okay bc i got a lot me bc of this update. the new update is better,faster, and looks cleaner.
Idk who thought the latest update was user friendly, but I for one...hate it! Snapchat was much more user friendly before the last update!! I’ve found myself using it a lot less than I did before the update!! #Changeitback
Same sentiment like most others who already commented the same thing. Currently looking for something else. Barely even use this now. It was fun while it lasted✌🏼
snapchat keeps timing out, i have done everything the support website told me too but i can not fix it. i have even tweeted snapchat but i still cannot get into the app
I am amazed that so many advancements were made in the filters and bitmoji and everything that SC brought with it! Great job! I also enjoyed staying in contact with friends and family—even my mother, who is well into her 70’s is snapping! The bad news: Now with the last update, hardly any of my friends see my snaps anymore! “My Story” went from being viewed by about 90% of my friends list daily to sometimes only 1 or 2 views now. I am probably going to delete the app since it has lost its original purpose and goal. I like the filters but will likely use them, save the creation and post on IG until they surpass SnapChat’s filters. (Sigh!)
Reverse the update. No matter how long ur gona hold this update people are not going to fall for this. No one is getting used to it. So stop trying so hard. Just swallow ur pride and just reverse it. We want to see what our friends are up to not interested to discover whats going around the world.
WE ALL WANT IT BACK AS BEFORE! (: PLEASE  PLEASE  PLEASE PLEASE  WE WANTS TO CLEAR OUR CONVERSATIONS AT THE SAME TIME, WE DON’T WANT TO SEPARATE OUR SNAP-CHATTERS!!!!! 
🙃🙃👎🏾
We want the old snap back. I miss the old Snapchat, straight from the go Snapchat, easy to control Snapchat, does what you’re Snapchat. I hate the new Snapchat, the hard to use Snapchat, the bad reviews snapchat, it’s time to lose Snapchat.
Snapchat was amazing like beyond amazing. Then the messed it up. There’s a saying that goes as said “ if it ain’t broken don’t fix it. Plz i highly recommend them to bring back the old possessor. We don’t mind if u upgrade the looks of the app but the way it functions now is Terrible. Thanks u a long time user but as of late have been contemplating leaving the app. But the New update changed me from being a over 1oo  time at day launching the app to barley even thinking about it anymore... plz plz plz fix it back the way it was. To be honest  app it’s Self deserves at least a 5 out of 5 rating but this fix was 
BRING THE OLD SNAPCHAT BACK. THANKS.
baddddd
No me gusta el nuevo update, please I want old SC back😔😭
A huge cluttered mess! They have ruined the Snapchat experience... I am definitely uninstalling the app as it is useless... way to go Snapchat!!
I still don’t have the new fonts!🖕🏽
Wow this app really went to sh*t... I haven’t used in months, decided to redownload to see my inbox and the app barely runs... takes forever to load ... way to many overloaded features .. literally sh*t... unuseable and completely confusing... I thought I downloaded some weird version and had to go back and check that I downloaded Snapchat... this isn’t Snapchat.. definitely going to see an extreme decline in use because of this
SNAPCHAT DOESNT LET ME LOG IN!! NOW I HAVE TO MAKE A NEW ACCOUNT!!
Trash
The whole thing is cluttered. By trying to fit in irrelevant YouTube artists, celebrities I don’t care about, you take away stories I actually want to read: my friends.   The update is forcing us to look at what we DO NOT want to look at and taking away what we use Snapchat for: posting and communicating. If I can’t do those two things or if it’s more difficult to do, then why do I need Snapchat? Hopefully the next update reverts all of this nonsense or some great inventor gives us a better media platform altogether. 
Please update back to get everything off the same page.
Just bring the old design back! Thank you!
I know the developers ensured users that after a brief adjustment period we would come to love this new update. Well, it’s been almost a month and every time I open it I’m just as annoyed as the last time. The pages feel extremely cluttered and it feels like content is being forced down our throats. Who are these people? Why are you putting literally 50 stories from people I’ve never heard of on my discover page? Why is it every time I delete one it feels like 16 more “official stories” appear.  I don’t care. Nor will I ever.  Snapchat please. Go back to the way things were. Love your patrons. 
Hate this Snapchat
I love Snapchat, the new update layout Bogus But I do like the fact that your text can be in different Fonts and colors and I love the gifs most of all, But I do feel like Snapchat should have this thing where you can save all your favorite gifs and stickers besides the ones you can create,, all together so you won’t have to search for them all the time c:
Like others I am not impressed with the recent update. Some things are nice but the majority lacks organization and neatness. I prefer my stories how they were and my own posts in the same page.
change it back please because whenever i open a snapchat before i can even click to reply, their name goes to the bottom of the list and all the other people i don't wanna opens snapchats rise to the top.
Trash.
i can’t lose my streaks so i continue to use it, but this new update suuuuucks. i just wanna be able to see who i’m snap chatting i don’t need to to see janet’s snapchat story when i’m trying to figure out if megan opened my snapchat or not !! it’s messy and uncalled for!! please fix it.
Worst update known to man kind. Doesn’t even make sense!
اذا كان هناك تقييم اقل من نجمة فيكون أفضل  نظرا لتعقيد التحديث وعدم استجابه لشكاوى العملاء وفقدان مميزات في برامج متوفرة في برامج اخرى وشكرا 
I used to love snapchat but now it’s just stupid. I was trying to send my streaks then it kept glitching and kicking out back to my home page 🙄🙄🙄 then it kept kicking me out , like 10-15 times then finally I just deleted snapchat the redownloaded it then it finally was back to normal, so I thought. Then I realized like 5-6 of my streaks were gone and everyone’s stories were gone even though I know they posted something (like my best friends ) 😐😐really getting tired of this app
I been using this app for while now and I used to liked it a lot. But you guys keep doing so many updates and it’s not even good. I can’t see all my friends stories. Only half of my friends see my story. Some of my friends stories are the right side with other yourtubers I follow.theres people there that I don’t care about. Everything it’s a mess. Can you guys just fixed it like it was before. I also have friends that told they closed their account, I been thinking about it too.
The reason why I’m not giving this one star is because of 2017 Snapchat. 2017 Snapchat gave me a fun, easy, messaging system and dancing hotdog. 2018 Snapchat thinks compressing half of the features into the same page was somehow a smart idea. Everything feels smushed and cluttered, the stories aren’t chronological, the streak symbols are strangely unaligned, etcetera. The problems literally go on and on, and it doesn’t even solve the issue of being new user friendly.  Snapchat. Come on. Please. Look, the update just isn’t good. I know, I know you’ve been working on it for I while. I get it! Your current set up wasn’t very friendly to new users. But this update isn’t solving that in any way. Trying to use this new app is giving me a headache much worse than the couple of minutes it took me to figure out the app when I first got it.  So stop it. Listen to your users. We’re “giving it a chance” and so far we’re hating it. Eventually your users are going to get kind of sick of giving you that chance so get ready for it (instagram stories doesn’t have dog faces but they do have a usable design). If you’re going to insist on this update remember: Just because it’s new doesn’t mean it’s good. Or just please let me un-update.  UPDATE: It’s been a couple weeks and I’m getting used to it but it’s less “hey I’m actually starting to appreciate this new design” and more like “I never look at stories anymore and keep getting annoyed by the random people on my explore page  and this feels like getting used to a blister.” 
Snap chat, listen to the voices of the people! I can't find my friends story's, every time I click on one it's one I have already seen then it automatically takes me to a random strangers story that I DONT CARE ABOUT. The whole format is messy and I can't tell what is what. Team Snapchat, do you think you're being artsy by stylizing the whole platform. It's an eyesore! It's way too colorful, i can't tell what the symbols mean. I DONT WANT TO DISCOVER NEW PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IF I CANT EVEN SEE THE STORIES OF THE ONES I WANT TO FOLLOW AND WANT TO SEE!! Thanks for the gif update tho
The newest update has completely soiled the Snapchat experience. There's no doubt about it, Snapchat messed this one up. Swallow your pride and reverse the update Snapchat.
This update is the reason i deleted snap. Instasnap it is
This new one is awful. I’m not using Snapchat all anymore. I hate this update. Take it away.
Not need a single need to try it
I really enjoy using Snapchat everyday but since the new update i don’t use Snapchat as often. With the new Snapchat it’s much harder to use and deal with. I be having random people appear in my explore which I don’t need. I really hate how i have to delete conversations every time someone have uploaded either a video or photo🙄. I do miss the old Snapchat and you can  tell how other people don’t like the Snapchat update that much since the rating have gone down. Please change it back
The extra frown face filter is HORRIBLE. My makes me look worse than it already do bro.
I hate the update stories of people i care about is nowhere to be find, but stories of people i do care about is buried down deep where i have to look for them.
Please change back to the old Snapchat I hate this new update I don’t even like looking and Snapchat stories anymore
This new up date is terrible horrible. My friend changed he password 15 time just to get the old update back. Snapchat used to be the only use of my phone but now it’s as if I don’t have on
SC messed up with this new update because it is straight TRASH and I wanna know "Just Why" SC🤦🏾‍♂️
Maybe mix the new design with the old. Like it’s confusing, bring back the old messages but add chat heads at the top of the people you message stories. The discovery page should have its own page with all the recommendations.
so it takes forever for my little gif stickers to load and it’s pissing me off lol
The snaps from my friends aren’t even in order! They’re all over the place
Like yo I know y’all see the terrible reviews, at least just make it so it’s in order of most recent snaps smh we can compromise with that
Please change the update to how it was before. The messages one side while the stories are on the other side again thank you.
Not only is the new Snap Story layout confusing and poorly laid out, Having other people’s stories who I don’t know is annoying. Snap chat should definitely go back to its original story layout before the update. Everyone who frequently uses Snap and myself can all agree that we hate this update. Please change it back
paying for snap filters and replays was bad but this......this is an atrocity. keeping snaps separated from stories was probably the simplest and best way of organizing this app. you could scroll through by time posted, check the older ones and rewatch easily with the alphabetical order of stories. now, its hard to do that because of the odd algorithm with no purpose. no, really, i cant seem to figure out their way of stories. the people i snapped 20 minutes ago are buried under the stories of people i snapped once or twice- a year ago. it would make sense if the people you interact with the most stay near the top (best....friends.....perhaps ((duh)) ??) but that doesnt seem to be the case.   the streak/best friend thing not being aligned to the right makes for a confusing, jumbled mess of an eye sore. sending a snap to said best fiends was confusing, the layout of the best friends list didnt make sense at first going from left to right, back to left, on the second row then right again etc. vertical makes the most sense style wise and practicality wise. also, have text chats always counted towards best friends?? if i remember correctly the answer was no.   the celebrity stories get mixed up between the “official” tastemade, buzzfeed, the dodo etc stories so its hard to sift through that because honestly i just dont care about a popular beauty guru ive never heard of before and dont care about. if i wanted to see them, i would have subscribed/added/followed.   new bitmojis are cool and all! but there should be a multiple choice option for styles like before. i havent restyled mine because im not a fan and it looks nothing like me, but now i cant change stuff w/o being forced to restyle.   checking your story is a lot of unnecessarily extra taps. swipe from the camera to stories, tap to view. tap the top, tap to view. as someone with little hands and an iphone x this is hard to do with one hand.   overall, it takes too much brain power to use, and i hardly check it except to send streaks, when it used to be my main form of communication. its just too confusing to use, the text is too small, the discover page is way too big and jumbled, and, did i mention its confusing?  if snapchat is THAT dead set on not un-updating, then maybe a new update is in order...reverting back to the separation of stories and conversations, aligning the best friends and streaks, and more bitmoji options (its my least concern). i get wanting to rebrand, its what everyone needs to do every now and again, but creating a WHOLE NEW APP ?? cmon, snapchat 
Please separate the stories from personal snaps. It’s all cluttered and I use the app less now after the update.
It was fine the way it was now it’s just complicated and not even fun to use anymore. It also lags horribly especially when I try to record videos and I noticed a lot of my friends have the same issues.
CAN YOU GUYS UPDATE SNAPCHAT AGAIN?! IT HORRIBLE I CANT FIND ANYONES STORY! CHANGE IT BACK TO NORMAL🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡👿
Change it back
Wack update
hate the new update.
Lots of people don’t like it, and I’m sorry but can you plz bring the old one back.
enough said. change it back you were making so much money why make it horrible for no reason.
This new update is really disappointing Snapchat, I used to really love using this app. Can we please, please get the original format back??
I’m not going to complain about the update, people just don’t like vetoing change once they become familiar with something. One thing that motivated me to write the review is the fact that my memories NEVER load. My memories tab is full of blurred pictures with that annoying white, endless circle that continues to spin. I checked if it was an internet problem, nope. I tried to log out and back in, no luck. Please fix this issue.
Why did you change the format it was Snapchat? All my friends the 136 don’t post pictures and videos anymore. Your killing your app, if the new format new was organized like the old one, people with live with it. Old and New is a good mix. I hope you get my idea I’m talk about.
my thing didn’t update so i can’t write in the cool fonts. of put several text in one pick but we’re trying else is all updated. help
GIVE US BACK OUR OLD SNAPCHAT, this update is so lame. I like my messages and story’s being separated it’s just a big mess with them together it’s just go much give us back of old basic Snapchat.
I had been using snapchat most of the time before they changed the layout to this new one. It is really inconvenient for me since I cannot see any benefits of this new update because they made things more difficult rather than being smooth and easy to use! People want things to be the easiest to use and the most efficient for performance and speed. I don’t want to search whole Youtube just for knowing where are my friends list in the new update😒
Please for the love of god snapchat please fix this terrible update you have created. I would hate to delete this app, but this godforsaken update really has me thinking about getting rid of it.
Snapchat, the update is truly horrible, put it back to what everyone is asking for. Also, now that purple you ARE NOT friends with can add and just randomly start chatting you me and my friends have received strange, concerning, and dangerous snaps of predators online or people just trying to be rude. Yes, you can just block those people, but how about not letting people you don’t know not snap you!! I will be deleting soon because of this reason
Nothing is in chronological order, and you can’t delete all conversations at once like before. The new update is trash.
Snapchat... Stop trying to do all the fancy crap and just go back to normal. Just making a simple and widely used app like this go to waste and more complicated. You say you want satisfaction then take it back to how everyone wants it. Like do you not realize that people are deleting Snapchat cause they hate it. Change something or soon y’all are about to go bankrupt or something like that.
I love snapchat. It’s a fun and cool cool app to intersect with all my friends. The filters are so cool and I love them. The downside are the map and the new update. I barely have any views on my stories. Please change the update to make it easier!
I really don’t like this update and you lost mad money because of kylie so please change it back I hate the snapchat update that’s why people barley use it👎🏼 I don’t even wanna use it anymore
I hate the latest version of Snapchat. They ruined it for me
Listen Snapchat and listen well I don’t care how busy you are this is important. If there is no possible way to revert back to the old version delete the app entirely and start all over because you have no right to go ahead and completely change a format that did not need changing you were in over your head thinking that Snapchat needed a change originality is what this generation craves and you have lost not only over millions of dollars and millions of users but you have failed and instead of being so stubborn you can admit your mistake and delete the app all together and start a entire new platform because this is unacceptable
the updates just keep getting worse most likely going to delete Snapchat
just bring back the old version it's not that hard.
I use to love Snapchat they did good I would be fine if they added another page or seomethkng . Instead they gone just clutter it then they don’t even care about the people who are using it . I hate this update they need to stop if it ain’t broke don’t fix it I signed the petition to get it un done. They just don’t care it makes me mad they could care less how I’m happy majority of the people all over even celebs hate it that should tell u something it’s not just some pre teen boy tryna cause drama everyone hates it . I just have no respect how they handled it they just don’t care bout feedback like wowew
Terrible... Snapchat in the past is way better... I ask everybody and tell the same thing. Back to old snapchat please... terrible.
I hate the new update I want the old version
update is trash
I am not a fan of the new updates I wish they would go back to what it was before
I’m super disappointed with the new update. I do not like that I have to search for my stories. I want my chats and stories to be in 2 different places and I don’t like the discover page. The new update is very unorganized and is very cluttered. Please fix it. CHANGE THE FORMAT. CHANGE THE FORMAT. CHANGE THE FORMAT.
The new update is TERRIBLE!!!! Please switch it back to the old layout!!!!!!!!! Pleassssseeeeee!!!!!!
From 5 stars to 1. What happened? This new update is confusing and hard to use. I'm at a loss
Use to be good before the new update the story’s and messages messes up a lot of stuff you can be snapping someone and double tap there name and at the same time someone can add to there story and you send a snap to the wrong person
The new update is terrible
I’ve used Snapchat for nearly 3 years and the old update was easy to maneuver and deal with. Now I’m losing half of my streaks everyday, the app is EXTREMELY slow and I’m not even wanting to use it anymore. PLEASE go back to the old version. Everyone wants it, why can’t you listen to your reviewers and see that you went from a 5 star rating to a 1.8 and below star rating? I know that if the app keeps being slow, telling me I’m getting snaps when I’m not, and making me lose streaks when I know I send them everyday I’m going to stop using it. What’s the point of using an app you enjoyed but no longer do? The only upside is the new fonts and editing things when you go to post something. That’s it.
I thought that I was going crazy at first but i know I’m not . I screen recorded and showed to people that I updated the app on February 9th . And that I don’t have the new features, I tried logging off and on , restarting my phone , deleting the app and download it again , it’s getting annoying because I kinda feel left out and I really wanna have the italics font , but update is not working . Snapchat has been trash since the update that changed everything
All of a sudden drains my battery and crashes continuously
It’s good but with the new update it’s just weird to use and confusing it should go back to the original way it was
Many of the new additions to this app have made it worse and more difficult to use.
The new Snapchat update is not good, everyone liked the old one.. Snapchat is getting a lot of low ratings because of this new update. The old snapchat was perfect. The new one is horrible. Please change it back to normal because your getting a lot of low ratings. Im fine with the bitmojis update. Please change back..
I love Snapchat like let’s be honest here. But one I didn’t ask for you to be updated and once you did update I have never been more confused looking for my friends story. It is just so confusing now and I don’t like it I want it to be the way it was previously before the update. 🤕. No one uses Snapchat anymore because of this confusing update
I don’t like the new update. It’s not all bad but you should’ve kept stories and messages separate instead of combining them, because combining them made it more confusing to use and it gets really frustrating at times.
Its trash now
Reminding you that i still hate the update and whoever created it
I love this app but I’m not able to use my front camera on the app please fix or I’ll give up on this app
I feel like I don't even see my friends stories anymore and I have to search to even find who I want to talk to rather than them just simply being at the top. This is so annoying and I only use the app for streaks at this point. May stop that soon though because it's so garbage.
I loved Snapchat so much until the release of last horrible update... but now I don’t :(
Awful update. Snapchat used to be my favorite app to use, now I barely use it because of the new layout and format. I understand the need to highlight the stories but this literally was the worst possible way of doing it. If you were looking to drive all of your users to Instagram, you have successfully found a way to do it. Please consider changing back to the old format and find other ways to update your app.
I came back to edit my review again, from a 2 star to a 1, if i could give you a 0 I would, now with the new update already being ruined and then adding this newest update every time I swipe to see my chats you take me to \"groups, stories, or all\" no matter what you do with this new update you\'re making it worse, and it\'s clear you don\'t care about what everyone\'s saying and how the reviews dropped to a 2 star. I don\'t expect you guys to change back after all this because you\'re selfish, but I do wanna say shame on you for caring more about stupid adds and stores no one cares about over what the ppl really want!! You sold your soul Snapchat for something that didn\'t even take you anywhere besides downhill!!
This update is trash. Add me on Sc: TinaBenaWena
I love Snapchat im on the app more then im on any app i still use snap after this update but i think i can speak for everyone we want the old snapchat back like for me i like to view certain story but in order to do that i have to scroll down a lot and i don't like doing that i like the fact on the old snap you can choose who’s story you want to view in order quickly i like to chat with friends on one page and view story on the other so snapchat please bring the old snap back
This app is trash now. Update is terrible. Your designer is foolish he probably ride the short bus. If I could give 0 stars I would. Id delete the app but the hoes be on here so I can't delete it.
Ever since y’all did this horrible update, the app seems to have a bunch of bugs
Heavily preferred the previous Snapchat version before the massive overhaul that came with the most recent update. I felt Snapchat was operating on a five star level before the most recent update. Hope this information is useful to the company and any other frustrated users.
This update is horrid. I hate this app now. I have no clue where to find my friends. All it is is random people on my right and random assortment of friends on my left. There’s not even a friends list anymore. Change it back. Listen to your users.
Myself and most of my Snapchat friends have now gone to Instagram to share stories. New snap design means many more swipes and taps to sort through and view stories of interest. Discover section is irrelevant and disorganized. I use Snap to share experiences with FRIENDS, and have other media apps for everything else. The one thing Snap was unique for is being sacrificed for advertisements and $$$.
i’ve been a long time snapchat user over the years and I’ve never had a problem until this new update, even though it has slightly gotten a bit more organized from the jumbled mess it once was, I would love for there to be an option to go back to before the update. The new update just doesn’t make me want to talk to my friends through snapchat. Another alteration I’ve been wanting to see is being able to change your username. Most people are embarrassed of their usernames that were made years ago and want to make a new account but don’t want to lose their memories and high snapstreaks. If there could be any way to link accounts or to just simply change usernames, that would make many people’s experience a whole lot better.  thank you, a long time snapchat user 
Ugh
this app used to be my favorite one, i used it all the time. everything was great with it until the update. it ruins it completely and i sometimes don’t even open snapchat because i don’t wanna deal with it. i hardly watch stories anymore and so many of my friends have had to end their streaks because they can’t handle the update. PLEASE change it back
I hate hate hate hate what snapchat has done to there self this app was sooo good until now. Screw this supdate I can not get used to it
I HATE THE NEW UPDATE. THE ONLY THING I LIKE IS THE FONTS!!!!
Im pretty sure nobody likes this update GIVE US THE OLD SNAP BACK!!!
The new update ruined the feel of snapchat for me. Everything feels so cluttered and unorganized. The entire experience has been ruined. It’s very aggravating when I want to go through my stories or find a specific friend without having to open up the search box option. I’m surprised and disappointed that the developers are blatantly ignoring the uproar over this update.
trash update SMFH
Snapchat use to feel personal, where you can enjoy YOUR FRIENDS, FOLLOW WHO YOU WANT. Now it’s all jumbled and weird and impersonal. Having the discover page is ridiculous! AND THE CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER FOR THE SNAPS! My goodness. It was a bad terrible idea. And i strongly hope you guys would REVERT BACK, y’all did it once y’all can do it again! Thanks 🙃
THE NEW UPDATE SUUUUUUUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!! Change it back!!!!!!
i hate the new update like cmon now. Snapchat what the hell are y’all doing. Nobody likes the New stupid update so please change it back. I get no views now.
App uses so much battery. Stories are harder to deal with. And not to mention it’s laggy as all get out. I HAVE AN X IT SHOULDN'T LAG
This new update is very inconvenient, and I feel there was no need for it.... there was nothing wrong with the way it was before. The new set up takes your streaks out of order, you miss many stories, and since the update.... the number of people that use Snapchat has decreased dramatically! I also recently noticed that my streaks randomly disappeared and restarted... without the timer!!! My streaks are set up so I see all them at the same time, and I haven’t seen a timer before the streak ended. After emailing the company, they didn’t cooperate and was left unsatisfied.
I feel like I have used Snapchat much less since the new update. Not to mention: there is way less interaction from my friends. IMO, now there is way too much emphasis put on strangers/celebrity information. The entire point of Snapchat is “exclusivity”—people in your contacts. I just can’t relate to the new update, and I find myself caring to check my Snaps less and less.
The new update is terrible! I hate having all the stories I don’t care about where my friends stories used to be. And definitely dislike having to sort through my friends stories just to snap my regulars where conversation used to be. Y’all should go back to the previous edition, this update is awful!
If asked how I felt about Snapchat now I would say disappointed,discombobulated, and disenchanted. I honestly cannot believe that their board/chairman would decide on this update.
I find the new design incredibly cluttered and it inconvenient. I cannot find my friends stories, can only view them once, and a group story I was in is also missing - can’t find it anywhere even when I know it has been updated. It is not located in the same place it is on my friends phones. Please fix this issue.
The New update is absolutely terrible. That’s why your ratings are down to 1.8. Change it back and we would actually enjoy the app again. Everyone complains about it, yet you still won’t change the update back to the old one. You clearly don’t care about what your users want. Instagram also has Insta story. Lots of ppl are leaving Snapchat and using that. Wanna know why? It’s because of this crappy new update.
This update was really uncalled for the OLD UPDATE NEEDS TO COME BACK ASAP FOR SNAPCHATS ON GOOD OR ITS GOING TO BECOME THE NEW VINE OF 2018!!!
FIX THIS UGLY ISH actually atp I don’t even care I’m deleting this app
It's really irritating when every time I try to watch a vid "NBA" for example, they all freeze and show the loading symbol after one sec and never load... I have perfect connection and it just acts like it's still loading. Please fix
So I Like Snapchat It’s Just That’s Where The Stories And Messages Are They Are Very Confusing And I Like Them Better When They Were Separated. I Don’t Like The Group Chat And Stories Together. But Everything Else Seems Pretty Good In My Opinion.
The new Snapchat update is terrible and so confusing to navigate. Bring back the old one!!   -sincerely, EVERYONE 
I was forced the new update like everyone else and I didn’t like it but now everyone has cool fonts and such. Mine on the other hand has none of that. If I’m forced to have an update at least give me the good parts of it not the part everyone hates. Thx
I’ve updated my app multiple times and can not get my font to change to the glowing font, colorful font, etc. But i have the new layout which is horrible. No idea why they would change it
Although I think Snapchat is a very useful, fun and easy app to use, it would be helpful if we could have more specific divisions. Instead of having “Groups, Stories, All,” it would be a lot easier to have divisions like, “Stories, Chats, Groups, All.” I’ve had a lot of trouble getting use to the divisions. I’d try to select one of the conversations but it would move before I could get to it and be all mixed up because someone posted on their story. It would be really helpful we could add in a chat division to swipe to so we could have a focus only on chats when we need to. Thank you.
This app is terrible. Absolutely terrible. Everyone thinks that, and yet all you do is make ridiculous ‘upgrades’ that just make it worse! This update is so cluttered and I can never find what I’m looking for. It is like the Harry Potter stairs. Everything is always moving around. Please do something to fix this. I’m begging you!
I love snapchat I just wish I had a better phone to use it with and I'm so glad snapchats is an app and I hope people enjoy it to but my phone won't let me download it again😥
If it wasn’t for the streaks I wouldn’t use it. I hate this update more than anything
Don’t like the new upgrade for nothing the other one was sooooooooo much better WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY? WHYYYYYYY?? Did u have to go change it Y’all should of left it ALONE👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽 I’m all for change but not this chenge SNAPCHAT 😩😢😩🤬🤬😡😡😡😡🤬🤬😡😡 very upset with this Horrible & I mean HORRIBLE upgrade Change it plzzzz😤..!!!! I mean you can tell by the Ratings no one likes it !!
I absolutely hate the new update!! I hate it. Every time I want to look at stories it doesn’t show me all of them and every time I take a picture it turns out darker then the actual picture. Undo the update to make everyone happy because no one likes it😠
Your new update is terrible. Do better
Ever since this update I can’t go to my friends list and view my list of friends. When I try to use the help Snapchat offers it isn’t up to date with the update. So it’s no help at all. I want to be able to view my friends list and edit it please.
Snapchat is crazy since the update i can’t even add friends on there now !!! Really thinking about deleting it
I didn’t even update mine ! When i go to the AppStore it give me the option to update but my app itself is cahned so you guys better fix it because i didnt give you permission to update it!
Used to love snapchat, but now with the new update I used it barely any and it is a horrible app really. Too complicated and the lay out has no meaning to it, it’s all random.
It would be more fun if people could Carmet and likes pic and video!!!!!
There has been a recent update that put gifs into snapchat. My phone says it updated but the app hasn’t changed at all. There are no gifs or filter for messages, stories, or all. I would like some help. I have deleted it then downloaded it again
This update is terrible everyone thinks so might as well change it
Don’t fix it
Y’all should make fruit bitmoji’s
I see people with diff writing styles in here and Friends have tried to show me how. I have the updated version but for some reason I don’t have it available to me . what’s up with that?
I honestly HATE this new update. I have a lot of people added that didn't add me back like famous people. So when I try to look at their story, I have to search for them by scrolling and it's a hassle. My friends end up telling me what the person posts and it's not fun. So HOW do I DOWNGRADE for the OLD and BETTER Snapchat FORM because the NEW is TERRIBLE! Rating one star.
This new layout is horrible. For several reasons! I loved Snapchat and now I don’t even want to use it because of this new layout. Bring back the old layout with chats and stories not all jumbled up together. The updates besides that are cool but the new layout is a complete clusterfuck and its complete junk.  Please fix it back to the old layout because I guarantee you’ll get a bunch of good comments and stars back when you do. Also more usage from everyone on the app again. Please and thank you in advance!
Personally, I hate the new update, and so does everyone else. I used to go on Snapchat everyday but now I don’t because of how much I hate the update. I even lost all of my Streaks because I just don’t go on it anymore. I literally take the time out of everyday to delete the app and make a new password so it goes back normal for a couple of hours.
snapchat, please do everyone a favor and put back the old version.  And like why does Snapchat waste battery?????  NO ONE LIKES THIS CRAPPY UPDATE 
I bought the rainbow vomit filter when it first disappeared and after a while I noticed it was just gone im not sure what happened to it , someone explain
5 stars out of 5 stars... Until the update. I don't really have too much of a problem with the look of the new page. It's something new and it only took a few days to get used to. The only problem is that this update made the app much slower for me. To send a Snapchat to someone it lags and delays most of the time. It is annoying. However it could be because I don't have the latest iPhone but that doesn't seem to be the issue. If the speed of the app was fixed for me I would be happy to give it a nicer review because overall Snapchat does its job and has enhanced my use of social media as a way to communicate. Another complaint would be the stories page now continues to put stories up that I do not want to see. Snapchat must add a feature to only display certain categories that the user selects. For example, I am only interested in the sport stories but I see stories about food and news and other topics useless to me rising to the top of the page even though I click 'see less of this'. Anyways, good app only a few complaints that majorly bring down the stars I will give out
Bring back de old weey
Snapchat you need to change this update
App just keeps getting worse
I hate the upgrade fu$@&ck it
LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY USE THIS APP AND CHANGE IT BACK TO THE WAY WE LIKED IT!!!!! EVERYONE HATES THIS NEW UPDATE AND IT DOESNT MAKE SENSE WHY SNAPCHAT WONT CHANGE IT BACK ???? WE THE PEOPLE ARE THE ONES USING SNAPCHAT WHY WOULD WE WANT TO USE THIS NASTY UPDATE THAT LOOKS LIKE MY BIG TOE ???!?!?!!!?!?!
Everybody is so tired of this new update I can’t find anything like if I see it I have to look at it right then and there I saw something on the discover part I wanted to show a friend so I locked my phone until I got to him by the time I got to him it was gone they need to go back to the old format before everyone deletes the app.
Don't like the new update ☹️ It's giving me a hard time honestly
The small lil update that was made to fix all the controversy from the last is still beyond confusing. And it’s beyond complicated to open up anyone’s stories. It’s also annoying that the incoming snaps aren’t in chronological order. It’s just sad to see this app go down the drain. The discovery page is also useless because if I wanted to read any of those articles I’d just google it myself. Wasteful.
Arreglen el snapchat cabrones
Look at your reviews! This app is a mess. Whoever decided it was okay to let this update happen knowing we’d react like this is a mess. Why should we have to get used to this downgrade? Maybe you want more profit from the discovery pages and ads, but couldn’t there have been a better way without sacrificing the convenience of the app??? That’s what made this app so popular after all. At least put everything back in chronological order 🤦🏻‍♀️. I’m so tired of trying to look through all of my Snapchat friends, and I don’t need you to constantly switch up the order to figure out who I want to talk to. I have no control anymore. This update wasn’t convenient at all. Take our reviews into consideration, because by the looks of it, we’re not gonna settle for this and most likely will move on. Who even asked for an update like this? This “update” just set it up for a heavy downfall in the long run. It’s not half and half of mixed reviews. It’s almost all of us. If you want to make money, keep your users happy because when we’re not using it anymore your ads or discovery pages are useless.  edit: again, at least put it in chronological order! I’m tired of accidentally tapping the wrong person’s name/opening the wrong snaps whenever it refreshes! I don’t think this app will be able to know who I want to talk to because I basically talk to everyone or no one at all. They’re mostly short conversations every once in a while and not frequent. 
self-explanatory
Every since their famous update, I hate it.  I can’t get the stories which subscribe for without the other BS stories that I don’t care about.  The search is a total disaster because I cannot find people I want but those others.  Does discover has to look like a mess? To me it does looks messy and crowded.  I do not recommend this app anymore because it is not entertaining.
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it." The new update is terrible and clearly I'm not the only one that thinks this. Can Snapchat swallow their pride and revert back to the previous interface.
The newest update automatically updated on my phone, which after hearing everyone complain about it I was hoping to hold off as long as I could. I don't know why app companies feel the need to completely redo their formats. The user ability on this app decreased for me so much, that I think I might just use the Instagram stories.
Please go back to the old update the new one is very confusing. Snapchat was a enjoyable app until the change making lots of complications, therefore changing it back would be great thank you.
Listen I get that you’re proud of your update and I’m sure it cost a lot of money. However, a company that does not listen to its consumers will ultimately FAIL. Be smart! Listen to the feedback you are receiving and adjust your business model accordingly. I myself as well as many others have quit using your app due to this new update. You’re killing your gold egg laying goose.
You guys should make it so you can control who you get notifications from when they snapchat you so you don't have to get notified when annoying people hit you up.
this app is by far the worst app ever. For starters I don't know what the developers where thinking besides how large a pay check they'd get after this. But people who are tempted to download this app should take into account their will be adds in their story , if they snap a lot. There is also this thing called "discovery " which if your into how rich people spend their life then download this app asap. On that note they do about the same level of work as 3rd grade child when it comes to delving into other subjects such as science, history &maths , and a bunch others. When they do go into a science related subject, the article is not really correct or accurate due to the lack of research on the editors part. the person could actually correctly explain how ( editor statements ) is wrong) /theory is not correct using the scientific method of approach. Only daily basis it's not a big deal but when you have young kids watching something like that the incorrect way could prove fatal due to nonexistent research or not enough research.  So please ffs don't use this app if you want brain power. Plus you could just do group chat and throw in some picture mssging
Well the app is great but I want it to automatically let you download it with the new update. My phone will only let me download an older version because my phone is not updated because snapchat wants your phone to be updated💜. But all and all its a pretty good app💚 happy snaps everyone 💙💙💙
I've always enjoyed Snapchat, I've had it since the beginning so I've seen all of its forms. I do not mind this new update as much as some people but it is bothersome in a couple ways. I'm not sure about the stories and conversations being on the same page because although it's not confusing it's just annoying.  Sending snaps is a little terrifying now because you have to make sure you send it to the correct person by triple checking. Some of the names are cut off so if you have two people with similar names, it's a little difficult. 
New update has messed up the app so much and they really need to fix it because everyone is going to leave the app
I still hate this update but it would be better if on the friends side it was divided into 2 categories instead of one: “friends”, and “stories”. So they aren’t mushed together. And on the discovery side.. should be divided into 3 categories not two: “all”, “official stories”, and “subscriptions”. It would be better because if I want to explore official stories from people, I don’t want to see things like buzzfeed. And when I’m texting someone I don’t want to accidentally send the wrong person a msg or snap because their story popped up in the person I was texting’s place.
Just missing the old Snapchat
I really enjoyed using Snapchat before the update. I loved the originality it had from Instagram, Facebook, Twitter etc. With the new update, I feel like there is an ad or someone I’m not friends with story popping up constantly. For some reason as well, I feel it is more difficult to rewatch one of my friend’s story than it was before this update. :(
Just bring the old layout back. I love Snapchat, but this new layout is so cluttered it's stressful to use it.
I loved Snapchat up until this update 🤦🏽‍♀️ don’t even use it as much anymore
Horrible! The update is HORRIBLE🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑
I used to enjoy Snapchat a great deal, however this last update is so frustrating it makes me not want to even use the app! It used to be very convenient to keep in touch with family members and friends that were a great distance away, however now I cannot find their names to snap them, view their stories to see my nephew. This update has ruined the app!
The user friendliness of this app has been dumped down the drain. I am fully and wholeheartedly disappointed with how far this app has gone from how fun it used to be.
I get y’all want to have a whole panel for the content you’re paid to display and certain stories but y’all sacrificed user experience and functionality. I can’t find my friend’s stories and many others are having this issue. Hire me and I can help create a balance of the two.
Trash
Bring back the previous version. I absolutely hate the new update. You’re going to lose so many users if you don’t bring back the previous version. Accept that it was a wrong move by Snapchat and bring it back. This move is suicidal and Everyday I’m getting closer to deleting the app since I don’t use it anymore due to the update. It was much easier how it used it be.
You’ve gotten billions of messages saying to bring back the old snapchat. I agree. Atleast bring back the separate stories, or change how the stories move people’s snapchats (sometimes they move down the list, sometimes they move up). I’ve sent so many snaps to the wrong people, and I’ve received many snaps that were meant for someone else because of this new update. Please fix it, it’s extremely annoying.
I don’t even wanna give this one star because this is awful I can’t believe snapchat went and really did us like that. So mad. Go back to the tried and true thank you.
When I first got Snapchat I absolutely loved It. The filters were cute, app was easy to use, easy way to text and communicate with others, ETC...  but recently Snapchat updated and everything changed. The new platform to me, and according to others, was a bit confusing and took a while to adjust to. Now Snapchat looks totally different and I personally do not like It at all. It was perfectly fine the way It was before. 
I rather have the old version. It’s better and easier. This new update Snapchat is irking my soul. Don’t like how I have to swipe right to look at everyone’s snap. Wish it was the old one again.
I can’t view my saved snaps because the app always cancels it within 15 seconds of me looking at saved snaps. Idc about the new update just fix this bug
Ever since it has updated recently my snap is acting out weird. It is so annoying. They should changed it back or really fix the glitches that my phone keeps having, but they really should switch it back.
This new update is horrible take it off !
I love Snapchat, but I can't even use it anymore. I hate the update
The new update is awful and everyone I know hates it. This update needs to go away.
I am slowly getting used to the new update and seem to like it more and more. However, my streaks disappear from time to time but come back. Also, when I open a snap it always goes straight to the bottom, which irritates me when I’m trying to answer them quickly. Just some small feedback
Why do I not have the cool font like everyone else? I will give you guys more stars whenever I get the cool font
There is too much going on. Why are the stories of my friends in the same location as my chat?! Also, allll of these pointless stories on the discover feed. If there snap is public it does not mean I want them on my feed. Get rid of that. There tons of random peoples story's and I keep clicking less like this but it seems like I am getting more like it. What was wrong with the last version before this update. I am on the verge of deleting this app. Viewing random peoples story should be an option or at least a different screen people could swipe to see public story's. You have made a once simple and fun app into a very busy and confusing app.
I updated my snap to get gifs...it said I got them and they are yet to show up!!
Snap is a JOKE NOW  It’s a no from me y’all switched up fam  THIS WORSE THAN KD LEAVING FOR THE WARRIORS 
Snapchat is awesome some but I wish the username could be changed at least once.
Change update
I don’t know what happened but I was on snap maps and it crashed and now I can’t open the app without it crashing 10 seconds later
Updating your app with no idea the entire layout will change is a shocker. It’s incredibly scummy to force that on people without their knowledge.
It was just fine the way it was... why change it?! When looking at my own snaps, I swipe up to see who viewed them. When I swipe down... it swipes completely out the snap. You all did too much! Whoever came up with this design... is an IDIOT!
Worst update!!
The new Snapchat update ruined my life and I hate the app, thank you very much for this. Please downgrade.
I have had Snapchat since I was 10 I think even when I was not supposed to have it then but now I\'m 13 and the update has ruined everything !!! I can\'t even send my streaks without the app closing, or being laggy! I heard you guys have agreed to reverse the update on February 20th, but until then, I\'m uninstalling the app sorry guys 😐 I\'ll only go on Snapchat for streaks and that\'s it unless it changes!
WE WANT THE OLD SNAPCHAT BACK BUT WE WANT TO KEEP THE GIFS AND WE ALSO WANT TO INCLUDE POLLS AND BRING BACK THE THINGY THAT SHOWED YOUR TOP 3 BEST FRIENDS
I don’t use snapchat as much as i did before the update. The update is bad and confusing.
Just change the format back from what it is now... answering snaps and looking at specific individual’s stories has never been a challenge to me until this frustrating update came to be. Please just change Snapchat back to its prior golden age of simplicity!!
CAN WE GET THE OLD SNAP BACK??? I’m considering deleting the app because of the update!! 😤😤
Please create another column for our conversations/streaks only😭
I don’t like the setup of this new update and my app always crashes and I always have to uninstall and reinstall it for it to work
If it isn’t broke. Why try to fix it??  Awful update.
I miss just looking at my friends stories I’m tired of seeing random people stories on the top of my list I don’t care about discovery. please change it back. thank you.
The new update is terrible
I’m very disappointed in the Snapchat update. It was such a fun app, and this update seems completely unnecessary. So many people are hating it so why not just put it back the way it was?! Like come on, your rating is almost a one star at this point! As for the Bitmoji aspects, the new features work fine on their app, but when I try to use the Snapchat filters my Bitmoji changes. It’s as if the new features just don’t work at all. Get it together, Snapchat. You’re going to be the next MySpace at this rate. 
^^
This update is not what’s up ... go back to the other one .
Seriously. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it. All that clutter. I don’t need more chaos in my life Snapchat. I liked the 2 separate screens. Personal/Public. It worked. You guys smh well that’s my feedback. Actual service ain’t bad but visually there’s the problem.
BRING BACK OLD SNAPCHAT YOU IDIOTS. YOURE LOSING MAD BUISNESS BC OF THIS.  B E  S M A R T!!!!!
this update is aweful. i have lost so many streaks and you can never find the stories. overall it just needs to go back to the way it was. all of the stories about stuff that i dont even follow or care about is annoying.
NOWWWWWW
Would give no stars if I could.  Update is terrible.  Just a jumble of videos I don’t care about, can’t find the ones I do follow. Friends videos and photos get lost.  Not worth using anymore.  Back to texting and Facebook.
I’m Confused with these new updates compared to the original snap from before
Snapchat used to be a great app until it updated. When it updated none of my friends liked it, it is horrible. Worst update ever. Please downgrade soon.
THE APP WILL FREEZE AFTER I TAKE A CUTE PICTURE WITHOUT GIVING ME THE CHANCE TO SAVE IT AND IT WILL GO BLACK AND EXIT BY ITSELF
The new version of this app is impossible to use. Would not recommend.
get rid of your dumb update no one likes it
snapchat makes me want to kill myself more than geometry.
the entire app is now 10x slower, the friends tab is weirdly grouped with stories now and the original stories tab is a fustercluck.
Smh
The new update ruined Snapchat I wish I could give it zero stars
زي الخرا واللهي
I love this app it is so awesome it needs more filters though
لايعجبني التحديث الجديد
Horrible update that makes me want to not use the app at all. Everything is cluttered and I cannot go back and easily rewatch my friend's stories. Also, people I never talk to show up high on my chat page just because they posted something, and that makes no sense. Go back to the old version please!
Honestly hate how I didn’t even have a choice to change my Snapchat and then you guys say you’re going to revert it back and have the nerve to just update it more with the new version like what is wrong with you people. Clearly nobody likes this update and it’s ruining Snapchat. Seriously just thinking about deleting the app all together it’s ridiculous because I actually really use to love Snapchat.
Guess it's true what they say, you don't know what how great you have it until you lost it. In a way I guess we should thank Snapchat, they rolling out this crappy update will be off our phones little more. It's long been time to grow up and get over this app, this update for helping us do it that much faster.
The update is so horrible, I’ve literally stopped using the app as a whole and went back to Instagram. Do better Snap.... do better.
I’m really deleting Snapchat now. I’ve lost all interest in viewing people’s stories and being on the app in general. THATS ALL IM GOING TO SAY^^^^^^^
I am not at all happy with this new update. I have many friends who feel the same way. Could u please just change it back. Please and thx
If I could give it a one star ii would, worst update ever!!!!!!!!
It’s frustrating you can’t see a friends story again. Make it easier to view my friends stories.
no. just... No.
i love snapchat. i use it everyday and it’s one of my ways of meeting new people talking to new people. however, like a lot of other people i was very upset to see that the app updated to a horrible update while my phone was not in use. i try not to use it as often because it’s so confusing. i would actually use it more if if they could make it how it was before. not very impressed anymore.
This new layout is trash!! I don’t hardly even go on Snapchat anymore because of it. It used to be great. You would think that you would listen to the feedback and switch it back.
No one uses it anymore after the update. Straight trash.
NOBODY likes the update
Snapchat is the most used app in my phone before the update but after the update, snapchat became very confusing and not pleasant to use. I and all the snapchat users that i know are unhappy with the new update
I use to love Snapchat until the new update  I use to give this app a 5 now its a 1 I don’t even use the app anymore it made everything complicated and it messed with my views 🤦🏾‍♂️ deleting Snapchat until they get it right
i wish we could change our username please fix this!!
Please separate the stories again!! I hate the small blue circles. I still hate the update and am considering deleting snapchat.   You took a great design and ruined it. I feel more disconnected from my friends than ever, and it feels as though you are forcing sponsored content down our throats. 
It’s fine lol
THE NEW UPDATE HAS ME AND MY FRIENDS SALTY!!!  No one is liking it and it is annoying to try and work now.  We all are thinking about just deleting the app and finding a better one!!!  The update is harder to work and the old Snapchat worked better for so many people.  Everyone is giving up their streaks because it is too hard to keep them all.  I think you should change this new version of Snapchat back to the old... I lost my highest streak because of this update!!! 🙄 please consider changing it back to the ORIGINAL!!!
Don’t get me wrong I love Snapchat but I absolutely hate this new update, and so does a lot of other people, it doesn’t work that well. So I hope that we get the old Snapchat back and fixed🙏🏽
Snapchat has dropped from a 3.6 rating to 1.8 and has lost 1.3 billion dollars in stocks since the update, but they still haven’t rolled it back. This company does not care at all about its users. Deleting the app.
I don’t know why snapchat updated, literally nobody uses it no more because of the update. I mean if snapchat likes having 1.8 stars on their app review, i guess 😂
Please tell me the old snapchat is going to come back?? It’s so hard to navigate the new update and I’m waiting for it to go back to the recent setup!!
Snapchat es una aplicación muy buena pero la última actualización me dejó muy confundida es como si todo estuviera desordenado A muchas personas no le gusta la nueva actualización por la misma razón que a mi. Así que por favor espero que para la próxima actualización todo vuelva a la normalidad o que no sea tan enredado como ahora luego, cambiaré mi valoración
Dude where did my favorite app go.  I used to use this app for everything  I feel like a great thing has died.  I have yet to hear a friend say a good thing about it. 
Update as of 2/28/18. Trying to scroll through who viewed my story made me think I was autistic. Then I realized your management team is.
They said they aren’t fixing the update “no matter how mad users are” 😂😂 alrighty Snapchat have fun being the new myspace. Maybe you should actually listen to your users considering that without them you’re nothing. The ceo is going to go broke at this rate.
The New Version Is Bad
I was fortunate about not to update Snapchat but many have and I have seen how bad it is. Save yourself
I really love snap chat it’s just I did the new update and I don’t even have the new rainbow letters
Smh
Sort the chats out by time, it’s so annoying that chats that I sent earlier today are literally with chats from months ago. Not only that but they constantly switch. I don’t like having to play hide and seek with my conversations 🙃
only problem is all the news media stories are extremely biased in a liberal way.
WE NEED THE REAL SNAPCHAT BACK PLEASE!!!!!!!!
I hate this new update. It makes no sense. Its not in order it just Stupid.
I love snapchat soooo much! It is my favourite thing ever, unfortunately the new update is forcing me to hate this app!!!! Hopefully snapchat will get rid of it 😥
Used Snapchat everyday, after the latest big update I don’t use it as much I used to.
the update is wack
I heard that a lot of Snapchat users are not very pleased with this update. I am one of those people who actually enjoy it and I am proud of what Snap Inc. accomplished through it. Those who say I’m lying, think again, because I truly love this update and I think some of you should find a way to enjoy it. Disagree all you want, but don’t come after me because this is my opinion. I hope that I make myself clear and I hope you guys understand where I am coming from, and know that not everyone on snap hates it :) thank you.
I hate new version
So there's a new update to fix the annoying update they did a while ago. My boyfriend has it...but it's not coming on to my phone and some other friends too. SNAPCHAT CAN YOU MAKE IT MORE AVAILABLE?! I hate the random stories popping up so much.
Once again a wonderful fun app has turned into a piece of garbage by main stream media. They feel our heads with half truths and make us feel lesser than the "stars" featured on them. Thanks Snapchat
Please consider changing the layout. I don’t like that public snap stories of people I actually want to see are included with stuff I could care less about. I end over just avoiding that section all together. Please change the discover page. It’s not working like this.
I like snapchat I really do, but this update is just plain old dumb. Everything is so small now and totally unorganized. I have probably Snapchat the wrong person like 20 times now because after I open someone’s snap it goes down a couple of people because of the stories or anything, making me select the wrong person but not realizing it until later. This is very annoying especially when you don’t want people reading your business. I can officially say after weeks of using and getting to the update, I hate it. 100% done with it and I realize I gravitate towards the app less and less.
I don’t understand what’s going on, but the new update is horrible. Y’all just made Snapchat 10 times harder to use and more complicated for no reason. The old format was good and easy to use. however, now everything is all mess up. Ever heard the saying? If something ain’t broke don’t fix? Well, you guys have messed up Snapchat. I am a loyal consumer when it comes to Snapchat and I stay there even when all my friends had moved to Instagram stories. Now I’m thinking about leaving Snapchat to. The worse thing about this is Snapchat updates itself without my permission. I look at the new update which is 10.25 and it says nothing about a new interface. All it said was new Bitmoji and that’s all. You guys force this update and that’s is not right. Y’all lied and force something that is unwanted by the consumers. One last thing, Snapchat all you have to do is to add a tab for private message and I’m pretty sure a lot of the commotion will stop. You already have a tab for stories, group, and all. Just add one more for the message and things will start to look up for you guys once again.  Users are upset over the cluster-ness of things
i love snapchat and it’s my main way to stay contacted to all my friends but i was super mad when i woke up and it updated without my permission lol 😂😂 but yeah it’s so disorganized now and i barley use it
Garbage
Terrible app used to be decent.
I have been using this app since the inception of it , with the new update I have decided to uninstall the app and start using ig . Have y’all fufu lames heard of “ if it ain’t broken don’t fix it “ y’all over there at Snapchat hq are some fufu lames
Hey Snapchat,  I think the main problem everyone is having is that our recent chats and friends recent story uploads are mixed together...or just randomized. It makes it very difficult and frustrating when you have to search your friends name when you literally talked to them 10 min ago.   Your right in that new is good and people will eventually get use to it, but come on let's be honest...this update is a complete mess. We won't be mad if you admit that (; 
I like this app
I encourage downloading Snapchat to discover all the spots in your house your vacuum didn’t get to. Finally can invite family, friends, and inspection agencies over with absolute ease!
It is obvious you’re ratings have decreased significantly. The new update is an absolute terror. There should be an option on which version we prefer at the very least. I do not like seeing conversations from YEARS ago popped up on my friend screen. There is no separation from friends list and stories, which made the app so easy to use! I have since deleted the app on the day of the update and will not return unless there is a way to have some organization within the app. I am saddened being this has been my favorite app since 2012. Very disappointed.
This new format has totally killed snapchat. Its so unattractive and I barely use it now. Either fix it or lose more money 🤷🏻‍♀️
You took something that was perfect the way it was and turned it into the most confusing and tiring thing ever, I don’t care the have the entire world of Snapchat on my interface I just want to see my friends and the few celebrities I follow! I don’t want them in separate locations, I don’t want to have to swipe back and forth between my friends stories and public stories!!! You’ve made a completely jumbled up version that’s far less enjoyable. 👎👎
I hate when apps have a good thing going and then decide to change it 100%. Who asked for this update?! It’s so confusing and annoying to use.
Every app goes there, the huge grab for the money. In snap’s quest for monetization, it hides snap updates from friends into its news section... hoping you will be enticed into clicking an article so it can draw in the revenue. Way too busy for me to use this: Snap has OFFICIALLY JUMPED THE SHARK! Deleting app with a sigh of relief!
I loved the app before the update the update made it way more difficult and annoying
The new update and friend page looks horrific!  Change back to the old version ASAP!
Please, it'd be so much easier to start from there.
The new update is trash, but mainly my one star is because they took away my pizza bitmoji selfie How can I show my love to pizza now? 
I like the concept but it’s too disorganized. I use this app daily to keep in touch with friends. However, when some of my friends post to their story I don’t ever get to see it because It never comes up on the main page unless I search for their name. I also noticed that my Story views have decreased since the new update. Also I have 30+ streaks and since the main home page has both conversations & stories I end up losing some streaks. It’s really hard to find my friends stories & to keep streaks with this update. Add in a feature where we get notified when a streak is about to end Atleast. I hope this app is fixed soon or an alternative app comes soon
The only reason why I still have Snapchat is because of my streaks. I hate it. Kill it off. Now. This update is actually terrible. Literally.
I love Snapchat and all but sometimes I’ll send streaks to someone and they will send it back but streaks still get broken 😕. I think streaks would be easier if there was more time to send streaks and if there was a notification saying “You’re about to lose streaks with .........”, or something like that.
The new update is awful. I tired to be optimistic but I don't understand it at all, I feel like a grandma who's trying to use a phone for the first time. Please go back to when it was easier we don't understand.
Snapchat designers needs to put their pride to the side and go back to the old version of Snapchat, everybody hates the new update and the people on here that claim they love Snapchat must be new to the app.
Used to love this app. Now I can’t keep streaks or watch stories so what’s the point. Many things could’ve been added to be positive like best friends but this update is complete trash. I’ve tried deleting the app multiple times and my auto updates are off but apparently the app took matters into its own hands. Completely Terrible.
They gotta fix their stuff because my streaks keep on disappearing and coming back the next day.
So are we done acting like this update aint trash...... bc im done pretending.... change it
The update is bad but it could be fixed with ONE TWEAK , make messages and stories Into two different sections and you’re golden
Snapchat has been one of my favorite social media apps for quite a while, but this update is just really confusing and personally, I think it’s more difficult to do things and find things. Lately the app has been crashing A LOT for me and it’s rlly annoying. This never had happened to me before so I’m pretty surprised. Hope they fix it soon, other than that, it’s a good app
I really use to love Snapchat but I’m starting not to like it that much because of the update. For one I don’t like having my messages and stories I like it the old way. then if you want to chat with someone know you have to search for their name & click “chat”. Rather than just going to the messages. Also the Snapchats stories are aren’t in alphabetical order & time order anymore which makes things very confusing & makes you have to search names. I can’t even half open messages anymore & my views SO much because of this whole  update. I really hope you guys are thinking about bringing the old update because many people & myself are not a fan of this new update even Kylie Jenner.
I dislike the new Snapchat. Please bring back the old one.
I am reviewing Snapchat again. I do not like it..... why can I NOT delete my list of snaps? I will clear the cache and it automatically closes, and when I reopen, the same list of people that I just deleted are still there. This is hogging too much space on my phone now. The update is horrible and I won’t be using as much. Thanks Snapchat for making it so confusing just when I started to like. Bye bye!!!!!
700 THOUSAND bad reviews of the update people leaving for instagram in droves and. Ehhh. Lets stick with the system people hate.   The update made me start using facebooks snapchat. It works much much better. THANKS !!   Seriously the worst changes ive ever seen in an app. Its mostly useless now. Whos idea was it to make the adds page separate from stories. No reason to even look at it now. Hahaha. Cant see who sent what. Just yuck. What garbage !!!!!!!!!!!! 
The filter for girls only
the new update is horrible
i have used snapchat from the very beginning and this is by far the worst update ever. no one asked for this, why aren’t snapchats in chronological order and stories are completely in viewable. peace out snapchat hello texting pictures of my face to my friends everyday. i’m just wondering how this update even made it through the first people who reviewed it before it was sent out UPDATE ITS EVEN WORSE NOW
Used to love this app. Now I'm just confused on the way it's organized. It really isn't organized at all. It just feel cluttered. I may stop using it soon because of this reason.
i have been a snapchat user for a very long time and it was great it really was :(, i really dislike this new update , it is was too difficult to “get used to” , your ratings have dropped , you’re losing money and followers. the more you have this update , the more followers you’ll be losing.
STOP MAKING CHANGES PLEASE!! NOW I CANT SWIPE OVER A LITTLE IN THE CHAT TO SEE WHAT THEY SAID IF ION WANNA TALK TO THEM. CMON SNAP, YOU CAN DO BETTER
I understand they needed to change and adapt to whatever they think is best for them, but this interface is absolutely infuriating to use. it's not only three times slower to use, it's unintuitive, and I have to click and swipe around like crazy just for the most basic of things. every choice they made to change what was already perfect into borderline useless is the saddest thing I've seen an app do so far.
Now
not bad first time i fell this update not good bit after 1 week i feel that’s great
The update made this app trash
Every time I record a video it has no volume it sounds like my phone is being suffocated I go to my iPhone camera and it sounds perfect
For some reason this new update with the fonts and cool stuff won't download on my phone my girlfriend showed me she had it on her Iphone6 and i have a iphone7+ but it keeps telling me i downloaded it and it won't show up on my phone now is this just me or are other people having this problem too
I used to love snap chat and thought everybody was exaggerating about the new version and how much they disliked it so I tried getting used to it but just can’t. The new version is geared to celebrities and celebrity gossip and is no longer user friendly/ easy to use with friends.   Yes I now know how to tell the difference between a snap sent to me and a snap on someone’s story but that doesn’t mean it’s easy to use like before and I now find myself looking for new and easier apps to use.   If anyone knows of one please let me know!! For now I’ll only use this for messaging & can only imagine how much everyone’s snaps have decreased.   Because of the confusing setup I now only recommend this app for following Celebrities & their drama.   The only recommendation I have is to switch snap back. PLEASE!! 
I’m on an iPhone 6+, but my gifs aren’t working how do I make them work? They won’t show up
the new update on snapchat is the worst. I can not tell where anyone is. they should put it back to having stories separate from the personal chats. in the new update it has groups, stories and all but there should be another category for personal chats so we can find people easier. and another thing is sending a text in snapchat should count towards the snap number that you have because it is still a snapchat just not a photo.
So the update is cool but I just hate that you get stories your not subscribed to and I think that is just dumb
I Hate The New Update ! I can't see people messages in time and it takes forever to reload.
I used to love Snapchat and used it everyday. Since the update, I hardly am on the app. Snapchat is no longer user friendly and is disorganized. I would have never updated if I knew it was going to make Snapchat so complicated.
Ur ratings went down no one messes with the update so jus go back n leave it like that thank you have a nice day
Having everything combined into one thing is completely disorganized, I hate having to squint to see what my streak is w somebody. I LOVED Snapchat and I used it all the time, but now I dread opening the app. PLEASE REVERSE THE UPDATE😫
This update is the worse. It is hard to find your friends and to the stories you want to see. The right hand sides screen is complete trash because it is all the “famous people” story or the people who are on public. Stuff that I don’t want to see is on there and for that same reason I made my child delete it because it was showing stuff that is irrelevant to their life. I just would like it back the way it is.🙃
I love snapchat but i only have one thing in mind. Can u please make snapchat work without wifi! 😫
I honestly was so hyped about giphy being added bc I use it on the regular in my messages out of snap, but when I wanna search for a giphy, it takes too long to load! Maybe it’s just my phone? (IPhone 6) but the load time is kinda annoying ://
very bad
The update is absolutely horrid.
This new update is awful. Why change something that was already working
YEET
All I ask is that you change it back or make it easier
The new update is awful. Period. The end.
I don’t mind the visual aspects of the new update, but I’m super peeved that my feed isn’t chronological anymore.  I’ve got random folks I rarely snap showing up at the top. What’s the deal y’all?  Edit: I’ve had another issue recently where I’ve been snapping one friend a LOT, and I used to never snap her even though we were friends on the app.  Every time I need to snap her something, I have to scroll super far down, even past people that I’ve never talked to on the app, to find her. 
Before the newest update, I would have given 5 stars. I loved  Snapchat for the fun filters and the direct way I could see my friends and families snaps immediately. I also loved the fun filters and how easy it was to communicate in an efficient and fun manner. I will never get used to the way it’s set up now!!!. I am not interested in any of the adds or Hollywood snaps that are thrown in my face when I get on to check updates. Ugh!!! You ruined it for me  and everyone I know is or has deleted a perfectly good app. SAD. Please change it back!!!!
Terrible update. Go back to previous format
I hate this new update and so does everyone else. i really would like it if you guys would go back to the old snapchat instead of having the stories and chats on the same page . it’s making my views go down . And i hate it !
At first I didn’t think it was as bad as everyone said. But the more I use it the more I hate it. If something’s not broken... don’t fix it.
All the stories of people I follow need to be in 1 place like the list it was. I could care less about viewing the discover stories they need to be hidden or something. It’s so messy now like why. I’m always losing streaks
FIX THIS UGLY UPDATE . It feels so clustered and can never fund anything especially now that they are not even in chronological order 🤦🏽‍♀️ if you gonna make the update so weird at least have it make sense. Look down my feed and its 49 minutes ago and then the next is from 12 hrs ago. FIX IT 🤦🏽‍♀️.
I hate the new update.
Now my purchase of spectacles are useless, I’m trying to get used to it but it’s not organized. Stories need to stay in a separate location than messages. Plz fix, instagram stories... there are to many of them. Maybe that’s your game plan?
New update is pathetic. We want to see our friends stories
لاانصحكم ب تحميلة
CHANGE SNAP BACK!!! this version is the worst.
Frustrating, useless, not enjoyable to use
We should have access to be able to change our usernames. People grow and having a username we made in like the 4th grade is not a good time. If you could take this into consideration I would highly appreciate it. I know you guys change more “famous” peoples when they ask or you do it automatically. Thank you.
Get rid of the update. Bring back the old snap!!
DISCLAIMER: This app DOES NOT provide a lifetime supply of creamed corn AS IT PROMISED! Very disappointed.
As an avid Snapchat user and also a programmer/designer for apps I’m thoroughly disgusted with your lack of awareness for the end user... this update removes the ease of watching your friends stories but makes it easier for users to see “sponsored” stories, this is nothing more than a way to make more money and it’s awful.
I used to spend many hours on Snapchat, but with this new update its really not good at all. Everything is messy and overcrowded. I hates the app and it’s so hard to find the new snaps. Also the snaps are replayed again when I already have watched them before. I understand that you are trying to make the app easier, but it’s not. Could you please bring back the old version.
Okay so what's the deal? I got logged outta my snapchat and went to log in but I'm obviously hacked. I tried recovering it, but I never connected an email address to my account, only a mobile number. And yes, I've tried resetting the password with said number. Nothing works.
Honestly I love everything about it...it is awesome and I love Snapchat!!! It’s a great way to stay in touch with your friends and see who has the highest streaks thru out all your friends❤️ but there is one problem...I really really wanna change my username Bc it is (guccigang185) and honestly I only put it as that Bc I thought the song was dope asf when it first came out but now it is really annoying and my username is such a hue cringe...I waned to change it but I can’t...I just want an update where u can change your username. I want to change mine to my name for example, (b.water77) brianna water idek who that is but it’s whatever😂 just plz plz plz make an update where u can change your username at least once. Thank you for reading!!❤️
Just trash
I hate this update 👎👎👎👎
Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhd
Just fix it and every thing will be ok or someone is going to get hurt
Please undo this update. I keep snapping random people who I don’t have streaks with and also I’ve lost so many of my streaks because I keep getting confused. It’s super cluttered and confusing and I can never find the stories I want to watch.   Please please please change it back, i think that your 1.8 star rating should speak for that. I saw that it was at 4.0 just before the update rolled out. Want a good rating again? Make us happy. Thanks.  Please change it back already.   I also just lost all my streaks so thanks. 
Is horrible
WE DON’T WANT NEW VERSION CHANGE TO OLD SNAPCHAT OR YOUR APP WILL DELETED BY APPSTORE FOR 0 RATING
Hate the new update. 😡😡😡
This was the best app until the update and the new layout
Snapchat, I used to be addicted to you but now I'm in serious withdrawals.  I can't find the stories of people I intentionally follow.  When I do find them, if I close the app and come back, or they've added to their story within 24 hours, it takes me all the way back to the beginning of their 24 hour story.  I don't need to click through snaps I've already seen.  Sometimes I close a story if I'm around people and I'll come back to watch later, then when I come later I can't find the story at all.  Just because I closed it doesn't mean I didn't want to see it at all.  Now, the app just keeps freezing and force-closing when I'm in the middle of watching a story.  Then, I have to watch their entire story just to get back to where I was when the app force-closed.  I used to watch every persons story by the end of the day and I knew I saw everything from people I intentionally follow.  Now, I'm probably missing most stories, unless they bailed on Snapchat altogether.  I don't want to go to Instagram, I really love Snapchat, but this is just plain awful. I've given it a few weeks and it's still not getting any better.   Some people I follow don't follow me back and that's ok, but I would like to see their daily story.  I would like to see the people I follow in one place, and not mixed in with ads and people I don't follow.  Oh, and please stop force-closing the app while I'm using it.  Is it possible to fix Snapchat?! I would appreciate it.  I don't want to break-up with you.
Absolutely confusing and trash. I don’t even see how this could benefit the “discovery” section because there is no incentive to visit it now.
Your guys update is terrible please put it back to how it was I don’t talk to half the people that are on my list now to see there stories.. that I don’t even look at. It’s hard to tell who who you have a streak with and who snap chatted you. It’s also hard to tell whether or not someone opened your snap or left you on read please fix this everyone hates it! WORST UPDATE EVER! I still hate the new update can we go back to the old format where can I call and complain🤔 
I loved Snapchat, and have been using it for the longest time, and I love that you guys constantly update the app often. But this time, you guys messed up BIG TIME. I must say that this is the worst update you guys have ever made. Snapchat was perfect before, and you guys messed it up a lot. It was so simple and intuitive before, now you guys moved the stories to the same page as our chats, and made it difficult and confusing. We liked it better when you guys had the stories, and discover page combined together, and not this separated ugly new interface. When you guys sent this new update out, your ratings have significantly went down. It was a terrible move on your guys’ part. You’re also making people and celebrities stop using Snapchat because of this crappy update. If it’s not broke, don’t fix it. The only new thing that I like about it is that you can now have different fonts, and that’s it. Everything else just looks like a messed up perfection. I have been using this app for such a long time, and I loved it the whole time, before this update came. Just please give us the old interface back, and we’ll start using Snapchat again! Or you guys are going to end up like Vine.
For some strange reason I am unable to use the new fonts feature Snapchat has rolled out with the latest update. I have updated 3 times, uninstalled and reinstalled, singed out and signed in, to no avail. Absolutely unacceptable that a company would roll out new features to select users, and not seed the new features to other users.
To cluttered and focuses on advertising more than the actual snapchat and watching stories is one of the main things about snapchat
Snapchat WAS good now they're trying to change things and the new layout is terrible!!
I’m losing streaks left and right.
No thanks. New update it’s just not cool enough.
Used the stories to keep up with sports with espn and bleacher report. Now those are lost in the flood of garbage stories from people I don’t care to know about.
Newest update ruined it
I know that snapchat probably doesn't even read these, but i'm just here to voice my opinion that i literally used snapchat everyday since it got popular a few years ago, and i didn't mind any of the updates until the random stories were beginning to be added to the story section. At first i just brushed it off, since i didn't really see them pop up much really. But with the new update, you guys completely took away the section dedicated to seeing your friends stories, and replaced it with an ad page. I thought snapchat was about interactions between users. Now it's just for money. You're prioritizing monetization of the app, over from what i understand; the entire purpose of the app is. The funny part is, snapchat had money to pay employees long before shoving terrible BS click bait down snapchat users throats. So anyway congrats on ruining the app that you guys pioneered and i guess i'll be using instagram stories from now on
literally. It still lame and the layout is hella ugly. listen to everyone’s comments.
you guys over at snapchat inc fuuuucked up everyone at my school stopped using snapchat officially
Y’all    I love Snapchat but something about the new update makes my music shut off on Spotify every time I get an alert      It’s driving me crazy
The new update is not working on my iPhone X , I can’t see the new fonts when I type .
Like everyone else I think this update is terrible. It made no improvement to viewing stories and has made finding people to message very difficult if not impossible. I'm not sure why anyone would want to have stories and messages mixed up into one another. I've had unread messages because they were overlooked as a story. Be fore this I loved the app and would have given it 5 stars.
I love using Snapchat but taking one photo or being on for a minute to reply to someone has my phone going from 100% to 85% it’s ridiculous. Non stop glitches and says someone is typing when they aren’t or deletes messages even if they’re saved. I hate the new update so confusing to use why show the people’s stories twice. Lost a streak because it was at the bottom of the stories. Please change and now also trying to save a photo to my memories or camera roll my phone does a complete shut off and that needs to change or I’m deleting the app. It used to be so good and now it’s constantly freezing and glitching
The new update has made using snap very difficult.
I’m rating this app a 1.5 because after i’ve logged out logged back in, deleted the app and re-downloaded it. I still have the new update & it’s not worth using anymore, although there’s many views on it and many using the app. I just think in my own opinion, to get the old snap back instead of this one that over half of Kentucky dislikes.
Snapchat went from being my favorite app to hating it no one can understand why they changed what already worked fine.
new update is whack i get it “we update it to make things better and people just need to get used to it” but this is not the case. i do t use as much as a i use to because of the new update
the new update is trash, please bring back the old snapchat
Make a way for people to get the old Snapchat version back
TmZ is a joke and so is SnapChat. I don’t want to see when the last time Kim Kardashian picked her nose..
If this isn’t changed there will honestly be no reason to use Snapchat. Instagram is going to be the better option for everything. Really loved this app until the update.
I have never made a review on something till now and it’s because I’m literally so mad at this stupid update. I shouldn’t have to type my friends usernames in to find them because I can’t find them anywhere else because snapchat reloads itself and won’t let me look at their story because it brings me back to the top. It’s annoying. I don’t watch everyone’s story. Stop trying to make me. This is horrible and I have officially deleted snapchat for good 🤷🏻‍♀️
The app was pretty cool until it latest update it changed a lot of features and just killed a great Snapchat experience.
This update made Snapchat messy and congested. Please fix it, Snapchat!
👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
Snapchat knows nobody likes the new update. And we all know they know. They’re just ignoring us. They updated the new update but only made it WORSE. Tread carefully, Snapchat. Don’t take your users for granted. A bunch of people have lessened their use of Snapchat since the update and that says a lot. I’m only still using it for my streaks and don’t use it as much myself. Undo the update! No one likes it. Do not take your users for granted or you’ll regret it, Snapchat.
Please go back to the old Snapchat. This new style is very unpleasant and everyday I grow farther away from using Snapchat
You could have changed the whole look of Snapchat without having to force us through this cluttered nonsense. Stories are prioritizing whose on top of my list. When I do not talk to them. Some friends stories are in the discovery for no reason at all. Terrible terrible update. You guys were on all the right tracks until this one.
Snapchat is so cool u can face time and call friends and so much more the flitters when u take a pic is so flawless omg I can’t even hope fully Snapchat never goes out
I'd give it a half star
Not only is the update terribly difficult to navigate, but now the app is forcing me to shift through all the stories of snapchatters who pay to have their stories pushed onto our newsfeed. Basically there is no order to the app anymore and you can pay to have snapchat harass other users with your snap-story.
This new update is cheeks, doesn’t make sense to complicate it
Tbh the new update just killed Snapchat for good. It’s not to late to save it!! Bring the old sc back
I updated Snapchat and even uninstalled and reinstalled it a million times and I still don’t have the different fonts 🙃🤦🏾‍♀️ if anyone knows how to fix it please dm me on instagram (since it’s the best social media out rn 😐) @_rayyisbae_ (btw the new update is TERRIBLE so I’m gunna have to give you one star 😊)
We need the old Snap back.
Mannnn, I absolutely hate the new update! I used to love Snapchat, it was my favorite app, but then y’all decided to update it to this complicated, backwards, upside down app! I hate how the messages and the story are in the same place! I really hate Snapchat. I’m always trying to figure out if i want to delete it or not. I really wish they would change it back to the original app!
If you do not fix this app I will move to Orlando and join Jocelyn Flores. All because I had depression from my obsession with Snapchat. This update is a Nightmare where everyone dies, they will get Revenge on you for this. I know feel dead inside so give me the Explanation to Carry On. I was in love with Ayala and this app but now F*ck Love because I can't even communicate with her anymore. So please Save Me, don't let me die at age 17. Love- Xxxtentation
Give US back our Snapchat what the crap!
The new update is awful.
The app has gone to garbage. There are paid stories on the discover tab that i never asked for. This app went from simple and decent to jumbled and these donkeys at snapchat are just greedy for revenue. Nice job guys, i hope that money was worth the hate.
How can you turn something so good so bad so quickly? This app just got stage 5 terminal cancer and the chemo it needs is going back to the old snapchat. The worst pain I have ever felt is not close to as bad as this update.  The old snap was great and I miss it along with almost everyone else. This app makes me want to spontaneously cumBUST.  This is worse than android photo quality. If this isn’t fixed I’m throwing my phone over trumps wall so I don’t have to see this app again. Maybe the illegals can fix it and then throw it back. If that doesn’t work I’ll send it on Space X and maybe the aliens could fix it, but if you change it now you will save me and Elon Musk the inconvenience. Thank you.
you know what i'm taking about
Sad to see Snapchat in this state. Smh...
The black lash from this ridiculously stupid update should be enough to give you guys whiplash . Bring it back cuz you loosing people
stupid new update. change it back snapchat!
This update has made the app so annoying to use, if you don’t have snapchat yet I don’t recommend getting it now.
Each update gets worse
Booooo
New update is absolute garbage
i hate the update, it's super cluttered (and my views have gone down by like 100, not exaggerating) i'm actually thinking about deleting the app
I think the update is the best thing they could have done. The old design was clunky and I hated that in order to see stories from friends I had to also see all the celebrity crap too. I can only handle so much about people I don’t even like. This update is perfect. Keep making it better Snapchat!
I hate the new update!!
This app was a 5-star app before the update. Now, it is trash.
whennnnnnnnn are ya going back to the old snapchat . i still can’t get used to the new one like come on nobody likes it . get ya stuff together snapchat or everybody is gonna stop using you
The update took something everyone used and made it an incomprehensible mess that is beyond help
I made a amazing private story with people all over the world who post in it and it really was a social accomplishment of mine. Since the new layout nobody veiws or posts in the story anymore and it’s really upsetting I hope you fix your layout to make it more story friendly.
La peor de las versiones sí más palabras
I have always been a light user and maybe even lighter user now bc its just Getting too confusing now. Put the messages back the way they were showing you who you last spoke with instead of changing order based on story. I do like that you can instantly look at their story from clicking the icon to the left of their name i don’t know if it’s always been that way. Also the same way you guys don’t play sounds when my phone is on silent until I hit the volume rocker when I want to hear the audio, do the same for the ads it’s bad enough your force feeding them to us after we watch a story.(I understand it’s for revenue) Even though you give us the option to watch a users story. But at least don’t blast the audio on the ad at least give us that.
I enjoy using Snapchat . It is still a great application . This new update is very messy , unorganized literally ALL OVER THE PLACE. Please bring back the old format !!!!!!!!!
Please fix this trash a** update. I used to love Snapchat with a passion, fav app to socialize on.. but alas now it has turned into a pile of heaping, steaming, stinky doo-doo. And that upsets me. You have a chance to make this right!! Please!! I have faith in you Snapchat editors.
Change it back
The new update is terrible. Y’all are trying to do too much and it’s making Snapchat even worse. It used to be good. Why would you mix stories with friends?? Y’all think we talk to ALL of our snap friends?? And y’all think we care about ALL their stories? You’re wrong. We don’t. Please change it back.
زي الخراااااا
this is horrible
Ever scince the new update sc lags and wont send picture messages PLZ HELP
G this update is terrible like if i could rate y’all with zero stars i would. It’s stupid af. Stories all out of order. I’m seriously done with this app.
The new update/version is horribly disorganized. Like honestly what were you guys thinking?? Just wanted a change? It was perfect the way it was.
Literally ruined my favorite app. I don't even use it anymore. Undo the update. I can't find anything and half of my friends are gone. I keep getting forced into seeing random people's stories who I don't even know
It baffles me that this company is aware of their customers dissatisfaction with the new interface but still has not reverted to its old look. I can guarantee i won’t be using this app anymore if this continues
Please go back to the old Snapchat. No one likes the new layout.
New caption update to change the color is not working . Overall good app
Omg this is so horrible!!!!!!!!! Please Snapchat bring the old one back!!!! Pleaseee
Literally use to love Snapchat! And the newest update is horrible. Hate it. Definitely deleting off my phone because I really don't enjoy it anymore. Maybe if they change it, I might bring it back
Love the new bitemojis but this update has to go, it’s very confusing to use 😐 i can’t even see when ppl text me they end up at the bottom of my list. The older version was better
I would’ve deleted it but it’s one of the only ways to contact some of my friends 😪 pls fix it
lol please Snapchat go back to the old Snapchat everyone stopped using snapchat after that update. It's so confusing and not in order.
Just can’t do Snapchat since the redesign in early February. It has become a cluttered mess and it’s really easy to miss updates from friends, especially their stories. It was once my go-to communication app but has become something I check begrudgingly once every couple days or so. Disappointed Snapchat hasn’t taken user feedback seriously and has continued pushing its mistake of a redesign.
The recent update is highly displeasing
The new update is trash they used to be at 4.5+ stars & went down to 1.8  They really think not reversing the update is a good idea ? 🤣😪 
Snapchat used to be a great app to me, but the latest update made it confusing to use and disorganized. If I send a message to someone I do not want to have to sift through everyone’s story to have to find my message because it has been moved due to my snap friends adding their stories. Also, if I don’t desire to answer a person snap now moved unopened messages to the top of my message/stories which is also unfavorable to me. It was a great idea to make the discover page more of a free form kind of deal where one can find people they may not have even knew had a Snapchat accounting, but everything else was better off the way it was.
You would think they care what the users think?  Guess not. Instagram it is! 
I’ve been using Snapchat for 4 years and it has been rad but the update ruined it. Still not used to the change and finding people’s stories is ridiculous. Change it back!
Hate the new update. Can’t stand that my friends’ snaps are mixed in with endless ad stories- none of which I’m interested in. With no way to revert to the old way, I just deleted it and switched back to texting in my phone.
If I wanted to see the kardashians, I would follow the kardashians.   If I wanted to follow high school lyfe, I would follow high school lyfe.   If I wanted to know what Justin Bieber is up to, I would follow Justin Bieber.   But I’m following my friends and family and it’s not alerting me when they post something. I don’t know why Snapchat thought any of this was wanted, but it needs to be reverted. I want to know when my sister in law posts something. Not when the Kardashian’s breathe and the world is sniffing their butt again. 
I really think you guys should go back to the old version. With the new update I barley even go on Snapchat any more..
Had snapchat for about 6 years now, loved until the last update. I hope you are satisfied with your short term profit gains 'cause you're losing users! See ya team snapchat!
This new update is horrible. It’s hard to function, too much is going on, there are things on my TL I don’t care to see. The people have spoken, change the update to the previous one.
I used to love Snapchat. It was my go to app.... the update has completely changed that for me. Bring back the old version!
I don’t like the new update An I don’t know many people that do. Can you please change it back. Snapchat was a lot easier to use when we had the original update. It’s harder to text friends An streaks An look at stories.
التحديث السناب شات الجديد والاخير اللي فيه ثلاث خيارات باليسار فاشل و زبالة 😡👎🏻 رجعو التحديث القديم 
My snaps are in random order. It is not sorted by relevance. It looks like you took my contacts and hit the shuffle button.
There new update ruined this app for me
The new update is terrible.
Snapchat was golden, then they tried to fix what didn’t need to be fixed. The main problem I have with it is when I try and click a snap to open it, it disappears and gets reloaded to the bottom of my chats. Making me scroll all the way down just to find the one person I was talking to. Sometimes when I get to the bottom it goes back to the top and the process repeats itself.
Can y’all change the update back to the old one 🙂
The update needs to go back to original or get some organization . It is terrible I hate it and it has stopped me from being on snap chat many others have this same complaint  . Please fix quickly !
I used to love it, the update made it complicated
The update made Snapchat the worst DO NOT DOWNLOAD
Reverse the update!! I'll give it a .01 if I could
I really dislike this new update. It’s not user friendly. Please change the feed back to the way it was.
Lost 1.3 billion dollars? Change it back to regular.
Change it back before I just delete it. It’s a terrible update.
They tell me they can’t recover my account because I need authenticator code. And the authenticator app doesn’t even work EITHER! They send me the code to my phone too in a text message and when I type in the code it says “invalide code” it just so frustrating and their website says they can’t help me at all. IM DONE WITH SNAPCHAT! so frustrating!
They went and screwed it up. Latest  update and format change made it impossible to use, extremely hard to follow friends stories. Why mess with a good thing?!.... you guys really screwed up this time
the new update is horrible
The new update is horrible in every way.
Snapchat has been a revolutionary app. It has helped me do tons of things, and used to entertain me for hours on end. However, taking away chronological order and replacing it with the discover page (which includes ads) is NOT good. While it may impress older investors, the vast majority of the community was only annoyed and angered by this. Taking things out of chronological order was the dumbest thing this company has ever done. At least leave an option to organize stories the way most people want them to be.
Snapchat obviously controls what reviews get posted so that the complaints about how horrible the new stories are won’t be seen it’s pretty repulsive
I don’t like it
The update makes me look at peoples stories I don’t want to look like and the discovery page is so cluttered I can’t find the things I actually want to look at.
I like the app a lot no reason to lie but it keeps closing out by itself , it runs pretty slow and the new platform is kinda confusing
It’s so wack Snapchat should fire the person who created the new app I don’t even use it no more if it doesn’t change I’m deleting the app period
new update is so bad
Worst update ever
New update is whack don’t download
The update has made it so disorganized I have stopped using it
Hate the update that changed everything, used to be more organized and user friendly but not now. Have not used since they changed it and don’t plan on using it again. (Also I tried avoiding the update, by not updating, yet it did it on its own which makes me mad)
I’m confused on how the app has lost tons of users and has went down to a 1.8 out of five rating and the app still looks the same. I would change it before the app becomes complete ghost and nonexistent
Y’all got some monkeys working up at Snapchat headquarters????? I mean I kinda understand why you guys did that tho, you want us to press on stories more so you guys get more advertising views and make more money, but keep it up someones going to hates this app so much that another app will surface that’s better and more convenient and than you’ll be making no money :)
The new format doesn't let anyone enjoy using Snapchat. It's too cluttered. Change it back please
Not sure why they changed it, but the new updates make it confusing to find stories and view them in your inner circle and make it way too easy to watch "celebrity" snaps I don't care to follow or see. 😒 I miss the chat page separate from viewing stories. To be honest this app has always been confusing to me switching between screens to find your settings, chat with someone, creating a long chain of snaps in one story, but this latest update makes it even worse! I personally don't get the bitmoji aspect and don't want to download another app just to use it in Snapchat, I'd rather see it built in to this app. 
Change it back ! Or I'm uninstalling it for good . Lots of us are .
I don’t like the new update I hope u guys see this bye
I understand things need to be updated and two things that were good from the update are the multiply text & different writing.  But the way it’s set up NO ONE LIKES IT PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK !!!! 
This app is become paid advertising. Why don't you just charge me for taking pictures because that's the next step.
I love Snapchat and the reason why I’m giving it one star is because I’ve turned off my phone plenty of times and deleted Snapchat and came back and the new update isn’t there. It’s been what a week since it updated? This pisses me off. I just want the fonts.
Everything was going good then this new update all my streaks are gone!
ANNOYING AND SO STUPID UPDATE.
I hate the new update 😐 I almost text someone trying to watch their story 🙄
The new Snapchat update is terrible, can you please bring back the original snapchat.
I’ve had snap deleted for 2 weeks now cause the update is trash, bad move as I haven’t heard one person who LIKES it
The update makes me use the app LESS! I use to snap everyday but I hate how it looks and how it is. I pray you guys go back or I’m more than likely going to delete the app
Why on earth would they change the settings and layout when it was fine! Do NOT update if you have the option! Total waste!!!! :(
This app only appeals to people who think they’re “trendy” or whatever. Don’t download it if you want to be a good person.
The new update is pretty trash
The new update makes it much more difficult to see your friends snap stories. I do not care about the new big discover page with ads and gossip stories for 14 year olds. I’m there to engage with people who follow me and people I follow. The new update makes it much more difficult to do so. Looks like I’m going to start really building my instagram instead.
Completely ruined the app and everything it had going so sad
The ads and clickbait are getting ridiculous and the app has become way too layered and bulky
I've gotten used to this new update and I've given it a chance, I'm trying to like it but I just don't. I really do not enjoy using snapchat like I used to, I haven't watched stories since the update, and I've lost a number of streaks. Please please please update Snapchat to a newer version of the old one:(
The update has made me and so many of my friends stop using Snapchat all together
This update is terrible but my least favorite part is that for group snaps you have to tap the group name to see the snap and for individual snaps you have to tap the picture to the left of the persons name. Why isn’t this consistent regardless of if it’s a group snap or an individual one?? There are plenty other new features I don’t like, but that one annoys me the most. I’ll be using Instagram stories until further notice, as it’s much less of a complete mess.
So I made a bad review on the previous update, and the fact that y’all managed to make it WORSE with this new update deserve and updated review.. I like the rainbow text and all but now it’s just hard to use, it looks cluttered, and I can’t move a text without another text box popping up. Pls go back to the original (keep the rainbow and glow text though) and make it less of a pain to use again
You have thousands of reviews here, yet you haven’t addressed any of the issues. Listen to the feedback. Or keep it they way it is any continue to enjoy loosing $1.3B when celebrities tweet about how horrible this new update is.
I loved Snapchat until the new update came out and the whole layout and format changed now I hate using it and can barely use it correctly
I just find it funny how y’all don’t listen to what your users have to say about the terrible updates.. that’s why no one buys your stocks or those lame geo tags ! Can u please take into consideration what your users and what your reviews say ! Stop updating and making it worst and please just L I S T E N to us !!
It’d be nice if you could upload videos without the quality being terrible
For some reason I am not able to change my front for the styles and my Snapchat is updated to the latest update can someone please help me...?
The new update ruined the app
Everything was great until they dreamed up this disaster of an update.  Go home Snapchat. You’re drunk.
Terrible.
So i have an iPhone 8 Plus and I don’t know if it’s the type of phone that I have but I can’t change the captions. I’ve updated my snap twice and it still won’t change.
Change it back...
Snapchat was a pretty well developed app at first but the update has made it very complicated and now I’m on the fence of uninstalling it because no one uploads anything anymore 😂
While I have always loved Snapchat to talk with my friends and family, I absolutely cannot stand the new update.  It is a terrible layout, can’t find half the people I want to talk to anymore because of people bumping other people that used to stay at my top, accidentally playing someone’s story that I had no intention to open because of how they just roll into one another now.  It is just the dumbest update to a great app I have ever seen to date!  What’s worse is that you have gotten so many bad reviews, emails, called out on instagram and Facebook by celebrities over how awful it is and yet you continue to choose to do NOTHING about it.  The people that live this app and are reaching out to you to fix it will eventually get tired of waiting and will find the next big app to over take this one.  #newlayoutnewapp #makesnapchatoriginal
It’s widely used around the world, so if you want to keep up with the new trends and stuff, snapchat is one of them. The only problems is snapchat frequently glitches and crashes. Also if snapchat wants to make their app 90% better and more useful PLEASE make a streaks button. I don’t know why the snapchat creators haven’t already, but seriously just make a button that sends 1 picture to all your streaks.
If you aren’t going to change the update back at least let us change our usernames
My snap keeps taking me out the app when I try to send a snap to my streaks
I really don’t like this update at ALL! I’m considering just deleting my whole Snapchat until they bring the old one back or do something with this once cause i honestly hate it !
Loved it before the update! It’s so unorganized now. It makes me watch people’s stories I don’t care about, it makes it harder to ignore people’s snaps for later. Overall just a mess so I’ve decided to go back to texting.
Hey snapchat duckers! Thank you for your update which made my decision a lot easier of quitting you ducking service and battery consuming application. 
Every time I got on Snapchat it would freeze and turn black then go back to my home screen
Not many people can really access other people's stories so the whole app is just a mess and a waste of storage on my phone. I used to love it and gave past reviews before which were high reviews but now as you can see your ratings have gone and I don't know why you refuse to put the old Snapchat back
Snap use to be like that but then that update Came An it became trash. It was suppose to be reverted back on the 20th but it’s still on the trash update. #ChangeSnapBack
Ever since the update, my Snapchat has continued to glitch out and crash. My streaks will all have timers despite sending them twice a day and sometimes they’ll disappear for a couple of days , and then reappear. What’s also common is the app crashes in the middle of taking/sending a picture.
This new update is trash . Change it back , this update made the app complicated and basic as fucc and not  fucc with able . Let’s just say if the kik app came back with a camera feed that would dope . Snapchat you done fucced up
Update is booty juice. Pls change. Thanks ! <3
This update ruined my Snapchat experience & I will be using another app.
the update is gay
The update you’ve made hasn’t been a success. You need to find a way where snapchat is enjoyable again. Your losing support and users by it.   Take a hint. 
Why would you update this already working app... absolutely trash. #BoycottSnapchat
Awful
The update. Seriously. Why is it not fixed? I appreciate the new fonts but the rest is no bueno. I’ve been using snapchat for years and have never been frustrated until now. Please change it!
Rip new Snapchat
snapchat needs to swallow their pride and undo this update.
the update itself has nothing wrong with it. i enjoy how you can see the people’s bitmoji in the chat section. the only problem is that you can only see their story if they’re one of your recents.   i like watching people’s stories, & i only snap my streaks & close friends on snapchat. snapchat, you should change this back on the discover page.   one feature that i thought would be interesting & easy would be to add a “send to streaks” button, so that when your sending your streaks you don’t have to click every name one by one.   also, you should add a feature where you can choose your best friends. some people are just my streaks whom i snap a lot, but my actual friends may not even be on my best friend list because my streaks are taking those up. i don’t need my streaks to be my best friends, i need my actual friends to so i can easily snap them back and forth.  i hope you take this into consideration 😉 
Every time I try to sign in to my Snapchat it says cannot connect. All of my friends tried to help me.  And it feels like we have tried every trick in the book. Plz help someone! I hate this app now
ياخي رجعوا الابديت القديم
U should take the old Snapchat update and put it back because this new accessory no one really needs a secession for stories,groups,all its to much but don’t takeaway the Bitmoji update its really nice how u guys gave it more options
As if they couldn’t make it any worse from their previous update, they made it even more difficult to chat. You can no longer swipe right to access chats. Ugh
Difficult user interface, and less interaction with your friends or follower base, because people are less willing to go through stories now.  Difficult to be selective about whose content you view. 
Hate the new update!!!
I’m not sure what the thought process of the developers was when they were thinking this new update would be good but I’m curious to know.  This is probably the worst possible thing you could have done to the app.  It is borderline impossible to use now.  Why would it be a good idea to take the snap that was perfectly fine, easy to use, and loved by everyone, and completely change it and do things nobody asked for.  Just mind boggling.  I haven’t been able to watch stories anymore.  It seems like you’re making it less and less controlled by the user and forcing them to look at ads and prohibiting them from choosing desired stories to view.  Extremely disappointed.
We will not get use to this tacky layout bring back the old one! Every time I get on Snapchat I want to leave a negative review. It was doing so well it was one of the best social media apps now people don’t even want to open the app. Think about it how can it go from over 4 stars to now 1 BECAUSE IT’S HORRIBLE!!!!
Snapchat was one of my favorite apps!! It’s always been really glitchy and annoying so sometimes when you need to capture the perfect moment on snap it can’t happen. Especially after the update it’s literally impossible to figure out and your stories don’t get any views
Worse than its Stock index
Everything is confusing now.
I can’t believe that they won’t reverse it back to the older version, because this new one is so bad!
I like this app but you guys gotta fix the timing of the streaks because I’ve been losing streaks recently and it hasn’t been 24 hrs yet for any of them pls fix this
I thought updates make things better!
10/10 do not recommend anymore. New update isnt good and makes snapchat very hard and inconvenient. It is much harder to view stories and snapchat people back. In my opinion an update was not needed, snapchat was great and I’m not sure why they changed the app. If I didn't care about my streaks, I would delete it because of this new update. Snapchat told us to wait and get used to it, but it’s been over a month and every one i know hates it
With the new updates the Snapchat became more confusing and more laggy  I went from an android to iPhone for couple reasons and one of them was a good Snapchat quality cause I use it on a daily basis. But even with a brand new iPhone it’s almost same as android quality.  Frequently gets stuck on one page and frustrates me.  This is where I ask myself if I even need Snapchat now. 
i honestly don’t even use snapchat any more because the update has made it so bad. the design used to be simple and easy to use, but now, it’s become over complicated and so much worse. snapchats move down in the feed before i get a chance to reply to them. they don’t show up in chronological order. wanted to see someone’s story? sorry, you can barely find your own! the old snapchat design was iconic and minimalistic, but now it just feels like getting punched in the eyeballs.
Mixing stories with chat was an awful idea. So was mixing people I follow with random other people I don’t so that those posts/stories/ads get more views. I have completely stopped using the app for anything other than messaging a small handful of friends at this point and that’s only because they haven’t moved on to something else and Snapchat is (barely now) better than Facebook messaging which I just will not use. I have zero interest in the discover tab, and would like the stories separated from my chat. Including people of interest that I follow.
I downloaded the app so I can watch the videos everyone posts. How am I supposed to do that when, the videos are moved & now they won’t load. This app went from fun & funny to stupid in 1 update. Apps getting deleted. Won’t be back.
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Please fix this new update! I am so tired of watching stories that I didn’t even subscribe to. And then no matter how many times I get rid of them, more come. It’s like never ending. It’s driving me nuts! I don’t even use Snapchat anymore and I’m considering getting rid of it. I can’t stand it anymore.
Since the new update (early 2018) my usage of Snapchat has dropped dramatically. As I’m sure you’re aware the new interface they have is a jumbled mess of stories, private snaps, and friends all on one page. It’s hard to distinguish what is going on without having to seriously look through the entire left hand page.   I’ve read that Snapchat pushed this update to make it easier for marketers to be noticed. Snapchat has a hard time making money and they’re doing anything possible to change that. I think that Snapchat has prioritized making money over their users, and that is a shame. 
The new update is HORRIBLE!
This update is horrible. I got used to it but then Snapchat started to act up. I’m sending my streaks but I’m still loosing streaks with people even though they’re also sending back as well. I have two friends on my best friend list but it has the emoji claiming that I’m on their best friends list but not on mine when they CLEARLY are. I’m mainly upset about my streaks though because I’ve been doing them forever but it takes Snapchat forever to make the timer go away and sometimes it doesn’t which is highly annoying. Also when my friend texts me I can’t find them and if someone sent me a text I can’t find them easily but I have to search their name and I don’t know if they texted me or not since I have a lot of friends on my Snapchat. I don’t like how the stories make the friends name go up at the top as well as the texts because it’s very confusing. Also I can’t send videos to my friends on Snapchat anymore. I used to love Snapchat and I used to be on it 25/8 and I still am but I don’t like this app anymore. I might just have to get everyone’s number and like never use Snapchat again if it wants to act up like this because this is ridiculous.
👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
Lost my days streaks even though I been snapping them every days makes me mad ever since this update
I hate the update everything is clutter looking like a whole mess fix it Jesus!!! Take this L
we’re waiting for you to change the update, lets go, please. 
this update is completely confusing me i don’t like how stories and snapchats are all on one page if i could give zero stars i would.
Worst update yet, YES I'm complaining like a middle aged white women but who cares. I suggest everyone delete this app and move to Instagram stories.
Seriously...what’s going on?
Snapchat is an awesome app. Update: snapchat was an awesome. Update again: I can't even open the app anymore!!! It got really weird
Why change?! Oh yeah because you wanted to input more ads while forcing us to watch stories on a different page. Money hungry @s*holes. I've never done my IG stories but I finally decided to make the switch. Congrats Snapchat :)
Stupidest redesign ever.  Gonna sell my stock in this company and delete this app for good unless they change this stupid design. Bc no one likes it!!!!
اتمنى الرجوع للسناب القديم
These new snapchat updates are the worst ever thought of.  Bring the old stories back.
Everybody and their moms hate the new update. I miss how there was separate sections for stories and for the conversation and that stupid but interesting discover section that I used often...now it’s hard to find people’s stories. And once you watch the story it disappears. I like watching people’s story and then sometimes later on in the day when I’m bored I just go to the stories section and just go through and rewatch everyone’s story again. And also I hate how the stories and the convos are all on one section because I hate seeing everyone’s name in the “convo” section so what I would do when my convo section was filling up I would just go to my settings and press clear all. Now there’s no button that says clear all. I have to do it one by one. And if I cleared a persons name it also cleared their stories. And there’s no way to go back and look at it. And also I can’t find the friends list that y’all used to have! I think with this update you guys were trying to make it simple for us...but to be honest the old one was more easier and organized to work with. This new update, everything all thrown and cluttered onto one page and it’s just frustrating. Whenever you guys updated the app and add new things to it or changed it up a little bit I would immediately adapt to it and I thought I would get use to it after using it for a while but I can’t. Nobody can. The newest update does help a little bit but I just really hate how the stories and the convos are all together on one page and how the stories disappear after viewing them. idk if you can change it back to how the way it use to be but Is there anyway you guys can possibly make it similar to that. Or at least make the conversations on a separate tab and stories and group all on separate tabs??? And make the stories appear after I have already watched them and even if I deleted the conversation please snapfam💛          Sincerely,       Some snap homie 
Snapchat used to be my favorite app but now it's a pain to use. This new update highlights unnecessary celebrities stories as well as articles that I don't care to read. All I wanted to do is view my friends' stories and communicate with them. I truly hope they un-do this update.
Seriously, if you want to make the drastic changes and truly think it's for the better do it on a different app. Make an S2 or something. Or is not that perhaps reload the old version add "Snapchat Classic" - or keep down this trail, keep alienating users, and go the way of Myspace.
Swallow your pride undo the update
Snapchat is amazing but the new update is horrible and confusing. It’s very difficult to deal with and is all over the place. It’s very unorganized. Nothing is in alphabetical order anymore and it does not show all of the new stories on our timeline. Please go back to the previous version of Snapchat PLEASE
I hate this update 😒
التحديث خلاني ما انزل شي ولا اتابع خد لانو كتير سيئ 😤
After the most recent updates....trash
Old Snapchat ✋🏽
😡
I hate to say that the last update is so bad and makes me hate Snapchat,,, it is not just complicated but it totally wrong snap used to be easy and fun but it’s not anymore am losing my data to see things that am not interested to it at the moment and when I want to look for someone I need to send him massage to be on my lest you need to figure out what is the problem and try to solve it out before it gets late you going to lose the reputation that you build by sticking to this update
I hate this app now.
hate how cluttered it is now. Snaps with mssgs. Horrible. I hardly ever use it now. I didn't ask for this stupid update
I love Snapchat I have used it since I can remember. But ever since the newest update it has been impossible for me for add people from group stories and it is being very slow and it glitches when you don’t have full service but other than that I love it
Get normal snapchat app back this update is boring.
I hate that the stories aren’t in chronological order. Even once you’ve watched them it has no clear order. They supposedly separated the celebrities from your friends but some of my friends are on the “celebrity” side. Can we at least get it in alphabetical order. Or just change it back
The latest update to snapchat is the worst update for me, and since SnapChat is determined not to change the new design , i think a lot of users will stop using it.  ** When updating snapchat 4 days ago problem appeared which is frozen application during the review of stories and then close the app on its self . I removed and installed Snapchat 2 time but I still have the same problem. I hope there will be a new update to solve this problem. 
Seriously just go back to he old design. The majority of users don’t like this new tile layout.
My stories and chats DO NOT need to be together, thanks.
The new update is very very bad I don’t like it at all it’s so complicated.. please return back the old snap chat
i barely use the app anymore, i hate it so much i cant use it!
Really loved the app but I can’t even stand to use it because of the new update. Please fix it 😩
So I’ve had this update for a while now and I still hate it... it’s so cluttered and so hard to find people that I actually talk to. Please put the stories on their own page again!!! I did not get used to the update like some said I might and now I barely use the app ...
What were they thinking with this new UI update. it’s so ugly!
The new update ruins the app.
Awful ‘update’. Constantly crashes on my iPhone 7. Never had this problem prior.
Not only is the update obnoxiously messy and and unwanted but also I’ve been having a lot of glitches especially when I had a 100 and something streak with someone. We know the rules of how to get a streak and Snapchat glitches out for the both of us. When I asked nicely if they can fix there mistake they said they couldn’t which I know for a fact is not true. So if you like all those annoying things download the app, if you already have it delete it , and If you still haven’t gotten it yet, DONT!      -Sincerely someone who used to love the app 
Not only did this update ruine my life, but it ruined every aspect of my social life. I hate the new update and only use Snapchat once a day. I used to check it 1,000 times a day (joking). I hate the update. Change it back. I will stop using snapchat.  P.S. I probably have the longest streak on Snapchat so please give me a trophy.   Happy days,  Andrea Alfaro 
From someone who used to use snapchat on the daily -   This snapchat update was more inconsiderate to us users than you may have anticipated. Yes, everything is now on one page, that’s kinda helpful. But why on earth did you think going out of chronological order would make things better?? It didn’t work for instagram and it’s not working for you. Second, literally everything about how it works is difficult to use and confusing. Everything seems to be more complexed to accomplish. Me and the rest of the fellow unhappy snapchat users plead and hope that change snapchat back or modify your version a lot.   really do love y’all, but this was the worst thing you guys have ever done. 
Why is Snapchat not returning to the original Snapchat you know the one where you could view Snapchat stories in ACTUAL ORDER of what time they were posted ????? Not the Snapchat I’m missing out on most stories of my friends stories unless I search for them specifically..
This New Update just lost the fun and originality it once had with this new layout in the most recent update! #bringbackthe oldsnapchat i hope snapchat sees this!
Snapchat really needs to undo this update. I don’t usually write a review for anything but I just had to this time because of the update I’m even considering deleting my account soon if it doesn’t get fixed. Remember what happened to MySpace, Snapchat. Don’t share the same fate
Things have got to change. We didn’t ask for this new update, and we don’t want it. Please please please go back. No one likes this. It’s dumb.
Loved Snapchat till a few weeks ago when they decided to change their user interface. Go back to the old ways pls!!👎🏻👎🏻 
Please go back to the old Snapchat
The new update just ruined it for me
You claim that it’ll take time for everyone to adjust to the update, but it’s literally the dumbest update ever for any app. Nothing flows, everything is confusing and now you have to do more, just to achieve the simplest of tasks. We don’t need time to adjust to this, y’all just need to make the app more functional or “user friendly”. I’ve literally only snapped once since this update. Like why is MY story on the same page as my friend request???? That’s dumb. Why are my messages mixed in with my timeline????? Even more dumb. Who at this company approved of this update?!?! They need to be fired. This is horrendous.
THIS UPDATE GOTTA GO. 😂 I don’t even know who’s replying to me, or let alone know when I get a message since it’s all on one side. Discover feature is pointless. Bring it back. The usernames get mixed up. Sometimes you can’t swipe up from stories. It gotta go. It’s too much.
Snapchat used to be great now it’s on its way to being forgotten like MySpace since the dumb update
Whyyyyy this new update is cluttered and looks messy and awful. WHY FIX WHAT ISNT BROKEN
Sometimes it takes a while for my stickers to load like gifs,Time, bitmojis, even my cut out stickers so I don’t know what’s going on please fix it
Was a big fan and deleted the app after the update. Was already mad I could no longer see how long a story was but this new interface took the cake. Beginning of their downfall I presume
My snap is so slow. It crashes all the time. Don’t even get me started on the new layout. completely different, not pleasing at all. Hate how famous snaps are on completely different pages and how other people I didnt even follow show up🙄🙄🙄
I am deleting Snapchat until this update is removed. update: i tried to give SC another chance and now i can’t even take PICTURE. that’s the entire effin point! RIDICULOUS! 
Snapchat used to be my most used app. The update ruined it. Cluttered confusing hard to understand. Not worth it!
Can't find friends I'm looking for and recent messages disappear
Change the update
The new update feels like I’m using more data and to much for my phones processor. It’s not convenient.
LOVE SNAP, HATE UPDATE !
Love Snapchat but the new update is trash
For the love of god at least bring back chronological order.
My phone crashes at least five times a day… And it never crashes until I open Snapchat so if I go to whole day without using the app my phone’s fine that day-I don’t know what it is about Snapchat that my phone can’t handle but… It doesn’t stop me from using it I love the app otherwise.
The app is still crap the versions before these two updates was a lot better
Update is obviously making you lose customers go back to old platform
tried getting use to it but it’s just pissing me off more and more every day. I hate snapchat. Instagram stories is where you can find me. 🚫👻🚫👻🚫
There was some new fixes but it’s still all messy 😒
STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP. IT IS HIDEOUS AND CONFUSING AND STUPID. NO ONE LIKES IT. STOP MAKING SNAPCHAT WORSE.   HOW is it remotely logical to put stories on my feed. People that I never talk to but post all the freakin time are taking the spot of people I actually talk to. CHANGE IT. This is stupid are literal children designing this app???  Also the discover page is a mess? All these celeb stories are put in front of stories I actually look at so I have to scroll to try and find what I used to look at. So now I just don’t.   When are you going to start listening to the people that actually use the app???  I wish they'd go back to the snapchat from years ago. Every time they update this app they make it worse! And everyone says that yet they keep doing it. Don't fix what isn't broken! Of course I don't like the new update.   Also the streak filter won't come up for me like 90% of the time.   And I wish there was some way to save a streak. Even if it was like pay 99 cents to save your streak. I totally would. My friend and I had a year long streak going and we lost it. I basically would've done anything to recover it.   Also, I liked swiping. I don't want to tap on discover.  This is so obnoxious.  I used to love discover but now it feels cluttered and confusing. It was so much better how it originally was. As was almost all of Snapchat. 
I hate this new update snapchat use to be the best social media I would use. It was very rude for Snapchat to update itself please go back to the old Snapchat I know and love!
I despise the latest update!  I don't want my recent messages to be down in my list due to new stories being posted by others!  I say separate them again. We don't need less widgets, create another screen to scroll right on instead of jumbling everything into the messages section. 
The update is killing my desire to use Snapchat. I’d rather mosey in over to Instagram and use their story feature. Snapchat you better step up your game or you’ll be a forgotten app along with Vine.
The new update is terrible, cluttered, and seriously slowed down my phone. the fact that the update is pretty much trending, and for all the wrong reasons, should be a BIG red flag for the makers of snapchat. Snapchat is now ugly, hard to use, slower, slows my phone down, and just a pain. if this update doesn't get fixed, i'm seriously considering not using snapchat anymore. And i've had one for 6 years so that is saying A LOT
Still a mess and terrible.
I am a hardcore lover of snapchat but this new update is very annoying and inconvenient and inconsistent. I dont like that you have to watch the stories before you can open the message and that the stories and messages are on the same page . also that it doesnt show you your recents it is very frustrating. i hope you guys go back to the old one .
can you maybe stop putting stories of people I don’t know in the media section? yeah thanks. if I wanted to see their stories, I would follow them. I don’t care about these random people. Don’t care about “popular stories” or “official stories.” And clicking “see less like this” does absolutely nothing. can we also maybe see things we’re subscribed to at the TOP??? I actually like to watch stuff from the dodo, nat geo, and similar stories, but it’s too difficult now as they’re placed BELOW stories of people I DONT KNOW and DONT FOLLOW. In what world does that make sense? You’d think subscribing to something would prioritize it over things you’re not subscribed to but 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️   it’s not the only thing that doesn’t make sense in this ridiculously bad update. 
So Snapchat was awesome up until this new update came up!!! It was my favorite app and now I can’t stand it! Please please bring the old Snapchat back!!!
Now!!!!!
This app keeps me semi connected to a few people, but it’s the biggest pain to interact with. The loud intrusive adds that make their way into my life cause me to close the app every time I use it. Totally annoying app
It’s retarded
I’d give you no stars if I could
Change it back .
The new update is all over the place and now it just got rid of allllll if my streaks!!
This update is horrible & you’re losing money. Revert to the way it used to be.
Barely use anymore
I swear I have updated my snap many times. I have the ugly update, but snapchat refuses to give me the new fonts. The update log says “oh we added some new fonts” but I still don’t have them and everyone else does!
Update is lowkey only for adds
Bring back the old version 🤬😡
Ever since the update everything is slower than cold molasses and navigating the app is a nightmare once my favorite social media outlet now a useless disorganized cesspool
i really liked Snapchat but now this new update got people not wanting to have this app .. change it back to the original 🤦🏾‍♀️ .
Why would I care about the story of some random YouTuber or twitterer Iv never heard. If I’m on the official stories then I wanna see the ones I follow.
I. Hate. This. Format. It’s the worst!!! I hate having to fish through all the random profiles and and posts!!! Where do I find the petition to bring back the old format?!? PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK!!  Ugh, the worst
I love the new update. Some people just need to adapt. People really need to understand that you don't pay for this messaging app. It's free to you and therefore the publisher can edit the app however they like. If you have a hard time adapting to it's recent drastic changes then technology just isn't for you. Catch up! Love this app.
Honestly they made it so much harder for users to navigate through it, in really not sure what their original plan was with this new update but it absolutely backfired.
im having issues with my snapchat stickers loading and my snapchat over all has been glitching. but the update has been fine for me and i am starting to get used to it more.
Snapchat used to be fun and user friendly. It was a simple way to talk to your friends with a selfie or a cop picture. Now Snapchat has updated way too many things, and it is no longer a simple, user friendly app. I am disappointed in Snapchat. :(
Snapchat was good before this bad  update. If the designers of snap is reading this...please change it back to how it was before everybody liked and it was easier to navigate through. However, you can keep the different type of text you can choose we like those. Thank you!
It’s so annoying and bad. Before it was so easy and clean, now it’s a hot mess.
This new update has made it very hard to do the things on Snapchat that it was meant for: simple chats with friends. I can hardly find a chat with any of my friends anymore without having to scroll through tens of stories that I don’t care to see.  I can no longer use my left hand only because tapping on the left side (where the bitmoji is) shows the person’s story or profile not the snap! This is a petty point but seriously it’s annoying.   The iconic symbol that shows whether a snap is opened or closed or screenshot requires a magnifying glass to see.  It’s so hard to find people’s stories without the A-Z scroll.  Nobody cares about Discover!  Interface is over complicated with the bitmoji and looks just plain ugly in my opinion.  Side note: bring back the rainbow coming out of mouth filter from the early days. 
This company clearly does not care about their users. Soooooo many people have come to state how they hate the update, and yet Snapchat isn't listening. Definitely will be using Instagram to post from now on. If Snapchat was smart they would listen to the people who made them popular in the first place and change back!
sorry snapchat but with this update no longer an app i enjoy, it's really not user friendly with the new story set up i only want to see who i want not all these famous people i don't care about + it's hard to stay messaging the people i talk to most
Congratulations on destroying your own app my use of your app has been minimal since the new layout not sure why you ruined a perfectly fine version
Bring back old Snapchat.
CHANGE THIS DADGUM APP BACK NOW. IT HAS BEEN ENOUGH BLOODY EFFING TIME FOR YALL TO GET YOUR SH** TOGETHER AND REMOVE THE BLASTED UPDATE. FOR THE LOVE OF HEAVEN FIX YOUR CRAP. Lawwwwwwwwd. Y’all make me so mad I had to type in caps lock and y’all know it’ll be real when that happens. So fix it. Like yesterday.
Hi, I’ve been a user on Snapchat for quite sometime. I’ve been here almost since day one and with these current updates your trying to push out is destroying my enjoyability for this app. It’s so hard to navigate now, what even is the page that you get after you swipe right when on picture mode, why can I post a story for a group chat (that’s so dumb) I mean please.
Make my life easier and get rid of that old update please!!
If I could rate it 0 Stars, I would. The new update is terrible and it makes me not want to use the app. It needs to go back to what it was before. I used to use Snapchat 24/7 but now the only time I use it is to keep my streaks alive and to be honest, if I didn’t have them I would have deleted the app by now. Regardless of the developers adding the different fonts and gifs, the app is still awful and it needs to go back to how it was before. It is jumbled, confusing, lacking order, and just overall stressful to use now. I’ve used Snapchat for years now and I love the ease and simplicity of the app but this update made everything complicated. I am highly disappointed. It’s also making everyone move away from Snapchat and onto instagram stories now because of this.
We need old version of Snapchat
i really enjoyed snapchat the way it was before this latest update. i even think it could work the way it is now, if the way in which my friends’ names appeared made sense.... the current update puts people i haven’t talked to in weeks above people i talk to every day. i do not understand the algorithm and it discourages me from even wanting to use the app. i’m also having an issue with the quality of my memories. whenever i try to view them they appear in a much lower quality than when i actually took them. i don’t know if this is a software issue or not, but it’s annoying nonetheless. i know this is just an app, and there are way more important things i could be worried about, but your company has already lost millions in market share, so i wouldn’t take this criticism too lightly. just a thought.
So Snapchat is my favorite form of social media, but for the past 4 months it’s been nothing but bugs. The app closes me out whenever I take pictures (this happens occasionally and can last up to a whole day). Also it makes me rewatch stories I’ve already watched. It opens my snapchats without letting me see them (this has only happened twice). The update in general doesn’t have anything to do with it for me, things bugged up before that. I actually love the update but the glitching needs to be fixed. My streaks always disappear too and I always get timers when I don’t actually have timers.
if i could rate it 0 stars i would.
New update makes me want to stop using the app!
snapchat is honestly so horrible right now like i use to do this thing where i slid to open people text to read what it says without opening it and now i cant even do that so sc i no point rn other than streaks because now i barley view stories , so snap can u pleaseee go back to your old update like honestly no one likes the new update so just change it back dude omg
Bring back the old snapchat
The new app is pretty awful, how on earth can you completely ruin a once perfect easy to use UI, to a cluttered, confusing mess. Return back the old Snap!
The update was awful in every way possible. I hate the app now. Can you remove the update please?
This is the first review I’ve ever left for an app. Because it is literally thee worse. It’s cluttered and loses its functionality and the simplicity that made using Snapchat so universal and effortlessly. Now it’s a headache to use and cultivates a lack of desire to view stories... I hope you guys change it back. There’s beauty in simplicity
Ive been using snapchat since it first came out. I use snapchat the most thats where I talk to all my friends family etc.. but ever sonce the new update I dont even use it anymore probably going to delete the app off my phone honestly whats the point anymore!?! I lost all of my streaks because of the new update it messed my whole snapchat up its not even fun to use anymore! I love snapchat just like everyone else but that new update was such a sh*tty move 💩👎🏼 I hate it now i dont even open the app and im not the only one 💯 kylie jenner stated it on twitter she dont use it either 🤦🏼‍♀️ can you please fix it!!! I miss the old snapchat where the stories didnt show up when you hot a snapchat and where i had all my streaks thats the worst part and makes me so mad i took my streaks serious 💯 and you guys seriously need to re-evaluate the app and put it back to how it was your reviews are bad because of the new update!!! You dont care obviously 🙄👎🏼 thats why instead of 5 stars you got less than 2 😂 im waiting for someone to create a new app that will replace snapchat till you fix it!!!! Take your users advice and put it back to how it was it would be GREATLY APPRECIATED k thanks 😌👌🏼
All I have to say is ...... the new update isn’t my favorite thing.... so I won’t be using it until it’s changed:(
I really loved Snapchat but now it’s always freezing and my snaps aren’t being received 😞
Believe me I love snapchat but the new update with the fonts and all won’t work all my friends have it and I’ve updated snap and my phone as well but it doesn’t seem to want to give me the fonts or anything
This new update is difficult to use and an eye sore. In addition, my Snapchat has never cause me problems before, but now it is constantly crashing and glitching! Please fix this.
I have gotten used to the new update but that does not mean it's easier to use. It's annoying and diaorganized. Snapchat be slacking.
I use to like the old Snapchat and i hardly use it now that’s it’s got this update i truly hate i want it back to the way it was.
Everything was amazing easily 5 stars. Now after the update everything’s changed. My snaps don’t load. Pictures don’t load. Stuff in chats don’t lead. It’s not the WiFi convection either. I tried with/without WiFi plus a hotstop and same results. I now rate it a 1 star and it’s very frustrating. I started texting which I never did because it’s way more easy now.
I Can’t get the fonts plz how can I get them
They took the format that was so simplistic and beautiful and turned it into an ad wasteland. There is an entire page dedicated to pointless and irrelevant stories. They then moved the stories to the main messaging page, making it into to a cramped and confusing mess. Fix it snap before it’s too late.                     Love,                             Timmy xoxo 
A recent mandatory update completely screwed over this app. Took away everything that made it great now it's unbelievably trash
The last version is just baaaaaad!
The update is so whack. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone because the update is THAT bad.
Hello Snapchat i am sorry to bother you but can you please change Snapchat back i don’t like the new update and mine is really glitchey
Actually deleted the app after three years of nonstop, daily use. 40000 snaps later, and this update is horrendous. Couldn’t stand it.
Stories are hard to find. The app is set up terribly now. You can’t even swipe to chat anymore, you have to hold down a button and click chat! This app was loved for its convenience and easiness to use and now it’s all ruined. Please bring back the old update. PLEASE
I beg you to please go back to having the stories SEPARATE from the individually sent snaps. The section with “popular stories” and others that we genuinely do not care about is extremely useless. I use Snapchat SIGNIFICANTLY less than I used to because of this terrible update. Just go back to how it was before with the addition of the new text options, and new Bitmoji update. The rest is completely awful.
The CEO is crazy standing by this update.
This Update Is TRASH . Throw The Whole APP Away 😒. Use To Be My Favorite App . I Abandoned Facebook & This Stupid Update Just Irritates Me 😒
New update sucks❗️ hopefully there’s a way to get the old version back . we’ve tried everything . 🙄
I can’t deal with the new update.it doesn’t allow you to peek into a chat, it strait opens the chat like BAM. I don’t know what to do because I want to see what they said I just don’t want to open their message and feel obliged to reply. Anyways I’m ride or die for Snapchat but it’s really putting our relationship to the test.
I used to love snapchat then they updated it and it is HORRIBLE now. What’s even worse is seeing the lack of care snapchat has for their millions of users. We have all made it very clear how awful this update is and weeks later NOTHING has changed. I will never redownload this app.
I use this everyday, but the update is horrible. Please fix it. It made it harder to use.
This update is worse than any update for any other app I've ever had. It's cluttered, unorganized, and is basically just one huge eyesore. It's unnecessarily complicated, and they decided to try to fix something that wasn't broken.  To make matters worse, they're completely ignoring their users. At least 90% of their users HATE this update and have made their feelings clear, yet all snapchat has had to say was "it may take some settling in." Bye, snapchat.  UPDATE: Now whenever someone tries to add me, it won't let me add them back. And then they just disappear completely. Get it together, snapchat. 
I’ve been disappointed lately with Snapchat and this was the last straw. I won’t use Snapchat anymore unless they change the format back to what it was.
This use to be a good app until the update they need to change it back
This update is the worst it looks bad. And I don’t even know who opened my streaks anymore. Also they don’t all send and it’s driving me crazy.
I don’t like the new update no one does change it back! I hate the update I’m going to stop using Snapchat if you don’t change it back.
Fix your horrible app. That’s all there is to it🤷🏾‍♀️😂like I don’t even use sc anymore soooo many people are done and just using Instagram dms, Twitter, and messages more now like Snapchat has no more use it’s not fun anymore they messed it all up. Good luck to you guys making profits because without people using your app...😂😂😭well... YOUR’RE BROKE so🙂
Absolutely awful update. Its impossible to navigate.
BRING BACK BESTFRIENDS . It's dumb that it’s gone also THE NEW UPDATE IS HORRIBLE STOP TRYING TO CATER TO COMPANIES AND FAMOUS PEOPLE I DONT CARE ABOUT THEM
The new update is terrible. It makes me never want to use it anymore.
The new update is trash. So confusing! You guys could’ve done better. So complicated compared to before..
This app keeps glitching and it messes up my previously saved videos, it won’t let me watch them at all.
I used to love this app, but after the new update it went downhill soo fast. It’s super buggy and always crashes, it tells me I’ve lost streaks and then 2 days later the streaks come back, and not to mention the update is hideous!! Do better Snapchat...
To be quite honest, I love using Snapchat. However, this update is really obviously a money grabber.   The user experience is totally ruined for those who like to view all stories. In addition, the money grabbing part is apparent as hell with the subscription part being the first things you see when you swipe left. This is really sad considering many people used Snapchat for the nice interface.   I mean you can sell out to companies, but how many of your users left for Instagram already? 
I’m deleting this app because it turned into trash and it’s not user friendly.
This is one of my favorite social media apps. ❤️
I used to love the app, but then the new update and bitmoji ruined everything. I’m honestly super upset about it.
Can you please change Snapchat back how it was. I honestly don't like this new update I liked the other one. It's not the same I just like the other one better to be honest.
the update is horrible, everything's out of order and you can't even see certain people's stories by choice anymore. if you go to find someone's story it opens up a chat with them. give us the old snapchat back :( i'm about to delete this app altogether
Used to use it EVERYDAY! Unfortunately the new update is not something I enjoy. It is not convenient AT ALL to have the celeb stories mixed with articles AND celebs I’m not even following! If I’m not following someone it’s for a reason. Very sad to say I don’t find myself clicking on Snapchat anymore. Debating on deleting or not. Hoping they fix this asap.
Change it back like it's mad confused but keep all the ways you can change the words and stuff. Y'all have like a average of 1 stars why haven't y'all updated it? You losing money
The worst update in all history, the application is now very laggy , trashhhh
Why every time I try and get into Snapchat, you guys kick me out?!? Fix it!! I have an IPhone 6s and instead of the great camera quality, I’m getting Android quality with the camera instead!!
Accidentally updated and this UI is one of the worst designed I've ever used. The old design worked perfectly, so I do not understand why you would break it. I get that a company needs innovation but this move was cocky and miscalculated. The refusal to listen to consumers is stubborn idiocy and arrogance.
trash update it’s so unorganized and messy
YOU ALL BLEW IT WITH THIS NEW UPDATE. IT’S TRASH! I CAN’T KEEP UP WITH RECENT CONVERSATIONS, I HATE SEEING EVERYONE’S STORY IN MY FACE 24/7, THERE’S NO REASON I SHOULD BE HAVING TO SCROLL DOWN 30 TIMES JUST TO FIND SOMEONE I WAS TALKING EARLIER TODAY! TEAM SNAPCHAT FIX THIS !!!!! ASAP
I hate the new update.
THE NEW UPDATE IS TRASH, GARBAGE, FIXX IT
I love love Snapchat not i hate it. It’s annoying i can’t seem to figure out how to watch all the people and celebrities i follow. Please go back to the old Snapchat.
I really liked Snapchat before but the update is so inconvenient they say it’s to make things easier for you friends but I had ZERO problem keeping it “personal” now it’s all on the left side chats mixed with stories. And you had to scroll through all the open chats let alone everyone’s stories. I don’t want to see everyone’s stories every time I open a chat I just want to see the chat. They stand firm on their decision to keep the update I’ll stand firm on going against it. Instagram is better anyway.
Lost my streaks for no reason, no hour glass for either person. Snapchat has been bad and screwy ever since the update
Nothing was wrong with the old snapchat. I don’t understand why they had to ruin it. I’ve taken my talents to Instagram stories now.
Forcing unsolicited content down my throat!!!!Snap has been on a down ward spiral for the last couple years but I think they've finally reached their lowest point. Won't be using the app as much, Instasnap is much better
I really dislike the latest update. The discover page is too cluttered and there is no easy way to follow friends stories. I give it a big 👎🏻
This app use to be great. Now i can’t look at all my stories, nothing loads anymore, and it looks like crap. This app is trash now. This app is one big bug. Please fix it
if i could leave zero stars i would. i'm serious. the only reason it has one star is because i don't have the option to take all two of snapchats stars and put them where they belong. in the garbage. i hate the new snapchat update and i hate whoever came up with it and i wish snapchat would admit to their mistake and just fix this. leave ur pride somewhere and fix this. please.
bs
Hate this new update everyone is starting to delete Snapchat cus of it too :,( the stories were better off in the other page. please bring the old Snapchat back.
This update is starting to make sense now I just don’t have the fonts 🤦🏽‍♂️
You guys need to swallow your pride and undo this hideous update. It’s trash. Nobody even goes on Snapchat anymore only for streaks you need to undo this.
Snapchat is garbage
The new version is terrible! Please go back to the way the app used to run.
It’s so annoying how every time I type something out, as soon as I move the text up, it goes right in the trash! So annoying and it gets tiring having to type everything out again! Such a disappointment!
I love Snapchat I’ve had it for years and I love the new updates. My biggest dislike is how the stories Got moved from Discover to your first page I hate that. I don’t want to be notified when my friends have updated their story I don’t care for that. Another thing I don’t like is when you snap a certain friend and if I don’t respond or if they don’t respond it moves to the bottom of the list then I feel like we’re not friends anymore  I don’t like that. One last thing is that the Bitmoji that came out that’s like 3-D if I change the outfit it doesn’t change it when I use the Bitmoji filter and dances or what not.
i have an iphone 7 & it says it’s updated but i don’t have the gif stickers🤨
Need to change the update, it's not good.
Why do people have to try and fix things that are already perfect. Honestly my thinking of deleting the app I don’t even use it any more. I used to love watching all the entertainment stories. But now all I get is dumb stories about people idc about. Tbh I don’t even use it to text. Let alone watch my friends stories.
Okay so as we are all getting used to the new update I really just want the old snap back. Is the snapchat company just gonna pretend that it doesn’t need to go back? The update is just too cluttered and it makes me not see stories. Sometimes I send people the wrong snap to someone because when I click on someone it changed to a different person because I guess they just posted on their story ugh it just needs to go back!!!!! I miss it so much
This new update TERRIBLE !!!!!!!!!
Very bad update
How many billions do you insist on losing before just putting the app back how almost everyone has asked you? No one will care what you do with the app once the have deleted it and written it off for the next trend. Be smart. What’s taking so long to go back? Are you set on going bankrupt or?
I just like everyone else want the old Snapchat back. I sometimes Snapchat the wrong people because of this update. It is truly terrible, why have you done this? Maybe the app is getting bad reviews because you won’t listen to the people. We the people, give us that good good. Old Snapchat. This app use to be good. It can be better and become good once again but you guys, the app developers, need to change it back to the way it was. Sometimes change is good, sometimes it is bad, in this case you changing it was terrible. Bring back the Snapchat we love, the good Snapchat, the best Snapchat. Please listen to us.
You guys should make it where we can tag people in pictures and videos with the @ symbol
Snapchat new update👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼 not much to say about it
I have a love-hate relationships with streaks. They can be cool but sometimes they are annoying. Also the update is slightly dumb. I’ll be scrolling through stories and then I see something cool and wanna do back to it but then forget who the hecks story I just saw. With that being said, it’s the primary form of communication between teens/highschoolers and rightfully so.
this new update is cluttered and junky. it’s terrible to use, and it makes me not wanna use the app. honestly, if i didn’t have streaks with so many people i’d delete it. i hope you listen to your users and fix this awful update
I used Snapchat every single day before this stupid update came along and ruined it. They have made finding the stories I actually subscribe to and follow nearly impossible to see. It seems like most users preferred Snapchat before the update so developers and app executives should take note. The new update won't matter if no one uses the app anymore!
Look at your ratings! There are at least 3 times more people who put 1 star than people who put 5 stars!!! Your new update...stinks! It was so much easier before! Maybe do snaps and chats on the same page with group chats on another little file, and than do stories and discover on the other page. This stuff that suggests that you look through other people stories is really annoying too.
I love snap chat but snap please stop taking away the good filters !!!!! All I’m asking is you bring back the pink flower filter and keep it as an original thank you !!!
It makes my phone battery percent go down very quickly 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
New update is crap. Way too confusing for no reason. Stories and messages should not be together who even thought of this crap. Was great. Uninstall.
Was awesome. My favorite app. Couldn’t get me off it. Now the update has ruined it. I can’t keep up with incoming snaps and stories. It’s. A mess. @snapchat fix this
This app was so good until they ruined it with that update and then they made it worse when they changed it so you can switch between chats, stories and groups because now you can’t slide into the conversation. Why Snapchat? Why can’t you just change it back to the original version everyone loves??? Please
The new update makes the app worse. There are zero improvements. The app still drains battery at an alarming rate and now it’s just harder to use. I’ve all but stopped using the app because it’s a hassle.
I hate the new update. Bring the old one back!
This is a app geared toward teens and cheaters. Just another Facebook wannabe.
So my snap is acting strange. I don’t know if it’s because of the bug fixes or the update, but it’s delaying as far as me clicking on someone’s name or even me trying to get into the app itself. On top of that, it keeps dismissing itself. For example I would be using the app and then it would just close itself out. Is there any kind of solution to this?
I onl use this app to say in touch with friends but I really think that Streaks is a wste of time.
Idk what that’s issue,  I’ve unloaded the app , re loaded   🗑🗑🗑🗑 
I deleted the app because I hate the new update so much I 100% do not recommend snapchat anymore. Too clustered
The new look Snapchat got on its recent update  is absolutely atrocious. It is near impossible to navigate effectively, its ugly, and it seems like the company got lazy and just crammed everything into two tabs. It's as if they are fitting 97 clowns into a Peel P50. (If you don't know what the is, please look it up, it's quite funny) this app gets 1 star until they make it better. Please fix this trash can of an app that you released in this past update. The old Snapchat was MUCH better. #BringTheOldSnapBack
i. hate. the. update.
#InWakanda M’baku’s children would eat you alive for this atrocity of an update. Roooofff Rooooooff rooooof!   CHANGE IT BACK! 
i think this new update has brought a lot of glitches. for example, every time i send a video now my phone freezes. another problem i keep having is with my streaks. i get the timers way before 24 hours and i keep losing streaks. some of my streaks are lost on my phone but the other person still has them. i have emailed support asking for the streak back but i was denied. please fix this
Deserves less than one star. Stories are not viewed as much. And it’s a clutter
Really messed up a great app!
I still use Snapchat due too having my family and it’s our way of sharing but the use of it is no longer the same. The concept is just not something that I’m getting used to. I know how to use the new update of it but I Hate it !!!!!!! Change it back!! Inbox on the left and stories on the right ! It’s the way to go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I use Snapchat multiple times a day and I use it as a means of communication between my friends and I. Unlike most people, I really didn’t mind the update too much. However, it aggravates me when Snapchat literally opens snaps for me and/or makes certain snaps expire. These snaps are different things I need to know and/or conversations. They don’t have a right to take those away. I literally went from 104 snaps to 49 snaps without opening a single one. This really makes me mad because it’s not their right to do this and I want to respond to a lot of these but I end up forgetting because they are at the bottom of the list saying they are opened. Other than that, I think Snapchat is a great app and should be widely used besides this one aggravating problem.
Whoever decided to update this app should be fired and whoever thought that the update was a good idea and actually went through with it should be ashamed of themselves. it's so confusing and not user friendly, the old snapchat was so easy to use but they decided to change it. why fix something that isn't broken? just because you CAN update the interface doesn't mean you should
the title pretty much explains the new update. wish i could give this app negative 5 stars.
I have been using the app less and less! I hate the new update, I don’t like seeing other people’s snaps I don’t know or care to follow. Also I hate that my friends snaps can’t be replayed! It’s horrible!!! Please change back!!
Snapchat is a fun app that I use everyday! I love this app because I can talk with friends through pictures, videos, and text. But this new update is awful! Get rid of it and you can have 5 stars
Used to love it but update made it terrible.
Snapchat was perfect till it updated. It’s complete trash now tbh
The ad stories are annoying and make the app less enjoyable. Might be time to say goodbye to Snapchat.
BUN THE MANDEM
You guys changed the layout slightly where stories would be separate, but that clearly isn't the problem. Everything is clustered together and does not look appealing. Change it back to the old layout. Clearly you don't care about your users if you're gonna keep this update, how embarrassing for one of the biggest social media apps or even apps in general I'm never gonna get used to this update I cringe the moment I open it I really hate that I can't just not use it because it's one of my main places for messaging. PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK 
It's on a black screen
I love snap but ever since the new update I’ve hated it
I don’t want to see other famous peoples stories..
Where is big smoke and the other memes tell me plz
App is ok.  The new update is the worst!
The app is great but I have some feature requests  1. Let us save filters Filters are great but some filters come and go, I think we should be able to save filters we love 2. Privacy This is a privacy problem a lot of people are experiencing. I wish it didn’t say when you ‘screenshot’ or ‘screen record’. I think it should not say when we do those things.  Other than that the app is great and thank you!!!! 
I’ll get a notification that somebody snap chatted me but then go to the app and it’s not there. Few days later it shows up? Fix this!!!!
Next update please revert back to the original layout. I’ve stopped using Snapchat as much because the disorganization causes me stress. Please change it back
This new update has to be the worst they’ve come out with. I’m not big on social media, and don’t have an IG or FB, but Snapchat was the one personal app I liked to have cause of how quick you can share with people. Disappointed how messy this update has made the app, wish I could roll it back but instead I’m just getting off Snapchat for good. Was the last social media I was hanging on to
Please bring back the old snapchat!!!!!!
i hope y’all are embarrassed  how many times do i have to leave u guys on read before u stop snapping me? i don’t love u take a hint 
Y’all are UGLY for doing this. First off the update is fugly asf and stories and regular snaps SHOULD BE ON SEPARATE PAGES y’all are seriously Ugly my god
Can you all please switch it back please? I promise you you’ll get so much positive feedback if you go back .
NEW LAYOUT IS TRASH.  TRASH TRASH TRASH.
update blows...
I don’t even use this app no more since the update is bad
the new update is absolutely terrible and snap needs to swallow their pride and get rid of it!
0/10
Ever since the new update, mixing exploring with your Snapchat stories from friends, Snapchat has became absolute trash. They need to separate stories from your friends an exploring ASAP! App will be deleted if something doesn’t change.
The new update is trash. I don’t want the Celebs I actually follow in a list with your bs ads and people I don’t follow. I don’t view their stories at all anymore and I barley even open the app. I hope you lose billions of dollars. I only use this app to take selfies and then I go elsewhere. Can’t wait for insta to get better filters because then I’ll be gone for good ☺️🖕🏼 screw you snapchat
Snapchat, I would first like to say, the new update is horrible. I used to be on Snapchat every single day because I enjoyed it. Now, I hate the update and since then my streaks are continuously showing hourglasses when I know for sure that my streakers and I are sending snaps in 24 hours. What is going on? Fix this!
The new update is the worst. I hate it with my whole heart. I, and everyone I know, would like something similar to the older versions. They were simple to use and had a greater aesthetic appeal.
This update is terrible. I've had snapchat for 5 years and this is the worst thing they have  ever done. Please change this back now please.
The new update almost forces you to watch the featured snapchat pages. Literally no one likes the update.
The new interface doesn’t make any sense
Hate it so much. Sorry snapchat.
C’mon
Worst update ever it keeps closing out and it wont let me in needs some serious bug fixes !😡🤮
For the group chat, I really want the group chat to video chat each other just like one can when it’s only two people. Please make this happen🙏🏽
dear snap,  this is unacceptable. when will you learn, when will you learn your actions have consequencesssss. no one likes this update, duck your update beach. i hope that you are losing money and that your bitcoin is snatched sis. a wise sister once said “hey sisters” -James Charles. i think you can learn a lot from this because you just can. i like the bitmoji stuff but DO NOT put the stories and snaps together on one page bc they need to divorce. like, you can’t put things like are not meant to be, together sis. instagram is literally on a stretcher, like insta sis is quaking. so in conclusion step ya game up sister sister and you’re welcome for this. -jake paul (the uglier brother) 
I Can barley find my friends stories on here after the update. Seems like almost no one is posting snaps anymore too.  Don’t download it, it’s a waste now after the latest update. Most unfriendly user interface I’ve seen on an app. I’m deleting right after this review.
Hi my name is Louis,   I totally disagree with this update because the stories are not convenient, I rather it automatically go through all stories instead of clicking the different names. I haven’t even got the different text update in the app even though the App Store says the App is updated! This is totally ridiculous, I hate Snapchat now. 
went to insta since this. clearly the majority does not like the update. hate the new confusing layout.
Quite sad to see a platform that had so much potential.
This new update was such a mistake I could go on and on. This was my main place to communicate . I haven’t posted a story since the update. I barely talk to my friends now. Why does it look so messy? Why can’t I find an article explaining the benefits of this update? Why did the CEO sell his stock if y’all “believe” in the update?  FIX IT. Long term the new generation of snappers won’t exist because they will see the overall rating and pick instagram. What are y’all doing?
I loved Snapchat. It was so fun and user friendly. The updates and filters were a lot of fun but recently their updates have been overkill. Changing things that didn’t need to be changed and ultimately making the app harder to use and not as fun.  I’ll keep my eye out for a reversal of their recently released update. 
Amazing update with extra captions, but recent update, with a whole new change, isn’t really impressive for your work. I feel like many people are uncomfortable on the way the stories are now placed.
This update is not only annoying but very irrelevant. In fact If it wasn’t for streaks and a group chat I’m in, I probably wouldn’t use it at all. Nobody watches your story anymore. Everything is all clustered together on one side when before everything from pictures, snaps , and stories were all evened out perfectly on three sides like it should be. I’m okay with change when it’s necessary but I’m just not okay with this one because ‘necessary’ happens to be the last thing you could use to define this update. I just hope the snap gods answers my prayers and bring the old snap back.
I have NEVER ever once left a review before (on here, Amazon, anywhere) but this update is review worthy. They should remove this update from our phones and let snap be as it was. Fix the bugs (oh, the bugs), but let us have our stories and snaps be separate again.
Horrible new update moving to instagrams snapchat. Not using snap anymore.
Everyone hates he newest update
You will lose your rank with this update keep on
I wish Snapchat would just change it back. The update was terrible and made the app way harder to use. It also makes it harder to get views on your story
Seriously. This new update is as confusing and misplaced as it could possibly be. I can't find my stories, or peoples stories that I follow, random stories or "popular" ones show up that I don't care about. If I did, I'd be following those people. Fix this update or I'm seriously deleting it for space on my phone. It's junk now.
Honestly everyone hates this update I suggest you change it back we can’t see people’s stories now because it’s just all over that place & I hate seeing my messages from months ago
Okay so when I first got snapchat, I loved it. But now that we are getting older, snapchat is just a life ruiner. Friendships are being ended, people are killing themselves because of what people say to them over this, and snapchat is what everyone is obsessed with it. Little kids, who should be playing outside and having no care in the world, are now crying over relationship breakups and are worrying if they lost their streaks. I understand our world revolves around snapchat, but it would be a better place if it wasn’t in it. Please take this into consideration, for everyone’s sake.
Just change snapchat back. I have no idea how to use it anymore, and Instagram stories have become much better than Instagram now. Change it back!!!
Are you guys bored? Let me understand what’s going on, what was running threw your mind’s when this update was created. I honestly never seen so many bad reviews on a app that people love using before. Wow keep up the great work guys you clearly know what your users want! ✌🏾
Bring back te old version.
With the new update a timer appears on multiple streaks even when snaps have been sent back and forth within 24 hours. The streak will then disappear, and the only way to get it back is to snap the person 3 times in a row and it will reappear. It’s very annoying and should be fixed!!!
hate the new update really disappointing
I loved the old Snapchat but now they completely messed it up with this new update. I can’t tell which one is a story and which ones a message. PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK
The new layout is not good. Stories are now merged with individual snaps? Separate them again, it’s hard to tell who has a story and what is just listed from a previous snap. Also the ads are just obnoxious
I had my automatic updates off and still somehow my Snapchat updated to the newest version. I am not pleased. Change it back or fix it so that it is not as confusing to use. Thanks.
It’s ok 😐
Don’t download
I use to love this app but now it looks cluttered and yall do too much with the updates. This is very disappointing and making me think about deleting my favorite app. Even after all the bad reviews and ratings NOTHING HAS CHANGED. Please do better because this is just depressing.
Snapchat used to be fun, but with the new update its actually harder to navigate my friends and other peoples stories.  Also as far as how stories are posted it’d be better if i could see recent stories that people just posted instead of a select few and they’re old stories never anything new. Ads are already taking over other apps but on Snapchat the subscription to other “news” or whatever you wanna call it might as well be an ad. They take up more space than actual stories.
it feels so cluttered and unorganized now. i miss the old snapchat where stories and snaps were separated. PLEASE , snapchat , let the next update be to fix this mess and let the most recent stories show up first. thank you for considering this. please change it to the old snapchat. if you want ur ratings to go back up i suggest you do so goodbye :) 
It still feels cluttered. Just too much subscription feeds, it gets annoying. And about that location thing where people see where you are, it’s a bit creepy. I don’t know, for the sake of the naive kids out there. Thanks
Can you guys just please go back to the old Snapchat or organize this one a little better? Maybe by chronological or alphabetical order? That would be nice, I just feel lost even after having the update for weeks.
I hate this updateee !!!!!!!!!!!!! Change it back n if y’all gone copy Instagram add the “poll”.
Snapchat is one of my only forms of social media and I absolutely loved the app - until the most recent update. As most users, I find the update to be distracting and it makes it very hard to find the content I’m looking for and interact with my snap friends. I hope that Snapchat takes into account their users opinions and will revert back to some of the old ways, including a page dedicated to stories.
They were the #1 photo app for the longest time; new update they fall to 3. There aren’t many competitors that you’re facing and you’re 3 when you used to be 1. Change it back
Like I don’t understand the point of the update. Good app before now it’s trash.
I really dislike the fact that I’m seeing stories of people that I don’t even know and that I don’t add myself. For example I have Selena Gomez on Snapchat I like her snaps. But I don’t have blac chyna on snap because I don’t know anything about her but her story pops up ? For what?  I didn’t add her so why am I seeing her stories and I pressed don’t see stuff like this but she keeps popping up.
Snapchat’s dropped nearly three quarters of my streaks (when I did recently did them) and refused to change the app back. I am fed up with snap and am getting so close to deleting this app. Snapchat had a great run, but now will be kept in the past with “MySpace”. Ever since the update the app has been going incredibly slow and makes me hate even trying to be on snap. We need another app that is very similar to snap, but ACTUALLY LISTENS TO THE REVIEWS. SMH!!!
I love Snapchat, it’s my number one app that I use to talk to people. But this update is trash. I don’t want to see everyone’s stories where my chats are. If I wanted to see that I’d go to the other page, ya know, where the stories used to be
i’ve has this app as long as i can remember. it used to be amazing, simple, easy to use, - this new update which updates itself despite having auto updates off makes the app very hard to use and time consuming... i don’t even watch story’s now bc it is so hard... it takes me twice as long to open and reply to snaps, i’m constantly opening the wrong snaps because of the new the snaps move when you send one... none of the snaps are in order, the people you talk to over snap and messages are mixed in with people posting to their story’s, and good lucking finding that story again.... bring back the separate story page, bring back a separate friends page, and bring back chronological order for the sending as receiving of snaps!  GRRR! this new update is so bad.. very upsetting to see snapchat take a turn for the worst! make sure to sign the petition online! Nobody likes this update, listen to what the user want — change the update back to the way it was originally 
REMOVE THE UPDATE PLEASE☺️
The app is borderline unusable after the update.
The new update is horrible. Finding private stories is impossible, it opens up snaps I haven’t looked at yet, and it makes me lose track of all the list of my friends that I want to snap. CHANGE IT BACK!!
The only thing I want back is the story page on the right and for you guys to make it where whenever has an active story, don’t put it over a person’s bitmoji on the left side. Other than that, I love this update.
Giving me more reasons to delate Snapchat.... it was way better before
Y’all know this update is whack. How many weeks has it been? Please hurry up and undo it. Finding friends isn’t terrible. But you can’t rewatch their stories which like ??? okay ?? On top of that celebrities and youtubers I follow (but haven’t added back) are incredibly difficult to find because snapchat does not put all of them at the top like they should. This new layout is frustrating. It’s stupid. Instagram has you BEAT. Just change it back already my god
After years of using this app. I am officially deleting it as you have made it the most annoying update in the history of the internet. Would ratchet get back on MySpace
!!!!!! Bring back the old snap
SnapChat was a pretty cool, organized app but now it's just a hectic mess. I'll snap someone and not even five minutes later they're gone because everyone else updated their story.  If snap was reserved for a few friends and a low number of contacts I could *maybe* understand this layout. But it's not; it's a huge social media platform and therefore is not equipped to be organized in such a sloppy manner.  My conversations should be separate from my friends' stories. My conversations should be in the order of most recent to least (as is every other sort of messaging app). This update is a step backwards and is just simply an unorganized mess.   Listen to your users please; we are the ones who keep you relevant. 💰💰💰 
العن الله ابوه من تحديث
I love snapchat but I would really enjoy if it stopped crashing every single time I opened a snap
I hope you know that I’ve learned to TOLERATE this update but I certainly do not like it still. Instagram is now the main thing that I use since yanno you guys went and messed up everything. You guys were at the top, now you basically voted yourself off the island, eliminated yourself. Too bad because you guys had a great thing going. This update is not like the other interface updated you guys had, this one is the most dramatic change and most confusing, so congratulations YOU PLAYED YOUR SELF !!!!
I love Snapchat I use it everyday it’s great I just really don’t like the new update it makes it hard to keep streaks and sometimes you will I accidentally text the wrong person because there story would make them pop up to the top of the screen and it gets really annoying and the new update make it feel crowded like you didn’t open all your snaps when you really did I just wish we could go back to the old snap chat .
Deserves 0 stars after new update. Cluttered hot mess. Not sure why you want us to have things out of order now🤔are you the new instagram? Might as well use that from now on
even though i know how to use the update its still confusing, an eye sore, and doesn’t make sense. snapchat isn’t even fun to use anymore because of all the steps you have to go through to do what you want to do.
This new update is terrible! I really enjoy using Snapchat but with this new update it is really turning me against it. So please please give us the old format again!
👎👎👎
If you have an iPad (or at least an iPad mini) it has the old Snapchat layout with the new Snapchat capabilities. Now if only it was the same for all versions.
First off, not a fan of this new update at all. However, if you are going to stick with it, here are some suggestions:   Instead of having All, Stories, and Groups tabs, have individual tabs for Snaps, Stories, and Groups.  It’s also a little tough trying to get into the text portion of a conversation. Occasionally I replay a snap by accident or open a snap by accident. If that could be smoother, that would be much appreciated. 
Yeah your extra developments with the “all, stories, group chats” didn’t help anything. It’s just more small words some people are going to have a hard time reading.  •Plus you can’t slide to enter chats anymore  •Stories still aren’t in order  •Group stories are barely discoverable  •You can’t add anybody via group story unless you screenshot their user name.   Honestly if you’re going to leave the update in the format it’s in (even though it’s complete crap), here’s a few suggestions:  add like 3 more options with the “all, stories, group chats” stuff. Have a page where it’s JUST chats. Have a page where it shows the snaps you’ve opened and received in ORDER like the LAST update. Have a group story page so you can actually see the group story instead of what you’ve added on it.   So like: Group chats, Group stories, stories, snaps, all.   And actually put your stories in order. Either in time order, or alphabetical order. Or both, like you used to.   Oh and don’t force updates. I had my phone (iPhone 8) where updates were optional, & it still forced updated on me.   Either way something needs to be done. Even if the updates make money, you’re going to lose money SO fast if you haven’t already. Please consider at least having a mix of the 2 updates if you are so fixated on keeping Snapchat in the new format/style it’s in. 
Don’t know why Snapchat isn’t listening to its users! We sure know you are hearing our feedback and being that we are the consumers of the app it would be smart to give the people what they want instead of acting like you aren’t receiving this backlash. Not only has this done damage on our part but clearly your side is losing over a billion dollars now because of it. As of now the app has a rating of 1.8 and I hope it lowers more so this can be fixed. People’s jobs are on the line and action needs to be taken!
The new update just took something amazing and ruined it. The discover page is a mixture of advertising, personality snaps, and a few people from the friends list.
not happy with this update... i think it’s unfair Snapchat won’t listen to its users, when the vast majority is saying the same thing. please get rid of or fix this update
Ew
02/27 Update:  The madness continues. Now the stories I subscribe to are being pushed out by more and more crap that Snapchat is pushing. Stories are now useless. Seeing that Instagram now has Snapchat’s previous functionality. When are you going to listen to the users and back off this horrible version. Wish I could give this less than 1 star.  Original:  Snapchat was a great app. Now I wish I could give it 0 stars. Stories are the absolute worst now. So much crap mixed in with the stuff I want to see. Tapping see less like this doesn’t mean a thing. The former best social media app is now dropping like a rock. 
How come my camera looks so much worse through Snapchat than it does through the regular camera app? Please fix this! The app could be 100x better with better quality Add the ability to edit captions of posted images, change their length or if they are infinite or not, turn off sound etc I don’t really mind the updates, but I don’t like how the stories of people I don’t follow are pushed onto me. Why can’t there be a separate discover page instead of pushing my friends into a metaphorical tiny closet while the people I don’t know can roam the house? People used Snapchat in order to follow their friends, or a celebrity they like, everyday lives WITHOUT the additions of traditional social media but you’ve crushed that and turned it into something else entirely. 
Your digging your own grave. I’m disappointed in you snapchat...
This new update is horrendous. It broke something that did not need to be fixed. The main interface is now too much overwhelming, mashing both personal messages and stories into a disastrous mess. The Discover page is just all for ad revenue and featured celebrities. I use Snapchat very regularly, but after this update I think I will use this app much less frequently.
The new update is terrible! I don’t want to see the people I don’t usually talk to in my list. I hate that the stories are now grouped in with your private conversations. If I want to watch stories, I used to be able to go to that tab, which was kept separate from my private messages! Grouping them together was a terrible idea. It’s incredibly messy. And to he honest, I’m less likely going to click through people’s stories.  Suggested improvements: -Separate stores & private chats.  -Make it easier to find your own story! 
I’ve waiting for it to go back to the other style. I love the Bitmoji update but snap is annoying. I hate that I have to go search up my friends name to view their story. Change the layout back please.
I loved Snapchat and used it almost every day. I don’t use Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram but I did use Snapchat; until the big update. It seems like the app is now only beneficial to big brands and influencers. The redesign is allegedly supposed to make interacting with friends easier and more intuitive but it doesn’t. Snapchat was perfect before the update. Now when I look at my stories it’s not chronological. I see people’s names who never post or use the app before someone who has a story posted. Why? That’s ridiculous. That’s just one of my many complaints and wish you would just listen to your user base and go back to the only Snapchat instead of only caring about promoting influencers.
Sorry Snapchat, I loved you for so long... but the update...
You have a 1 star over all rating. Why aren’t you learning from your mistakes and fixing what you’ve broken?
i hate this update and so does everyone else. why hasn’t it gone back to the old one? it’s been like 3 weeks
I barely even open this app anymore since the horrid update. It’s basically just taking up space on my phone now. Sad, this was one of my favorite social media apps and this update totally killed it.
I use Snapchat frequently. With the new update I feel this app becoming useless more and more every time I use it. I absolutely hate the discovery side on the right, I have stories I’ve blocked before and they now show up there. This is a mess, please PLEASE change it back.
I love Snapchat, but I’m not a fan of the new update and the way they made the story’s.
Remove update. Thanks sc team
Just open the app and try to navigate it. I don’t need to explain myself. It’s unorganized, confusing and focuses SO HEAVILY on people’s profiles that you don’t even follow and irrelevant articles that just clutter everything up. I still try to use it but it’s a major decrease. Updates like this are how you push people away from your app.
Deleted this garbage. No longer a user friendly platform. Tried working with the new interface but it’s trash. G’bye!
I’ve had this app since it first launched several years ago. It’s a fun way to stay in touch with friends. After this latest update I’ve stopped using the app. The new set up is hard to use and inconvenient. I wish the creators would listen to their customers and change it back.
If we were to look at Snapchat as the inventors of the wheel. It would be safe to say that we all would be driving cars and trucks with triangles for wheels.... Also with as much backlash from the universe. You would think they would just go back to the old thing that has been working the whole time. If you ever find poison around an app developer for Snapchat. I am sure they would say something like “I know it will kill us but I wonder how it tastes....
I used to love Snapchat. It was my daily activity. I’ve been using Snap less and less each day since the new update. I posted my first Instagram story the second day of the update. I am considering deleting the app and my account. I hate the new layout and I’ve heard same from my fellow users.   Why did you fix something that wasn’t broken? 
New update had me confused
um what did you guys do change it back
Nee update is trash
I love this app☺️I really love talking and communicating with my friends as well😋but as an improvement, can you please let us be able to change our username cause I made a mistake and put a letter in my accident and I’ve been trying to figure out how to change it but it turns it there’s no way of doing that🙁just a suggestion😊other than that the app is really great and I really love it🤩💛💞thanks💘
I have no idea why y’all changed the way snapchat looks. Like its still un organized and i don't see that y’all gonna bring the old version back. Instead of trying to make this version better y’all should bring the old version back
Please I need a username change. I made my Snapchat in sixth grade and don’t want to make a new one. I have streaks longer than a year and snapscore above half a mil I really need a username change I didn’t know what I was thinking in sixth grade. I’m in eleventh grade now 😬
سيئ
who thought this was a good idea? Y’all need to get a better design team because this update is literally a pile of hot garbage.
I don’t like the new update but I like the idea of snapchat! I still can’t get the new fonts to come on my phone and I have updated it and it says it has but it hasn’t
I loved Snapchat until the new recent update. It doesn’t make sense as to why they would add the stories to the conversations. I lose track of where my conversations go because someone will add to their story bumping my convo down.
Just bring the old snapchat back, ya doing the most. Make everybody happy and bring it back... we all loved snapchat because of the simplicity. The people are the ones ya should be making happy correct? Ya want to please us.... just bring it back.
Don’t know if you guys just hired a new intern to change the graph user interface but a toddler would have wrote something cleaner. Ridiculous how desperate you money hungry fools are to shove ads down our throats. Come up with something better before someone else does unless you want to be the next Vine.
I would give a 0 star if I could! This update is the worst thing Snapchat could have done! I deleted the app and now downloading it again all in hopes that I can record videos again!!! It’s so frustrating that I record videos and it doesn’t record but then when I let go of it, it’s recording and the whole video ends up being a picture of wherever the recording ends.
I just want the stories separate from the direct messages again!!
Deleting
Snapchat is the worst app ever after the last update 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
I was perfectly satisfied with how snap worked before, but the past two updates have just ruined the entire app for me. It’s a hassle to look at friends’ stories and to even access my own. Why fix what wasn’t broken?
Please
This update is trash, I rarely used Snapchat to begin with now you are giving me a reason to permanently stop. Thanks.
I don’t use this app at all anymore because the new update is awful. Bring back the old Snapchat.
It pauses your music every notification
Bad update.
Ok I’ll give one star up from my last rating. You tried to”fix” the update. But all that time you spent improving it, you should’ve used to listen to what people want and PUT IT BACK. The update is still absolute garbage. Sure you made a separate page for stories, but now I have no clue which story I watched and which one I didn’t. I do not want to rewatch a bunch of stories, I waste enough time on social media as is. Quite being prideful and listen to the people that still want to use this app. This has me seriously considering just moving to Instagram. It’s basically the same thing at this point, and honestly better now.
This latest update has made the app incredibly difficult to navigate and detracted from its quality to the point that I have almost completely lost interest in using it. I use it a about a fifth as much as I used to before the format change. It is glitchy, counterintuitive, and makes all of the things I like best about the app difficult to use while putting unwanted features front and center. The discover page force feeds me content completely irrelevant to me and unwanted while hiding the stories and content I'm actually interested in. I often find I'm out of the loop with my friends' snapchat stories because the layout is so confusing.
Why would you change something that was already great. The update is two hundred steps back. Random peoples stories show up. It's hard to see who posted what. The layout is confusing. The only good thing I like about it is the fact that you can change fonts now. That's it.
I used to love Snapchat. However, with their recent update it’s difficult to know when your friends have posted new stories. The way the new update is designed seems as if the app made it for the user to watch those cheesy and corny ads or articles at ease. Now when I want to watch a friends story I have to tap a tiny bubble on the side of their username which often leads me to the screen to make a chat with them rather than seeing their story. It’s frustrating and annoying.
The new update is horrible!!
Welcome to the club of Hi5, Myspace, MSN messenger, BBM. Horrible Update. Bye. Worst Social Media App due to the horrible update. Congratulations. 
Go back to the old snapchat this update is absolutely terrible
GARBAGE UPDATE. ALL THESE BAD RATINGS JUST HAPPENED AFTER THE UPDATE
It was better before the update but now i don’t really like it as much but it is still a great app
I don’t ever write reviews so I’m writing one now because this new update on Snapchat has got me annoyed! I hate it.  Change it back to the old version! 😐 
Son bring back the old one this one wack
This snap update is completely awful!!! So annoying to use. I’ve used snapchat for many many years and this is the first time I’ve considered deleting the app. It is completely annoying to have to search peoples names to watch their stories and have the most irrelevant people at the top when I don’t even talk to them. It is cluster phobic having Snapchats, stories, texts, and everything on the same screen. It is unnecessary to have cosmo and all the adds on the right side, I believe everyone would rather watch stories than read the daily mail. Overall very annoying and would love to see it changed back. ALSO, in a future update i think it would be smart to have all of your streaks in one place when having to send a snapchat out to multiple people
Please return to the old format this new update is terrible
What do even do with this app?
Everyone hates the new snap. Mixing messages and stories is the most annoying thing ever. I can’t even find my messages. Change it back!!!
the update makes me want to kill myself
I hate the new update. How do I go back to the old version.
Snapchat CEO allegedly said "app is only for rich people".  Because of updates for company interest 💰 that increase adds and revenue Snapchat has lost focus on what made it popular: easy communication using pictures and messages with friends.
It’s simple no one likes it so please change it back!
If the old Snapchat would come back with the new fonts and gif features it would definitely be a 5 star rating, but the new update is completely awful.
the new update is trash. if you’re going to make it possible to delete captions with the trash can move it somewhere i won’t accidentally throw out my caption after writing it. i can’t open my chats because when i swipe to the right it goes to stories and ive lost several videos i wanted to replay because of this. I don’t want to see official stories of people i don’t follow. if i wanted to see them i would have followed them. I have hit “show me less of this” for all stories i don’t subscribe to and they keep popping up regardless.
I’m super sad about the latest update. I’m just going to delete. I’m going to miss it :(
Hate the new update
Your app went from a high 4 rating, you make an update and it drops to one star you might want to reverse it
Baddddd
This update was not in the best interest of snapchat's users. It's messy, feels bizarre to use and I have a hard time using the regular functions I've grown so accustomed to. I hate being bombarded by things I don't care about, news propaganda, whoever the hell this Demi chick is that Daily Mail will not stop slobbering over, and every other celebrity Snapchat story. I didn't follow them for a reason, I don't want to see it. I loved that Snapchat used to be for me to connect with my friends but now it's turned into a popularity contest just like every other form of social media. Such a disappointment.
This update is horrible everyone thought that the old version would be back by now. I rarely go on Snapchat anymore, I always snap the wrong people, I never watch anyone’s story, and my views have dropped by over 200. This update needs to go.
Snapchat used to be so organized, but now it’s awful. I’ve had the update for weeks and I still haven’t gotten used to it. I don’t understand why the company won’t listen to their users and revert back to the old format.
Change it back.
Snap chat is trash
I figured I would give myself an adjustment period but this update is ATROCIOUS. It’s messy, confusing, and not user friendly at all. I use the app so much less frequently now.
It was just fine new update is no good
Snapchat’s a really good and fun way to stay connected with your friends I’m not really sure about Snapchat maps but it’s fine just set yourself to ghost mode I love the funny updates on the filters I’ve been using Snapchat for about 2 years and do streaks with my friends I don’t recommend this app if you don’t like taking pictures of your self or something if your 1 of those people you can still message and call your friends I think it’s great
I don't even go on Snapchat anymore. Unless I receive snaps from my very close friends, but other than that I don't go on it at all anymore since the new update. Doesn't interest me as much anymore..
I gave two stars for the filters and uniqueness of it!!  I would give them 5 for the older version of SC. Please swallow your pride and undo the update. 
Why snapchat. Why can we not just have a simple app. With story’s and a way to talk to friends. Stop making everything so complicated. There is a reason you don’t even have a 3 star rating. I mean 1.8 is the rating and nothing is changing?
If I were to give this app zero stars I would. Snapchat you really have done it bad decision. Welp guess that’s what happens when you get money hungry ya are so dumb! You will fail so hard trust and believe me! You will be another MySpace.
So I used to love Snapchat, then it was updated and it’s terrible now. I also read something from Snapchat that the old update was supposed to come back a week ago. Snapchat for sure went down hill.
Needs to go back to the old snap. Literally so close to deleting the app
I can't navigate anything. Just to send a message to a friend has become so overly complicated. The app is no longer streamlined and easy to use. If it's not fixed, I will uninstall the app permanently. Way to ruin a great thing, you f*cking idiots. 
I don’t get your need for you news section you post something about guns and gun violence almost everyday it’s very one sided you post nothing about the moments that guns have helped saved lives or protect someone’s from illegal events happening. Mind replying me and enlighting me why this is?
I can't find anything, and I don't want to see celebrities that I don't follow pop up in the same place as BuzzFeed, Vice, and Cosmo. It's frustrating and stupid. The navigating my friends story feed is a nightmare, and I don't like that I can't watch it multiple times. This went from being my favorite app, to my least.
Snapchat took a good thing and destroyed it with the last update. What was once a fun and easy to use app has become cumbersome and horrible. It would be great to get the old Snapchat back and get away from this horrible update.
Could u guys just make snapchat great again ?!
This new update is literally the definition of messing up a good thing. you remember that one person that was super nice and chill in high school and once you graduated all they did was post annoying bulls*** on there FB page and try to get you to join there Vemma or Financial pyramid scheme? The new update is the equivalent. super nice and functional before.   money crazed and annoying now. 
I'm with everyone else on this.
The current version of Snapchat is the result of the app selling itself out for cheap ad revenue. The UI design is atrocious and unintuitive, which is absurd because they actually had above-average usability before.   I’m very disappointed in this decision, and it very well might make me uninstall the app. I’m certainly not watching any ads to support it. 
New update is like that one notebook you used for all of your classes
I just spent a good five minutes choosing “See less like this” on at least 30 of those irrelevant stories of people I don’t care about or have never heard of, only to restart the app, and still see those same stories. Do y’all not care about user input? Are these people paying for this content to be forced upon everyone?
GO BACK TO THE OLD AND LET GO OF THE NEW . DELETING MY SNAP UNTIL THEY FIX THIS BS . HATE HATE HATE THE UPDATE
just give us the old snapchat back, we miss it! the new update has been clogged and cluttered making it impossible to enjoy the app for what it is. the app is meant to keep us connect yet the discover page was made more important than our stories. absolutely outraged.
Want to know something? It wasn't Kylie Jenner's tweet that has been making you all at Snapchat take a hit. The update and new format is what has you being criticized to this extent. I think bringing back something similar to the original style would help with damage control. Otherwise, it's not looking too good.
Revert to old format!!
The new update is extremely ugly and confusing. All my views went down and it’s hard to navigate the app. I liked the way Snapchat was before y’all messed it up. People are leaving Snapchat because of the update now. Nice going! N O T update: ever since the new update when I try to watch my own story (I know conceited) it’ll glitch and freeze, go black when there was actually a video, and sometimes it freezes on other peoples stories too. When I go to send a video it’ll say it’s a picture and when I try and watch the video I’m trying to send it’ll freeze up a lot. Please fix this. 
SC was my fave!!! I'm not sure what prompted such a drastic change in the viewing panes for SC, but I think it should be reversed. Idk who the people are in Discover. Idk how to find my actual friend's stories. And I don't like that messaging is no longer in a separate place. Oh! And PLEASE ALLOW ME TO USE MY OWN EFFING PHOTO AS MY PROFILE. I like my bitmoji, but dang! Lastly, I had to start using other social network apps, becasue SC is extra wack now. 
I like the app and don’t mind the update unlike many others, although the one thing I would suggest is putting all messages in order. It gets really confusing going back to the app to find someone specific but can’t, even though I was just talking to them a minute ago. Also, when checking my new notifications on it (since it’s not in order) I can’t respond to all the people that text me because I don’t see their messages.
The new format really bugs me, it’s super jumbled and half the time I miss all my friends stories.
Horribly confusing to navigate. Design is far from intuitive. Very difficult to get the hang of. Cluttered with unnecessary details. An utter mess of an app. It's terrible.
Snapchat has been my all time fav social app! This new update I don’t enjoy it but I don’t hate it either I can deal with it. But how the heck is it going to update and not update the fonts 🤦🏻‍♀️ it updated everything but that and it’s so annoying seeing everyone change the font and I can’t 🤬
The update makes me want to kill myself especially since I can’t even have the new fonts despite updating both my phone and the app. Deleting the app soon if it doesn’t change.
I used to use Snapchat every day and now I barely even open it anymore.  The update is terrible and they need to change it back.  So confusing and just ugly.
Really like it is one of the worst things the development team has done. Even when a million people sign for snapchat to go back to normal they still don’t. It’s disappointing for an otherwise great app.
If you really think this update is for the best that’s all wrong !!! I can’t deal with the set up. I can’t see people stories or even famous peoples stories. I love snapchat and all but this update is just not cutting it for me. It won’t take me not even a year , two/ three and so on to get used to this new update 😡
New Update is Trash, if it’s not broke then don’t fix it!
👎👎
Your update is complete ass😑🖕🏼
save your storage dont do it
Went from good Social media app to complete garbage
This update is complete trash.
Instead of news, the discovery page is filled with Snapchat stories of random people who pay to get on the discovery page. Doesn’t matter how much you press “ see less of this” cause they will still try to shove it down your throat. I don’t care to see these people’s story on my news page. Disgusting & Disappointed. Get rid of it.
Snapchat is my go to app whenever I open my phone but this time Snapchat has made my hopes go down it has the worst update of its whole time and whenever I click in my friend Bitmoji or even open the snapmap it crashes pls fix these problems.  Else you can see you reviews go down. 
I honestly feel like the update is horrible and it needs to go back to the old way . And for a new feature Snapchat should be able to let us snap chatters go live, trust me everyone will like it
Can’t view the list of friends, if you aren’t talking to someone you follow their snaps are just gone after you watch them once. I’m not interested in these “popular” snaps, I want to see the people I follow!
The new update is horrible compared to the old version. I don’t understand why snapchat hasn’t changed it back yet. Not planning on using app until update is reversed as I lost all my streaks anyways.
Not too happy with the latest update. Used to be nice when the friends list was separate from their stories. My Bitmoji looks NOT like me anymore. Going to just use Instagram more frequently, unless things change with Snapchat. Was nice knowing you Snapchat, thanks for the memories ❤️
#WORTHLESS
You ruined snapchat!
I loved Snapchat but it’s new update is so much more difficult to navigate and it’s really not aesthetically pleasing. Don’t fix something that’s not broken! Bring back the old Snapchat. ALSO ANNOYED because I did NOT choose to update. My automatic updates are turned off yet SOMEHOW y’all updated my app 🤔 no bueno
The new update makes me frustrated, I keep messaging the wrong people. And the app crashes when I try to message people that I have my longest streaks with... maybe snap is just trying to get publicity but I don’t know. It’s frustrating.
The rating of Snapchat went down a whole lot because of this update they need to make the switch back to the old one.
Snapchat used to make it so you could see any of your friends story’s now you can barley tell when one of your closest friends posts a story because it shows it in the tiniest “circle” on the screen this is also annoying because it doesn’t post stories in order by time, Snapchat claims they have an algorithm but it’s more likely they just post all your friends stories and completely random order. Also when you text someone sometimes it covers where it says sent, so you can’t tell if you sent them something earlier in the day. SNAPCHAT MUST CHANGE IT BACK
I hate this update fix it
Snapchat is not worried about what it’s Users think. Yeah that’s you! The only thing on their minds is money. So if the new update is gonna make them money then there you go. The only way to prevent them from doing so is deleting the app and not downloading it again. In my opinion that’s what all users should do. Also consider giving them one star to lower their rating. Money comes from that as well.
I hate the new update because I can’t take a peak at my messages they just slide to stories. & on the message slide , I can’t what the person texted me if they send a snap or the snap stories reload !!!!!!!!!!! EVERYTHING WOULD BE BETTER IF YALL WOULD JUST ADD LIVES ON SNAP !!!
bad bad baddddddd i dont like it
I’m really hoping snap chat switches back to the old format before the update. It’s really annoying that stories are not in chronological order. That’s my biggest issue. Fix this please Snapchat!!! Other than that it’s ok
add more minutes to the memories
This new update is not user friendly and most of your users genuinely hate it.
The update that changed the whole look of Snapchat was truly the worst thing you could have done. I have gone days without even coming on the app where previously I used the app daily. I'm finding where most people are just moving on to no using Snapchat any longer they are just using Instagram story which what I've been doing. Most have stressed the reason for using IG & FB more is because of the new update. I can see that the ratings/reviews for this app have dropped immensely, and I'm understand why.
I use to love snapchat , now this update ruined it all, i hate snapchat now 👎😴, fix this please we all want the old snap back.
I used to absolutely love Snapchat and now I hate it. The new update is cluttered, confusing, and annoying. The most annoying part is that Snapchat doesn't even seem to care that everyone hates their new update. Most apps and companies fix what users don't like, so I don't understand why Snapchat won't. Who are you trying to impress Snapchat?? Just change it back like everyone's been asking you to!!!
Case lesson in how to take a fun app and “upgrade” it into total crap.
I’ve been using Snapchat for years to communicate with my friends in a fun way but this update ruined that experience... I’m using Instagram way more often now anyways so I’m just gonna stop using snapchat all together.
This app used to be REALLY good! No question 5 star worthy. I don’t usually write reviews unless an app is absolutely extraordinary or there’s major flaws. I loved the navigation to each menu even if it did take some playing around with it. Now everything is clustered together like a pile of mess. Navigating to your friend’s list is infuriating. Nobody cares about Discovery which, for some reason, got its own tab now. I get it’s to keep Snapchat free. The filters are pretty lack luster. Most are just animal heads with a massive “bloom” effect. They used to be pretty innovative and humorous. It’s definitely not 1 star worthy like most people who are rating it currently, but it’s a shadow of its former self. Right now it’s just...boring, unintuitive, and par for the course.
Feels so cluttered. I dislike it VERY MUCH. Have not gotten used to it. I’ve used it less since the update
Listen shorty I used to go crazy on this lil app but you goofy goobers messed it up. On foenem grace y’all gotta fix it or I need the ones on da guys
We want change now!!!
Horrible
Since the update my app continuously shuts down. Screen acts weird anytime I want to post or look at my story. Please fix the app it’s awful
I’ve been with Snapchat since you had to pay for replaying a snap or buying more colors! But this new Snapchat update is so bad! I’m sorry Snapchat but..... I’m out! So long friend!
When you gonna f****** change it .. ?!
I didn’t think it was possible to downgrade an app but you did. Would rate half a star if i could.
Ever seen I updated my Snapchat it crashes to much. Fix the bugsss
I love the new changes, and I think everything is more comfortable and easy. I would like to have the option of saving or have favorite filters, so we can have an easy access to the filters we use and like the most.
Snapchat used to feel personal now me and my friends don’t like opening to app
Simply put... you guys ruined the one application I use. No more stories to watch, if I don't open a snap it'll go to the bottom of the log, the whole right side/discover page is useless since I never go there now, and lastly fix how I see "my story"
The update was pure crap n it was only for Snapchat to make more money n not care for its users
why i love snap chat i use it basically every da it's just with this new update it gardener to tell simple things and my story views have went down...
The new update is extremely messy. How many people have complained about this update? Haven’t really opened my app since...
I have been using Snapchat for over 3 years now, and honestly this was the worst update yet. I get the fact that they wanted to organize who you talk to but it’s complete bs. I don’t talk to half The people listed “In order”, every time I try to watch someone’s story I open the chat by accident now. I also hate how the condensed the chat in one section. It was better separate. It’s seriously the worst layout I’ve ever seen. It was much better before this update. I’m so close to deleting this app based on the new update alone. Thanks for nothing. 
It’s not working on my iphone.  I’m still getting messages and snaps from people I put on “do not disturb”
It’s very bad , try to bring the previous update ! This is very baaad !!!
Please reverse it back!
let me start saying I love the app but I’ve been trying to reach someone at support for days now and no one answers my email. I’ve been having trouble with the new update. The multiple captions and font styles font appear on my Snapchat and I’ve been doing a million thing to get them from deleting the app and installing it again to changing my password and nothing makes the font styles options appear. If someone could help me with this problem I would highly appreciate it.
Snapchat is the WORST! The new “update” is a total DOWNGRADE! It needs to go back to the way it was before the “update” made it into garage! It’s ugly, confusing, & stupid! ONE STAR!!!!!!!!
I love the app and the update, but Americans hate change, and you need to remember that. If it was like this from the beginning and swapped it to how the other update was they would hate it just as much.
The update is confusing and doesn’t allow me to see everyone’s stories.
Change it back
Snap out here telling on all that un faithful people that’s everyone hates cause it shows who you talk to in past after you clear the conversation and it show up agin once they post on there story
If I could give an app no stars I would  凸（￣▽￣）凸. The update is awful whoever thought of it should get fired. Please go back!!!! I miss the old snap chat just as much as i miss the old Kanye. Snap chat was a great app before this update. I even gave it 5 stars, but now........idk. It’s hard to see people’s stories and hard for me to keep streaks. All y’all needed to do was have a button where u can streaks out, so u don’t have to click through.SMH 
Snapchat used to be a very good fun and convenient app to use but since the update it’s not fun anymore and no one wants to use it
I’ve used this app for quite a few years now. The update itself isn’t even that bad, the interface is fresh and I think I actually prefer all of the new option. But... I think you guys missed the “walk, crawl, run” phase. Instead of maybe adding a few things here and there, you completely renovated the app and that’s cool. You guys are the ones receiving the paychecks, but you do get them based off of your users. Ever since the update my app has been so laggy, I will take a Snapchat and the whole app will freeze and eventually when my phone un-freezes, I’m back on my home screen and my Snapchat is gone ): I have an iPhone 8+ So I don’t know where he miscommunication is between software/firmware but I hope you guys can fix this, if it’s a problem for other people especially.
i used to use all the time until the app was trashed by the complicated and odd update
Crappy app, I don’t even use it anymore
Would not download. The app is so bad now
عيفه والله. رجعو زي ما كان قبل يا كلاب
There’s petitions people and complaining. I don’t enjoy this app anymore and am close to uninstalling. I feel like I’ve lost close to all my streaks since everything’s so small.
This used to be a great, easy, fun using app. Now with the newest update, it’s the definition of trash. It’s an embarrassment. The makers of this update should feel ashamed. It’s a disgrace they would do this! I’m gonna delete my app. It’s that bad.
AS SOON AS I OPEN A SNAP IT MOVES TO THE BOTTOM AAAAGHHHHHH. I understand you guys are trying to move people left on open to the bottom but dang give us time to snap back.
I hate the new update I can’t stand it!!!
I hate the pointless “snapchatters” on my feed that are in the way of the channels I liked/ subscribed to.. it used to be so simple to catch up on what I actually enjoyed and look at my friends feed. Why can’t you just make celebs/ shapchatters have there own section, news on another, and my friends on another??   Change it to what it used to be .. add a new section with all the celebs/popular stories, add news in another section , and then we can all move on because I hate this update and I hate I actually spent 2 mins typing this out😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 
This new update might be the worst yet. It’s absolutely so ugly and difficult to maneuver. The stories, snaps, and bitmojis all being together looks so unorganized and tacky.  Everything about this update is disgusting. I don’t like it. I’d gladly take the old layout back. Although Snapchat has been my most used app to communicate with friends, definitely moved it’s way down the line majority. Snapchat, Fix yourself. I don’t believe anyone’s happy with this update. As of today I’m surprised Snapchat creators haven’t listened to their audience and made a change. The rating of the app has plummeted off of this one update. 
Please make the distinction better between the stories we viewed and the ones we haven’t yet. Like a single line separating the two would be great.
I hate how everything is on one page it’s makes it look messy and unorganized. It’s hard to use. I’ve had for a while and I still can’t use it 😡🚫
New update 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
for starters, this update is so glitchy, laggy, unresponsive, etc. when i get a message, it goes all the way to the bottom and sometimes it doesn’t even show i got on but i did and so i have to close the app out a couple times just to get it. also, it crashes all the time and it’s sooooo annoying. when i send my streaks, they don’t send even though i have good connection and everything. when you update things, make the app responsive and working before you add other things.
I really hate that this app now forces the user to scroll by so many things I don’t intend to view. You’re an app, why jam random things down my throat. I also hate how I can’t see/locate my friends.  .  . THE REASON WHY I HAVE THE APP. You add FRIENDS. This update is a means to make us view what this company wants us to view. It’s like a form of sneaky advertising. Get it together or you’ll be the next MySpace.
The new update has made this app a cluttered mess. Stories used to be easily organized on the stories screen (which is now the advertiser friendly community screen) now, they’ve been jammed in with your usual sent and received snaps and text based messages. Not only has this limited the user to using one page for almost all their interactions, but it’s also separated your friends and “content creators” so now if you want to check the stories of celebs, Athletes etc you have to endure the horrors of the new ad plastered community screen. I get why this was done, to sell advertising and that’s fine, but it could have been done much much better.
Classic mode option would be great. Will uninstall if something isn’t changed. Update 2/27/18 Snapchat won’t fix the update because ad revenue is more important than user happiness. My account has been deleted and the app is being uninstalled.
They recently updated Snapchat and it is cancer I hate the app now
Snapchat used to be one of the top social media platforms (behind twitter and Instagram) but now it ranks below Facebook for me, which is saying something. The new update is absolutely terrible, a cluster, and there is no consistency with when the updates roll out to people. I know several friends have lost streaks, cannot form streaks, and have lost hundreds of views in their story due to the confusing nature of how they are presented now.  Basically this app killed itself and Kylie Jenner confirmed it. 
I used to love snap, I would use it every day but this new update is horrible!
Everything on the new update is so messy and cluttered. I hate the explore part because now I have to see other famous celebrities’ stories that I do not want to see. I usually would only add the celebrities I liked on Snapchat and now I’m forced to look at so many.
The discover page is absolute garbage. If I wanted to follow famous people or celebrities I would have done it already. Doesn’t help if I click ‘show less like this’ because it just pops more of their stories up. When finishing a news story it takes me right into a celebrity’s story. It’s like there’s no way to avoid it. Garbage
i used to love snapchat. it was my favorite app in my phone and definitely the most used one until this stupid update happened. i didn't ask for this. it's so disorganized and so hard to tell who your snapping or who's story your seeing. i was outraged when it updated automatically. this update is terrible i hate it so much. change it now. it doesn't even deserve one star. if i could i would give it -6 stars but i can't. so snapchat go back to the old version and apple, we should be able to give apps less than one star. i'm very disappointed.
Change back
Give us the old Snapchat back
I hate Snapchat’s new update it was fine before they just messed it up now!!! It’s harder to chat and see people’s story they made it so complicated and stupid.
This update ruined Snapchat
Honestly, I don’t really understand what Snapchat expected to improve with this update. Every single person I know has complained about it at least once, and this is probably the reason for the 1.8 star review. Please just take us back to the last version. There was absolutely nothing wrong with how it was. If it isn’t broken, don’t fix it.
Y’all just add me Doloflexin 😂
New update is horrible. I used to love Snapchat and now I don’t even want to look at it. I might as well delete it. I probably will if they don’t change this horrible confusing “update”
Snapchat will now be joining MySpace & Vine now
Snapchat please bring back the old one the update is very confusing and ugly I want to go back to watching stories in order
I loved Snapchat until this update about a month ago
It’s comical how the rating of Snapchat went down to a 1.8 because of the update... lol. No need to fix something that was perfectly fine
You made it so the snaps that we get aren’t even in order because of the stories. I have to go looking for snaps to open them. I didn’t think you could make it any worse, but I guess you just won’t learn
The new layout looks as if the creator just got out of design school. It is cluttered and leaves me discombobulated. I feel like I have ADHD when trying to go through the stories/articles. If the creators cared about its users then they would revert back to the old format. But it’s apparent they don’t.
Snapchat is a great app, it’s just that it hard to send ANYTHING To ANYONE!
What's with this update? The whole point of Snapchat is to be able to send things to your friends, who thought it was a good idea to clutter up the app with stories from "influencers" that I have literally never heard of and couldn't care less about. This update is clunky, it's messy, and it disrupts the flow of communication between people. I hope you guys see the consequences of your actions soon, and change it back to the way it was, before people start abandoning this app the way so many have given up on Facebook.
So bad
Snapchat !!! Your users are begging y’all to go back to the OLD UPDATE! So many people are letting go. Go back go back .
dawg. please. just change it back.
This new layout is terrible. It is akin to Facebook combining News Feed with private messaging. Makes no sense and is absolutely confusing! Bring back the old layout!
Malooooooooooooooo
Ok so I see the ambition of snap chat trying to create a more efficient app but it completely remodeled the whole story aspect of snapchat. This was a really dumb change cause the app already worked great is is with its own page for stories and the even newer update which puts the stories right next to your chats makes it even worse because now I can’t figure out how to open up the chat without opening someone’s snapchat because if I swipe like I used to it brings me to a list of stories. Which I don’t need considering y’all now have them on the same page as your chats which is also confusing as hell because as stories are added your whole chat history gets mixed up. I believe If there was just an option to revert back to the original snapchat for people who don’t like or don’t want to learn the new update the ratings of the app would shoot back up and your users would be 100x happier.
Snapchat was a fun, easy to use app that my friends and I loved, and even some of our parents were starting to use. However, this new update has completely flipped that around. I now go on Snapchat once a day to send a snap to continue "streaks" with my friends who value streaks. The home "friends" page is impossible to navigate. There is no order - they aren't alphabetical, they aren't sorted by who has posted most recently, they aren't posted in order of your best friends. It is an absolute nightmare trying to find my friends stories, or check to see if people have opened a snap that I sent them. I used to love Snapchat but it has become a challenging burden. If you don't have the app already, I don't recommend downloading it, it is certainly not worth the time and hassle to figure it out
I don’t like the new update it’s so confusing
This update is absolute trash
So I’ve been in love with Snapchat for my entire time using it. But this new update is really weird. I have stories of people I don’t know. And I want it to be back to the last update. This ones just too weird and it’s hard for me to find things. Thanks!!
Your latest update has made me not want to use your app. I like how you can use new fonts and stuff, but seriously! Did y’all really think this was a good update?!  You didn’t even write what the new update would do on your description!! Why did you move the stories over to where all of the other stuff is!!!!!! And I can’t even see the stories of celebrities that I follow because I don’t snap celebrities!! I would give this zero stars if I could😡There needs to be a petition somewhere to revert Snapchat back to how it was before.
Stop trying to be like every other social media. Stop doing so much. I have used Snapchat less and less now over the past couple month because of all the changes. No one cares about the discover "news" stuff. The app is just bad now.
Undo the update that changed the whole apps format. My views have gone down drastically.
The new update is bad but the app is still usable with some effort. The update makes the interface very cluttered but keeps the ad page very neat and organized which makes it seem as if Snapchat is attempting to profit more to advertisements. This is very disappointing!
can we please change the new update? it is now very confusing to see story's and view snaps. I also can’t see everyone’s stories it’s very annoying
Let people clear all conversations at once instead of clearing one at a time manually. Let people choose what kind of notification sound they want to hear from Snapchat, the way you can change your text tone for iMessage. Let people get a notification when you’re about to lose a streak. Bring back best friends. Let people change the font size for their Snapchat (the font is wayyyy too tiny now). FIX IT!!!! IM SO TIRED OF THIS!!!! I’m not saying get rid of the new update. I know that Snapchat can’t and won’t do that. Just improve it! Build off of what you have! This is a good app but it has the potential to be amazing.
New update is so bad. Now we need to scroll through an arbitrary order of friends’ snap stories in the same page as direct snaps? Why? They’re not sorted by “most recent” nor are they alphabetical. Why waste my time digging through them? IF IT AINT BROKEN DONT FIX IT!!!! Please change it back.
We want the old snap back!!!
I like Snapchat ok for swapping videos/pictures, but I hate that it doesn’t keep record of chats - each time I open a chat window with a friend or group it only shows me the new chats and not what people are replying to. My memory isn’t good enough to know what the previous snap or chat was, so I’m usually confused and it ends the conversation.   I get the origin story for SC is the self-deleting content. But just like how we can now screenshot or download the visuals, it’d be great to have an option to keep chat history too.  (I also don’t like that the public figures I follow now are found outside of my friend list - I specifically try to avoid all the junk that is promoted on the channel (I guess that’s what it’s called?) page, so now I just avoid the public figures I used to follow too. Stop trying to force me to care about the channels from other publications/sources, please! If I cared, I would follow them! You already put ads into my stories, I don’t know why you make it so hard to like you Snapchat!) 
What I don’t understand is if your ratings are way down and you don’t want this to happen why don’t you just make a new update like ASAP because of how many people including my self hate it
C’mon Snapchat this update is horrible. The previous version was so much better. Why not just revert it back?
Change it back. Not user friendly and very cluttered. Change it tf back
This update has changed the I look to Snapchat , I don’t use it anymore because it’s became annoying and weird peoples pops up into my face
the update says i can change the font yet it wont let me 🤨
please just reverse it back no on likes the update!!
Love the features of the new update but Now i don’t even know where to view other people’s story! I literally can’t find it. Everyone is talking how bad this Snapchat update has been! Please change it to where viewing other’s stories is accessible as it used to be.
Snapchat took a nose dive when it decided to create this weird format for viewing all your incoming snaps. It’s confusing and full of ads that I don’t care about. Also what is up with this map situation that shows where all your friends are at? Isn’t that a big dangerous if I lose my phone and someone finds it? I loved Snapchat in the old format now I’m considering deleting it.
I'm very disappointed with this new update... HATE UPDATE!!!! CHANGE IT BACK!!!!!😡😡😡😡😡
This latest update of the app is horrible. I never review anything, but was compelled to write this. Not only myself, but others I’ve talked to at social gatherings hate this update. It’s horrible to navigate, you don’t see all of your friends snaps. Please change it back to something similar to the old format.
the new update is so bad.... please go back
This app is trash
I don’t like this update its trash🚮
Still hate the new update. Hard to use.
Change Snapchat back I hate this update and it makes me want to delete it.
update is cluttered and messy and makes it difficult and less enjoyable to look at peoples stories, as well as being confusing when you receive messages. I keep accidentally opening up messages like I’m going to talk to someone when all I wanted to do was look at their story.
I will not support a company that has complete disregard for their consumers wishes. It is obvious this update is awful and complicated to use. But due to SnapChat’s pride they have decided to ignore their consumers. I would rate this zero stars and they have lost me as a supporter.
We should all be able to change our usernames due to us making Snapchat at a young age our scores being high then realizing when ur trynna get somebody’s Snapchat that ur name sounds like a 5 year old also————- bring back the old snap majority of people liked it more and a ton of people stop using ur app due to the update it was much easier to navigate stories were better now snapping someone is a glitch and looks so messy and stupid j take everyone’s advice especially this and make this app good again
Talk about an unintuitive app. I personally didn't think it was great before, but at least I could find things. I can't tell where my feed are and only see popular feeds and topics. Also it's now the slowest app on my phone and wants to freeze any time I do anything. Also the dark theme was amazing and it's completely stupid do go with a bright design. I'm actually looking at Instagram stories and thinking it's a a lot better experience.      Edit: yep I'm done. I finally deleted this horrible app after I read the developers response. I don't mind you guys adding a few ads to the people I follows posts, but mixing them together with popular topics just waisted to much time. 
Use to be my favorite app to use but ever since that update that I didn’t ask for, I can’t even figure out how to navigate the app now.
Will no longer use
The update was the worst thing Snapchat has done. Normally our updates come with cool new fathers like integrating Bitmoji or the selfie filters. However, this new update has made my Snapchat impossible to navigate. I like that I had one page of just people sending me snapchats. I hate that you now add in stories. If I want to watch stories, I go to the stories page.   Snapchat, please go back to a simpler design! Add cool features, don’t change the whole layout!!!! 
I love the update... JK haha Snapchat messed everything up with this new update, I used it everyday and now I just deleted my Snapchat.
Snapchat is great, I use it everyday to text my friends. The filters are great, and all the tiny details are awesome. But I don't like the new update. It doesn't bother me to much but when someone has put something in their story it makes no sense, I can't see it without scrolling all the way down. And also in all the "popular" stories, are cool up to a point. It always adds things or peoples stories that I don't want. The GIF's are awesome too, but I miss the old Snapchat where I didn't have to scroll down to find someone. Don't get me wrong, I like Snapchat, but I love the old Snapchat.
it S U C K S
I rarely use sc anymore since the new update. It’s confusing. I can’t even locate the settings. It’s harder than algebra now. Sc was once my most favorite app. Throw the whole app in the trash. Fix it!!!! 
Are y’all mentally retarded? Nobody on this planet likes this update and yet you still don’t listen to your users. This is probably the worse company that doesn’t care about their users at all.
The new update is horrible.
The order of who you snapchat is all mixed up now so I have to scroll and figure it out. The app was fine how it was. Idk what they sought to accomplish with this new update. It made it even worse. Why. Explain yourself people of snapchat that thought this was a good idea
We should have an option weather to keep this stupid update or change to the old one. Everyone hates this new update ! Deleting snap today
I used to love Snapchat. I would snap multiple times a day and I would really communicate with my friends in a fun way through the app. However, now with this new update that they refuse to change that has all stopped.
This is the most confusing, stupid, ugly, horribly designed update. There’s not one good thing about it. You’ve already lost $1.3 billion dollars from ONE Kylie Jenner tweet. Nobody f****** likes it. You’ve already lost more money than you received for this update. “Get use to it” well it’s been like a month and it still is confusing and aggravating to use. Go back to the last update and maybe fire your app developers and designers.
I love snap chat just wished it didn’t get a new look
The new update makes viewing peoples stories odd and out of order, and since now the list of friends is out of order (not in order by who you last talked to anymore, it is just random), it is aggravating. Make the list of friends back in the order by who you most recently snapped, and put the stories back on a seperate page by who most recently uploaded. Stop making useless, messy, more frustrating changes.
Getting ready to delete the app, since yall wanna play.
genuinely distracts from content. The ads used to be about movies and relevant stuff but now they’re about useless, cheap things. Ruined app
Hi. I used to love snapchat before the new update. The interface is unproductive, and it has become much more difficult to view the content that I am interested in- private stories, my friends stories, and their snaps. Please re organized the format so it is more accessible. Thank you
My Snapchat didn’t used to crash all the time, but with every new update and “bug fix” it gets worse and worse. All the filters are constantly popping up and slowing down my camera, almost to where it freezes up completely.
Nearly 1.2 million people have signed a flipping petition that says we should go back to the old update. I personally agree because it is so confusing and disorganized. Like people we just want an easier way to watch stories, not some bull crap “story page”. Snapchat stop trying to be like Instagram!! If you were to ask the average person what they would give Snapchat out of 5 stars. THEY WOULD GIVE IT A -5 STARS. THIS IS NOW OFFICIALLY ONE OF THE WORST APPS KNOWN TO MAN KIND.
Please get rid of the chat bar in pictures. I cannot screenshot good pictures anymore because of it. Other than that the app is okay
The update is trash
F THE NEW UPDATE!
Unfortunately bad update 😓
there’s no way that y'all don’t know that everyone hates the last two updates, first of all, that updates wasn’t optional, second of all this new one is even worst. honestly y’all just need to quit trying to make this update better and give us the old one, whoever thought that this update was a good idea should be fired.
Hate the update!
ever since the new update came out, i have been on snapchat wayy less. i think i may just delete the app. how is it supposed to be fun or fair when im paranoid of sending someone the wrong snapchat or sending something to my story that wasnt supposed to be? i dont get how or why people at snapchat thought this update would be good. they should just reverse it back to the old one. Oh, and bring best friends back too.
Why can’t you guys just take me back to the old snapchat🤭😭😡
Snapchat was good until the new update, I can't even use the app anymore. Before the update I gave five stars, wish I could give half a star. Absolutely terrible update.
Old stories was better nobody really wants to watch that “discover” trash
The update is so bad I deleted Snapchat from my phone since it just takes up space because I never use it. Change it back
If I have to delete and download Snapchat one more time bc if the glitches of me not being able to take pics then I’m deleting it all together 😑
Hate the new version, I barely watch people’s stories now 🙄😫
I liked it better when I could see the people I’ve previously messaged in message section and not everyone I have on snap. Also why do my messages delete even after I’ve clicked to save them?! Lastly, I much rather only view the stories of people I actually know or have added on snap and NOT EVERYONE with a Snapchat! Please reverse this update, it’s awful!
used to be good, now it’s trash
Update is trash! And now I can’t even open a chat without opening my snap first! CHANGE IT BACK! Nobody likes it! And my streaks keep disappearing and reappearing! I miss the old Snapchat #ripsnapchat Don’t you see these bad reviews?!?
This new layout isn’t working. To have snaps in the same area as your chats is crazy because it becomes confusing from where your chats end and new snaps begin. Plus in the “discover” section I don’t want/need to see snappers that I don’t even follow. The news articles of before were just fine, we didn’t need any of this Snapchat. Please go back to the prior layout.
Not sure why change the look and experience of this app I’ve heard some many ppl that feel just like me hardly ever enter the app now with this new look
I am very, very angry with the snapchat application !! Because I lost all my streaks and I lost many friends without any explanation😡🤬😡🤬🤬😡🤬🤬🤬🤬😡🤬😡😡😡🤬🤬😡🤬🤬😡😤😤😤🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽
bring back the old update the new one is so confusing and unorganized.
I used to love Snapchat but “forcing” me (or suggesting like you’d like to call) to watch snaps of celebrities I couldn’t care less is way too much.
Ive been using snapchat for YEARS & The new update is awful, I legit delete the app and then download it just to talk to friends. I rather stick to other social media platforms instead.
Please go back
Not many people that I ask like the new update they all like the old Snapchat better and so do I.
I liked Snapchat perfectly fine until the new update came out because it changed my views 😒 I don’t get as many anymore .
The new update is horrible and we want the old update back I stopped using ny snapchat application since I UPDATED IT  The new upate is absolutely not practical/handy  And please change that so everyone can be satisfied  Thank you 
Seriously, I can’t even find my friends list other than the people I’ve already snapped recently.
Newest update: The downward spiral
This update hasn’t really effected me .. I’m used to it but it’s costed me loosing views and having my favorite celebs or Instagram famous people to leave Snapchat
If I could rate this less than one I would. Like the update is so clumped together it gives me anxiety. I mess choosing whose story I wanted to watch and I miss having everything in chronological order. Now I’ll be snapping a friend and all of a sudden their name disappears because someone posted something on their story.
Now my chats won’t come through you need to fix’s this
the new update is so confusing!  almost everyone i talk to hates it and it would be a lot more beneficial to change it back the way it was please.  also i have the issue with this update where i will send streaks every 24 hours and so will the other person, and it will still say that we lost the streak.  then the streak never comes back or takes a few days to.  fix this please
This new update is garbage and so is the company. The CEO must be clearly out of touch when he says “people just need time to get used to it.” No. People don’t want it. The interface is horrendous and forces me to see people’s stories that I don’t care about and hides the stories I want to see most. If I was the UX manager the team who designed this would be fired. It’s horrible and the fact that it was a force update makes it even worse.
Absolutely terrible interface design. Uninstalled until it improves.
So for some reason every time I tried to send a snap or take a picture for my snap streak my Snapchat kept force closing! Then everytime It opened It kept saying please check your connection then froze and closed again now half of my streaks are gone
The New update is horrible and is going to be the cause for many to leave Snapchat
I used to be able to listen to music while I snap, or watch videos on YouTube and receive snaps but now whenever I get a notification from Snapchat it pauses my music or video.... really makes me want to break my phone when I’m in a group chat that goes off every two seconds while I’m trying to listen to music. Of if I’m watching an instructional video.. this is just the beginning. This update is terrible for Snapchat, really messed up this time.. I don’t need a discovery page to see worthless snaps of some Kardashian or another overpaid talentless person.. really I added people that I wanted now I’m forced to look at, if not watch, everyone’s stories and some of them are terrible just to glance at. Then we come to the messages... when I send a message it should stay at the top, and I shouldn’t have to worry about clicking their story, or for that matter someone else’s, when I’m trying to message them go back to chronological order of messages not stories if I wanted to see their stories I’d search them. I also really hate how I can’t check my own story just by tapping! Nope now I have to open up the menu and click me! Please go back to the previous version, I’m all about change and usually I get over it but I can’t wrap my head around this poorly thought out m, terrible executed, scatterbrained mess you call an update. Please revert to the previous version I miss my music, videos, and being able to snap people!
The only threads from this app that I am holding onto are the VHS and heart filters, other than that the update is only a delusional success amongst the dev team that is choosing nonexistent pride and dignity over acknowledging millions of displeased consumers. I do not care how much money CEO Evan has, never forget where you came from. Without consumers, the app would be irrelevant, literally collecting dust in the store. Absolutely no reason to merge the chat and stories together, pinning suggested friends that you barely speak to at the top alongside unopened chats, otherwise leaving you on a goose chase to find anyone that you want to message. “We wanted to make things simpler by releasing an update that is more complicated.” — Team Snapchat, congratulations. You played yourself.
Snapchat is a great app and I use it all the time. This new version seriously dropped to a new low of the snapchat versions.  The format is just lame....I hope they fix it soon! Once fixed I'll give it a 5/5.
Please Withdraw your Upgrade! Miss the Old Version! 
There was an “update” however it wasn’t anything related to the issue of the cluttered format. People are just not using Snapchat anymore because of it so unless Snapchat goes back on the update people are just gonna move to Instagram and that’s fine one less app using up space on my phone.
Love the new game Snapchat added. How many topics and people I don’t give two craps about that Snapchat feels I HAVE to see so it can automatically run ads to increase its value can I BLOCK game.  My score so far is in the hundreds. Can you beat it?  No longer about user experience, more about profit. Should be like for only 35$ you can be on our trending topic page for one hour. Buy it now. Welp it’s dropping in popularity quick. Instagrams got more cool stuff coming. And tbh it’s not great but at least when they run an ad they tell you, not disguise it as a trending topic or story . Edit. Heard that the new update was to 1 let us know we are not friends with celebrity’s. Really? Sounds like BS and 2 to prevent fake news or whatever. But it shows you topics and popular story’s, that are FULL of fake news. So it’s doing the exact opposite . More BS. Maybe the truth saying hey guys we want more money would be appropriate than lies. Eye rolls. Update again. Now adding tabs so you can easily find your friends, um so it’s kind of like, wasn’t broken. Broke it and is now trying to hurry up and fix it before mom comes home😂 yea, like that ever happens. An I think I’m just done with Snapchat. I can imagine the poor guys getting yelled at now to fix something that someone else broke. . Just put it back like it was , wasn’t broken worked great now the whole thing is getting to be a mess. Enter circus music here. Hope you saved up your money guys, looks like you’ll need it soon.😂 out of jobs. 
I deleted my snap because of this stupid update
This update is a no for me. 😒 All of my friends’ stories don’t even pop up anymore. Just change it back to the way it used to be 🙄
I hate the new sc update
bring the old interface back.
Snapchat is fun but this new update is a NO NO. Stop updating it. Bring back the old snapchat and that PURPLE filter 🙄🙄
I have not been able to get any texts ever time I log in snap chat it glitches and bring me back me to my home and logs out of everything it take to long to load and open and you really need to get the old snap chat back
nobody even asked for an update, the previous version was so much better
Ok so I love Snapchat and all but there seriously needs to be username changes. Like I created mine in like the 6th grade and it is super dumb so being able to change your username would be great.
Why does the app constantly force close and who decided this new condensed layout was good?
New version of this app that launched early 2018 is trash... main contacts aren’t prioritized, “home” screen is scattered with friends who haven't posted a story.. so why do I have to scroll through 100 people just to find the one person who’s story I do want to watch. My celebrity’s that I follow are in a completely different page, than the rest of my stories. Again, not categorized. I would prefer if news channels were grouped, event story’s grouped, and maybeeee personal celebrity accounts grouped..... but I also have no interest in seeing 15 other celebrities who I don’t want to follow flooded on my page. It’s freaking terrible. I don’t think I’ll use this app much longer or ever again. Back to Twitter it is
the new update is trash.....so guys stop wasting your time on this app. the older version was waaaaay bettah. the comp should totally reboot the whole sc system back to the original version. it’s jus a suggestion that basically everyone is thinking of sooooo. thanks snapchat 👏🏼😐
Horrible update. Go back to original before no one use Snapchat because that’s looks like it’s going to happen soon
This update is really irritating ! You can’t find anyone’s Snapchat !
I hate the new update I haven’t used this app in a month & when I came back I was extremely disappointed . This app use to deserve 5 stars , now it’s worth nothing I wanted to honestly give it no stars I’m truly upset
Bitmoji update cool but the story view update is horrendous. Even going to the direct chat page is confusing with the latest snap timeline of who posted. The page that we use to go to look at story is just clumped together and looks horrible. The old setup was way more organized. And it was alphabetical. Here’s an idea like the music streaming services ask “what genres do you like” you should too instead of just putting a bunch of random crap we gotta sorta thru. Get it organized and fast
I use Snapchat all throughout the day, everyday. I love it! But this new update is so bad! I understand they were making it easier to watch stories, but I’d rather see my list of who I have snapped and snapped me, not the order of the stories.
Update they’ve had. You thought the update in 2017 sucked, well guess what. This February 2018 is worse. I went from hourly use, to weekly use after 2017’s “update”. It will now be monthly if at all.
New update 2/25: I would give this less than 1 star if I could. What the heck. Why did you guys ruin everything??? Why is this newer version of SC even worse than the other one?? I don’t think I can do this anymore. Thousands of people complaining for MONTHS and y’all don’t care.  New update 2/16: Guys. The stories are ruined. I can’t even find any of my friends’ stories because y’all cluttered the screen with random famous people’s. Also, why is my story not grouped with the others?? I’m really sorry but this is why everyone’s switching to Instastories:( Yikes 
Once I open up the app it drains my battery instantly!!!! It's slow also and the new update is just too confusing !!!!!!
I have used Snapchat for years, but now I don’t even care to look at it or stay connected. Everything is a mess and hard to use.. it was perfect the way it was before. PLEASE change it back!
This update is trash! People are losing streaks! It takes dedication to keep a streak going! You’re rating has gone from a 5 to a 1.8! Don’t you think this a problem? Let’s get the old version back!!
I type in a word and sometimes it will load, other times it won’t at all and it’s frustrating.
My Snapchat is saying I texted everyone just now and I haven’t texted anyone since 5;00 pm get it together .
Snapchat use to be simple. Now it’s hard to see recent stories. Sometimes you can only see snaps from 5 people. It’s all out of order. The page where you use to see friends stories are now full of ads and celebrities you don’t follow.... Facebook and Instagram now have better stories than Snapchat. It’s really bad now. Deleting. Not worth the hassle. Don’t use snap. 1.8 out of 5 tells you something.
Can you add the old version of Snapchat back?
Please let us disable this without muting our entire phone! It’s so loud and obnoxious
Horrible updates
The new update for Snapchat is so cluttered and confusing. It’s really sad, because I loved Snapchat so much. I’m now using it less and less daily. I’m writing because I, along with many other people hope that you will change Snapchat back to the way it used to be!!!!
This update is so complicated and ugly.... I can’t even see my friends stories without looking at a random person I don’t even know.....
Disappointed... used to be my favorite app guess not anymore
I liked the latest update with the “groups” “stories” and “all”. But instead of “All” I think “recents” would be better! The recents snaps received (with no stories on the people’s faces).   Also, can the font be bigger? I can barely see my streaks days and if it’s running out or not. 
Whenever I add new friends on Snapchat I can’t ever find them because your recent snaps aren’t in chronological order anymore with the new trash update and I don’t really think it was a good one, I’m very disappointed in the new update and will no longer be considering buying the Snapchat spectacles. :\
This update is a mess and confusing. It drives me nuts looking at the cluttered mess of story’s and how absolutely nothing is chronological.
Snapchat's new format has made the app much more disorganized and much less user-friendly: with stories clumped in with conversations and friend emojis being difficult to spot, this poor excuse of an update was unnecessary and difficult to use. I genuinely tried to like the update, or at least not despise it, and so did many others, however, when it comes down to it, it's just plain bad. It's become nearly impossible to navigate, with stories hard to come across (some of which are mixed in with articles! Because obviously, everyone wants to see what their classmate is doing right alongside their buzzfeed article) and certain functions even more impossible to find (for example: has anyone figure out how to change the names of friends on the app? I used to be able to do this with ease and now there seems to be no option. And what about just finding friends at all, without having to take a picture first? It was nice to have a contact list easily accessible) and from this update it's plain to see that to Snapchat, the importance of organization has been completely thrown out the window (alphabetical order, anyone?). I hope that the masterminds behind Snapchat will soon see that "new" does not necessarily mean "improved," and rather, the old is what many of us want back--especially when seeing that an app once loved by many that has now sunk to an overall 2 star rating due to this update.
I don’t like it and a lot of people don’t 😂💀💀💀💀💀💀💀😭💀😭😭😭💀💀💀💀💀😂😂😂😂😂 so can y’all fix it because a lot of people are giving the app bad ratings
If I could give it 0 stars, I would. The new layout of the update is terrible. Please !! Go back the old layout because this one is confusing and it’s irritating. There is too much to do for an app that was all bout simplicity! Please, reverse this horrific layout. Also, Snapchat updated without my permission (I have it in my phone that way) and I don’t appreciate it at all. I hate this “new and improved” Snapchat layout/update with a passion !!!!
I like seeing all my friends snap in a row i hate the discover section it’s annoying .. i know instagram is thriving since the change it really was the worst update ever
This update is still awful. Please go back to ah omg stories on the right. I never watch anything on the discover so now the right side is just useless for me. Please go back to the previous way
Snapchat Is Good And All But With That New Update Just Made The Usage Of The App Horrible And They Need To Revert The Design
I swear since the new update it always crashes. It always takes 10 million years for something to load and most of the time it doesn’t because it crashes. I can’t even accept my own story or memories without it crashing and just the whole thing with this app is just terrible. Snapchat is really dying badly my god....
The new Snapchat update is awful and disorganized.  It meshes messages with stories which was a huge mistake.  I’m moving on to instagram stories from now on.  ✌🏼👋🏼
why am i the only person in snapchat world without the new fonts ?!? This update is nutso
I love snap I’m not going to delete it or something but come on....... can u guys fix the update i didn’t even get a choice or a warning that it was updating u just did it..... now I barely get any views on my story cause who wants to watch people story’s any more it’s to hard. Also why do u put the story’s that are easy to access on the side with random people that I don’t even have I liked it before... plz just fix the update or at least move the stories back or easier to access thats really the only problem to me
I love how this “new update” is so amazing...not ever since the drastically ugly and cluttered update, the app crashes all the time. I’ve had it stop working, specifically just snapchat won’t load the feed, won’t send any snaps or load them. Half the time I don’t get a notification I got a message or snap when I’m not even in the app and have notifications turned on like I always have. And now it lags when I take ANY videos and doesn’t play them back it just freezes, and then eventually blacks out, and I can swipe out of the app and use my phone but I go back to snapchat and it’s still a black screen until it force quits itself and then the video is also lost. Great job, the app doesn’t even work now, but let’s keep aesthetically changing it, that should be the main focus.
It was great before the update
The update is awful. If you don’t have snapchat at the moment don’t even bother. Even without the update it’s too consuming. I’m going to try better to not use Snapchat as much as I do, the update will help with this goal since I hate it so much.
This Snapchat update really messed everything up, Great Idea. bad execution.
Snapchat i love you and am glad you’re making an effort to fix the trashy new layout of the app with the tabs separating group, snaps, and stories but PLEASE stop pulling an instagram on us and PUT THE STORIES BACK IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER PLEASE AND THANK YOU
Hate the new update!!!
I loved Snapchat. The new update just completely ruined everything. I enjoyed having all the stories on a separate screen along with the news and sports.  There have been numerous complaints but It looks like you guys don’t care. 
Please snapchat all we want is a notification if we’re about to lose a streak, not an entirely different format🙄
Well al good things must come to an end... all I want it my story page back... this seriously stresses me out to have snaps move to the bottom of a cluttered list... to snap the wrong person because of it.... I just don’t get who had such a terrible idea to do this lol... I’m sorry this is just aweful.
Please fix this. It’s unbearable at this point it’s just a terrible update listen to your fan base please.
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO LOSE USERS
Used to love Snapchat but now I cannot with the new update . It feels cluttered and it is so unorganized now . I have major OCD and the update makes it worse.
I think all of the new updates are incredible and Snapchat has been addressing all of the issues everyone has been having very well. My only problem is the gif feature and all of the bitmoji stuff is pretty laggy now.
Fix update you greedy developers
I love the neat new stylized clutter that is Snapchat!! It's disorganization make my life feel more in order!! It's the best how I can't find most chats and it would open or operate properly!! I also love how impossible it is now to view and post story's!! It's just what I need a new crazy mess that makes my life harder!!! Thanks Snapchat update!! 😄😭😭
The new update blows
I feel like giving 1 star and writing a few words to express how upset I am at the new update is not enough!!!
ohmygod this new update is trash and everyone thinks so do why arent you doing anything about it 
Go back to old so annoying
Everything’s confusing and not in order anymore due to the update
Snapchat was great until it scarifies usability to cram in more room for articles. It went far away from its roots and I rarely use it anymore.
Snapchat ....y’all have to change back because no this isn’t cute and I’m bored now! Thank you.
dear snapchat,            so snap was where i used to spend most of my time on my phone being a teen that was normal. i sent my streak pics in the morning and watched my friends stories and famous peoples stories who i chose to add all in the same spot throughout the day. now after that horrific update i don’t even open the app. it’s too hard to use and the layout is stupid because it is not intuitive. i can’t even watch the stories of my friends because they get lost and my home screen is NOT in chronological order!!! there is no reason behind that change it is instas biggest mistake and i thought you would know better. after i open a snap and i would double tap to reply i can’t because it shoots down into a black hole to where i can’t find it any more. that’s rude. and the last major flaw(i’m still leaving out many from this bs update) is that i have random “famous people / influences” that just show up in my discover screen (which no one asked for) like i didn’t add then i don’t want to see them get OUT!! who gave you the right to be here like stop. @snapchat you really messed up with this one so you should just switch it back because no one is happy about this tragic change. sincerely, a former snap god 
imma still use it though 😑
This is trash
I posted a prior review that never showed up!  Is Snapchat somehow preventing my scathing review of them? And what’s up with the “Boo Studios” clearly fake review doing at the top all the time?  Did Snapchat pay off the App Store?   I deleted the app and I’m not going back. Snapchat leadership is condescending and convinced that it is too big to fail.   This is the first and likely last review I’ll ever post about anything because of how much I absolutely hate everything about the update and now Snapchat.   By the way, when the lowest you can be rated is 1 and many of your higher ratings were from before the update, I’d say I’m not alone in saying this app is not worth my time anymore. 
I usually don’t write reviews but this new update is pretty rough. I like the overall idea, but having stories and chats on the same page is just a jumbled mess. Don’t even use the app as much anymore
I know you guys aren’t gonna revert the update but please at least do a major bug fix update!!! Ever since the new interface update, my Snapchat is always getting frozen upon opening the app. It’s always getting frozen and then sometimes in the middle of sending snaps, they take FOREVER to send even when I know my connection is perfect, and then sometimes in the middle of me sending snaps the app FORCE CLOSES!!! And then I have almost 150 Snapchat streaks and even when my friends and ME are sending streaks back and forth 3 TIMES A DAY, there are at least 10 hourglasses when I know we’ve been sending stuff!!! And then sometimes multiple streaks of mine will disappear and then I’ll restart my phone and they’ll reappear and if they don’t reappear, they come back the next morning or within a couple of hours!!! This is very annoying and it makes me not wanna use this application anymore!!! PLEASE FIX THIS APP AND THESE BUGS LISTED ABOVE!!!
I did love the snap chat app but the new update is so confusing , I didn’t even want to update it , it just updated by itself!, i liked the messages and stories separate not together. You have to really look for your messages which is more of a struggle. The camera glitches to much it’s annoying . Who came up with the new update? Why did you guys think this was a “great idea” ? I do not understand . I will be deleting the app it’s to stupid now and confusing as hell. Don’t even brother to get it .
IF I COULD GIVE NO STARS I WOULD. PLEEEASE CHANGE THE LAYOUT BACK. YOU GUYS ARE LITERALLY KILLING THE APP W/ ALL OF THESE UPDATES.
it’s trash.. less views & harder to find ppl’s stories! it blows
update is trash, please reverse soon
I have never written a review for another app out of laziness, but the latest update is such a jumbled mess I found the motivation to speak up and trash it. The user interface has zero organization. The snaps you send are mixed in randomly with people who are posting stories and people you haven't messaged in weeks. There is no point in visiting the snap subscriptions anymore as they are put into a "algorithmic order", which means you will be seeing news reports completely   impersonal to you. The only good side is that the improved bitmoji design. If you can avoid this update do it at all costs.
This is the first review I’ve ever written, and the only reason I’m writing it is because I feel so strongly about this. The new updates (over the past six months or so) are absolute garbage. Snapchat is losing favor with high-school and college students in the northeast due to these updates. A majority of my acquaintances have actually even deleted the app due to the nasty new interface and changing privacy updates. If Snapchat, wishes to survive, they should revert back to their older versions, because they won’t be getting a new client base and the new updates will only be wrecking their relationship with their loyal users.
Second Review: I finally decided to delete the application, not that I didn’t like the idea behind Snapchat, but how counterintuitive the user interface became.   First review: Can’t stand the new update, everything is cluttered and it’s causing me to miss snaps and messages. I can’t believe they haven’t changed it back considering the rating is only 2 stars in the App Store. I dislike how the app updates without me updating it from the App Store. 
This update makes it extremely hard to navigate. You miss so many stories, and when you post you lost 1/3 or more of your past views because of how hard it is to view stories. The chats are also all over the place. This is honestly the worst thing to ever come to snapchat.
It needs to go. Really. It’s terrible. I almost despise checking my Snapchat because of how terrible it is. You really should take these one star ratings seriously. Old Snapchat was perfectly fine.
change the update back to the old one. i’m sick & tired of re updating my snap to the old one 3 times a day bc i don’t like the new one. FIX THIS. nobody likes it i don’t understand. your ratings went down from a 5 star to 1 & a half. obviously THERES AN ISSUE. chnage it back or people are gonna stop using the app itself. i’m tired of this.
New update makes it hard to talk to the people you’re currently trying to have a conversation with if you don’t talk to them often. You’ll snap them then they disappear to the bottom of your feed. Then the whole list of stories is too much to concentrate on on the first page. It’s cluttered and I don’t care to see stories of some people. Make it go away please. New update makes me more stressed than I already am. Sincerely a very stressed snap user
This app is amazing ! i love it :) buttttt , the update is like very disgusting , everyone hated it :’/ . please do something ! at least the views part bc i used to get 800 views now its only 400-600 😓😓. Please and thank you !! 💕
great
I don’t understand this new update , go back to the way things was before.
This update has been awful. I want the older one back. I will soon be deleting this app if not changed.
I can’t even find my own story, let alone find anyone else’s. snapchat, wyd
this new update is causing my snapchat to crash a ton. i tried recording videos and it wouldn’t let me because my memories were full so i went to go delete stuff and every time now when i open my memories my snapchat crashes and this has never happened before.
THROW THE WHOLE APP AWAY ITS MAD WACK NOW WITH THIS WEAK UPDATE B
Stories made my feed cluttered, the discover page is good but friends and stories looks cluttered and makes me not want to use it. Separate stories 😫
After the update was made where you don’t have a list of stories in chronological order of your friends everything went down hill. The joy of Snapchat is leaving and the developers aren’t doing anything to have people with iPhones on the same boat as android users by simply not adding another screen with our friends stories
This update is basura(spanish for “trash”) we want the old snapchat back
I agree you guys need to read these and please change it back not a single person at my school likes the new update or anyone in my area, its confusing and no fun please fix
My streaks will not show up on the last few updates. I have to sign out and sign back in for it to come back plus the app redesign isn’t as good as it used to be.
Snapchat is a major part of my life. It’s fun. It keeps me in touch with friends. Most of all, it gives me a platform to create quick works of digital art. I’ve been doing this since they first introduced the emoji sticker feature, and I look forward to continue growing with this weird app. I would also like to add that I really wish I could change my username. I have so many memories saved to my account, there’s no way I can make a new one. But I hate my username. I would pay money to be able to change it. Come on Snapchat please read this.
Snapchat is good but the updates are weird. Everybody’s talking about the new fonts and captions and my Snapchat updated he snap as everyone else’s and it’s showing the updated version without the new fonts and captions it just shows the same stuff from the last update
The update is trash. The fact that your convos are not in order is sooooooo irritating, and I lost most of my streaks bc I couldn’t find my ppl.
I love Snapchat but this new update is horrible ... at least put the stories back to how they were ..
stories and chat should be on separate screens still.
My Snapchat has been slow and kicks me out all the time. It won’t let me take videos and I can’t double tap to reply to people. The update that changed everything was fine even though I hated it. I have this more because I can’t even talk to people now
Bring back the old update
I don’t like the new Snapchat update I used to love Snapchat and get on it everyday but now I don’t use it as much anymore
Snapchat, please die a slow, slow death, worthy of the history books!  Also I'm replacing EA with Snapchat as an example of anti-consumer practices for my students to learn from. 
Worst app update EVER!! It was perfect the way it was, and I don’t appreciate the update that I did not want but got it anyway! You took 10 steps back on this one Snapchat. The developer should be embarrassed of this failure!
Everyone hates the new update. Please snapchat turn it back to the way it was a few weeks ago.
The newest update is very confusing and terrible. The old snapchat was very better!
We need the old Snapchat back the new update makes things difficult.😭
If negative stars were a thing...
First of all I’ve tried leaving a review multiply times over the past few days and it will not let me, so were gonna hope this one goes through. I hate the snaps aren't in chronological order, so I’ll go to open a snap and answer it right after, and it gets shoved lower so I just end up double snapping someone and sometimes not even answer the original person. Also. Just because I don’t talk to everyone I have on snap, doesn’t mean I don’t have them on there for no reason.  Having to search for.a specific story is annoying and I don’t want to see only the discover page or people who’s snap stories are public to anyone. I want to see what my friends are up to even if we don’t actually snap. If snapchat doesn’t go back to how it was before this update I’ll probably stop using it.  Also, it seems like every time I go on snap, I’m being told I’m about to lose another streak with someone that I have been talking to consistently throughout the day. On top of that I have automatic updates turned off and it worked for every other app on my phone except this one. The last two updates have been done without my knowledge and that’s extremely annoying. 
By mashing the personal snaps page and the Snap Story’s page into one, Snapchat has dug itself into a whole that can only be dub out if by reverting back to how it was before it’s most recent update. Please separate the personal snaps and story pages once again and then heavy usage and good reviews will return to Snapchat.
Ever since my phone automatically updated to the new Snapchat layout, the app has noticeably slowed down and stickers take forever to load, but most times they don’t load at all. My phone has also heated up a lot more when I’m on the app, even though everything’s running so slow that nothing is happening.
Straight up trash! Makes me not even want to use it...
This app got a new update that makes it very difficult and confusing!
I don’t like the new update at all I feel like you should change it back to the way it was before this awful update...it’s too confusing and I don’t like how the stories and chats are on the same page it looks ugly and the format of the page where you send snaps is also confusing because I don’t even know what order my best friends list goes in...I also don’t like how someone will snap me but it would be all the way down the page and I feel like it should be in order of who snapped you like how it was before, I’m very un pleased with this update I think you guys are doing the most with it and are bored I would like if you would fix it please
Really surprised that after weeks of backlash Snapchat hasn’t taken back the update. No one asked for Snapchat to be ruined and we were all forced to have this update. No one got a choice. People are going to start leaving your platform so y’all better change it back.
I hated the new update, now I don’t mind it. The multiple captions thing and gifs is fantastic, good job snapchat for keeping up with it. The only problem is with the big update, friend’s personal stories are much harder to find. If you were to put them near the top of the list of stories, snapchat would be great again. Thankyou.
Bring back the old version please, combining feeds has done nothin but make this app more confusing.
the new updated is HORRIBLE HORRIBLE please change it!!!!! thanks
It’s so hard to watch some of celebrities story and meme accounts because they’re all mixed up with random news on discovery. Plz add a button that lets you see everyone’s/ people you can’t follow because they are famous story's without having to tape on each of them
Give us the “clear all” conversations button back - please!!!!
The recent update they did was terrible
Deleting, hate this update.
Newest update format is trash. Twitter is currently winning 🤷🏾‍♀️ 2/26/18
🤬update is trash Myspace died due to unwanted chronic updates. 
Don’t know whose idea this was but fire your development team and go back. I never understand why some companies go against what their consumers want show them we mean business and delete the app till they go back to what so many people loved
Developers need to back up a little and make the app simple and crisp, this is ridiculous  FIX ITTTT !!!!!!!!! 
We want a new update than this crape one
Since you guys updated again and added Giphy stickers, it LITERALLY takes forever to load or sometimes it doesn’t even load!!! Please fix it!!!!
Love snap  Hate the new update where was the revert back to the original we were promised like  it was supposed to happen on the 20th but nope if snap is smart they will go back to the old design before more people start leaving and deleting the app and it becomes the next myspace 
Sending video memories isn’t sending continues to go on and on
I really like Snapchat and I really like to keep up sports news highlights but the latest update it is terrible you can’t delete all conversations:( you have to delete the conversations one by one thats terrible that snap chat did this. I will be deleting this app and go back to my Instagram!
I used to love Snapchat, but after the latest update it is harder to control and I really don’t understand it that much and hopefully the people behind Snapchat will see all these reviews and change it. My stories just all feel so cluttered, and now I hardly look at Snapchat anymore. So thanks for listening to my problems I really hope Snapchat fixes itself.
Snapchat was AMAZING before these past few updates but not it’s just horrible. The way they changed the look is just bad. It’s a lot harder to use and I can’t find all of my friends stories or even their names because of the update. I don’t want to see celebrities stories especially ones I’m not subscribed to...
Don’t get me wrong, I love Snapchat and I’m trying to adjust to this [insert a word to describe the sound *shriek*] of an update. When I looked at what was going to be updated, Snap Inc. said there would be multiple fonts and more text “boxes” and yet I see nothing. That was literally the ONE thing I was looking forward to and I can’t get it. I’ve deleted the app, re-downloaded it, and repeat. Either get rid of the update of fix this problem.   Much distress, Me 
So for some reason Snapchat refuses to cooperate with my phone now that I have done the latest update apple has released for iPhone 11.2.6 I go to open the app and it immediately closes itself every time. I have tried deleting the app and re-downloading it to see if that was the issue and it wasn’t so I am unsure of what is causing it but until it stops messing up it will stay deleted from my phone I hope that this is not just an issue with me cause this is a brand new phone 😬
They never load so what’s the point
No ones getting used to this update change it back
Horrible.
I updated this app and I absolutely hate it. I don't like how the things are on the side instead of the top, or the fact that the timer is gone. But the main thing I Hate is that I can't upload videos from my camera roll that's more than 10 seconds long. That's what my whole story basically consisted of before this update. Please change.
Snapchat is awesome. It’s a great app that me and everyone I know has, or at least has used. It used to be so simple but yet, after the most recent updates, my friends & I are continually finding ourselves sending snaps to the wrong person, sending snaps with deleted text, missing out on stories, and accidentally ignoring one another due to the new layout. It is jumbled and looks cluttered. Please reconsider your most recent changes
You guys need to change it back to the original
I love Snapchat, but the new layout is horrendous. I miss the ease of having the stories and my Snapchats on two separate sections of the app. I don’t watch stories anymore because it’s just messy looking.
Snapchat is now the definition of garbage. I feel like the elderly with a smartphone when I try to operate this outrageous contraption of an app. By far the worst thing ever, if Snapchat could go back to the old format that would be swell.
The update has caused me to no longer want to check what’s happening on Snapchat. The update is to confusing and too much of a hassle to look through all your friends.
Yeah doesn’t fix how horrible this app has become, yeah, still going to stick to insta stories
UPDATE: you’re STILL ignoring what literally everyone is asking for. STOP GROUPING CONVERSATIONS TOGETHER WITH STORIES. NO ONE ASKED FOR THIS. What is so hard for you people to understand?  Words cannot describe how useless, confusing, and unnecessary this update was. I literally cannot understand who felt the need to trash the app like this. Everything is so cluttered and disorganized now that I can’t even tell between my own conversations and a random person’s snap story. On top of that, everything is mixed together so you’re forced to scroll through random peoples’ stories before getting to the person you’re looking for.  There’s no logical system of organization here at ALL. Your snaps and other peoples’ stories aren’t even organized by chronological OR alphabetical order. How they thought was a good idea is BEYOND me. What’s worse is that I thought I had opted out of automatic updates but imagine my surprise when I opened up snapchat today and saw that it had turned to garbage overnight.   Maybe snapchat should actually start listening to their users’ feedback instead of releasing sh*tty updates that serve no purpose other than to confuse their users. This is literally the definition of fixing something that isn’t broken. Stop doing sh*t like this and leave the app alone. 
Please go back to the old version!!! Hopefully u see what I done with the title.                              .•         There all going backwards          •. 
The old snapchat was PERFECT and easy to use. This new update is a SCAM to make more money and make it harder for the user. No longer supporting this app. Used to be great, now one of the worst social media apps out there. If I could give 0 stars I would. Hope that they change it back to how it was.
The new upstate is horrible . After a couple weeks it’s still not practical !!
From someone who would post daily on their story and had over 300+ day streaks, I can honestly say Snapchat will be used barely now if it all.
People that recently post on their stories pop up at the top and maybe my friend was right where the person who just posted was, well now I’m texting the wrong person and I’ve done it a lot it’s annoying take back the update
I feel as though Snapchat came out with yet another awful update that worsens the experience even more.   Hopefully they get the clue that what they’re doing is just not working...   Maybe invest more energy into figuring out how to up the picture and video quality?? 
I am not accustomed to the new updates and I won’t be getting used to. I was just wondering if I could have my Snapchat moved back 2 or 3 updates ago before stories and chats where on the same page other than that everything’s great I love using snap with out all those things but I might just log out.
I honestly used to love this app but through a series of cancerous updates and decisions made by the company it is now easily my least favorite app. You had something good and you destroyed it. I hope your company fails and your families starve to death because of your decisions.  Sincerely, Everyone  P.S.  Do you even have focus groups or do you just release whatever you think is good. 
Since this new update my Snapchat never loads and if it does its extremely slow to the point where I can’t even use it without it crashing.
Snapchat was cool, till the creators updated it, it made snapchat complete 💩💩💩 garbage!!!!!!! About to delete it and i would give it less than 1 star if i could not even worth one star
Put it back to normal, you obviously don’t care about what the people want , that’s why your ratings went down to a 1 lmaoooo
I have no idea why they would update us up to this is so on organize so junking cluttered literally my emoji’s how organized it and how everything is ruined because of the people the CEO of this app made the worst decision possible Thanks to you is so hard for me to tell my friends I want to do this app but I can’t because this is how I communicate with my friends and I Feel disrespected because I did not ask for this update it automatically did it
Fix this confusing update!
Just rewriting my review to say I still hate this update. I may get used to it but I will always want the old Snapchat back. I don't bother watching Snapchat stories anymore.
The new update is horrible and I wish the old layout would come back.
I like the new update (2/26/18). I wish we were able to select which “verified”/celebrity stories to watch though. In the original stories layout, you could select the order in which you could watch stories. Let’s bring that back please🙂
It’s now trash. -Logic
I’ve given the new update time to see if I like it or not. Terrible. I don’t get the hang of it and it’s just too much and confusing. Honestly I feel like I’m slowly starting to use Snapchat less and less everyday. They only reason why I haven’t it’s for my streaks I have with my friends. Other than that, I would have stopped using it since the update happened.. make a better update next time that’s less confusing and listen to your Snapchat users.
Put it back hoe
Honestly, this update is just so dumb and stupid. Why would you do this? Just make it how it used to be. You say it's supposed to be easier but it's not. People were used to the old Snapchat, people liked the old Snapchat. You know why? Cause it was easy to use. Thank you for your time.
Even having restarted the app, reinstalled it and logged out. I still haven’t manage to get any sound.
This update is terrible. Im deleting the app
The new update has made things so awful. To make things worse, the developers have addressed our complaints about it by saying that we’ll just get used to it eventually. Yeah, good luck with waiting for people to get over it while Instagram offers exactly the same service. Will be deleting soon!
I’ll send y’all cookies or something
Haha hi
This update is so bad i can’t even snap people right anymore. I keep on accidentally snapping people who recently posted on their story and it’s really awkward and weird please change it back you saw how happy everyone was when there was that fake news about it going back so why not just bring back the old update???
the update is terrible !!! we want the old layout back
For the Snapchats next update I think that groups could be able to have streaks... just an idea but I’ll hope u consider it🙂
The update is not that good 😪🤧 the fronts don’t show up on my phone so that makes it worst for me to not like the update I got all the updates from snap but it doesn’t work 🤨😭😭😥😓😢🤬😡
i hope you have put thought into consideration that this update was totally not asked for
literally go back to the original.
Snapchat is really cool and a great way to socialize with friends, but this new update does not make sense. It took away the stories were set up in chronological order by time. Also the stories are on the same page as your snapstreaks which can confuse lots of people. In conclusion Snapchat should go back to the version before.
I’ve never watched celebrity or lifestyle stories and this update shoving them down my throat was all I needed to quit using it. You’re not a media company, you’re a video messaging app.
The update that Snapchat release previous is utterly awful and has indirectly led to me not using the app.How so? Well, first the fact that the new story section is filled with people who I don’t even care to watch (this includes people who aren’t listed as MY FRIENDS on the application, but are just trending in the so called snapchat social media community). Also, I’m disappointed that it’s incredibly hard to watch and access the group stories I’m part of. Previously, Snapchat would have a categories in the application’s story section where you could efficiently view your story, others’ and group stories you were part of. Now, it’s showing me what’s new in the life of every Kardashian member, even when I haven’t added them into my follow. In a perfect world, I’m hoping Snapchat will be able to offer something for their users that allows them to opt out of regional stories or keyword finds. What do I mean? Let me explain! First, I’m in a private group with all my friends entitled something that includes a particular type of food. Now, I’m offered stories which pertain to that food. Overall, Snapchat, you were once a convenient and simple platform to operate, but have recently become a system of confusion and mainstream appeal; revert back to your old system or offer a “classic mode” for your users.  Enjoy yourself Snapchat :) 
I LOVE SNAPCHAT BUT GOD DAMNIT CHANGE IT TO WHERE WE CAN WATCH THE STORIES LIKE WE USED TO !!!
I think that not really anyone should have it bc it’s just not appropriate and if kids have it then delete Snapchat thoroughly bc it has really inappropriate content in the explore page
I don't know what are y'all thinking or trying to do but this latest update is horrible. Someone needs to get fired or take the blame for this.   Y'all better fix this soon or go bankrupt... Smh 
I used to love Snapchat. Now I am on the edge of deleting it I hate it so much.
This new update is very cluttered and not very effective to use. I like using Snapchat because it's super quick but I like my stories and messages separated and this is just horrible. I hate it so much and it's a pain in the butt watching people's stories now.
I really don’t like the new version it really NEED to go back soon I think everyone will appreciate it very much
Used to be simple and easy to use and fun . Now it's filled with useless features and hard to use. Pointless stories, and can’t even find friends stories with new update
The new update is horrible! I don’t understand why they won’t change it back if their having this much backlash. Come on! Ratings went down and it won’t be long before some other app comes around to take its place because of it just saying. CHANGE IT BACK!!!!!!!!
Bring back the old layout... this is so stupid
I found that the layout updated automatically even though I didn't update it and I have my automatic updates turned off. Everything is confusing and I don't like how the stories and snap conversations are all mixed up together; I can't find anything and the stories aren't in chronological order! Also, the conversations keep moving around. It's disappointing that they made an update most users didn't ask for, and when there were thousands signing a petition to revert it back, Snapchat responded with no intention of doing so. I understand they're trying to make Snapchat better, but I don't see how the update improves the use of Snapchat.
along with the general setup of the recent update, i can’t stand the feature that allows you to delete and entire text from a snap. after typing, i always adjust where the text is laying in the photo, and 7/10 times i lay it over the little trash can.
There have been many critical reviews about Snapchat in the past regarding the stories. In the past, the stories were on the same side as ads, which people didn’t want to have to see when viewing what their friends posted. Many solutions were suggested, and the Snapchat team really seemed to take them into consideration. Now, you can view stories under the same tab as the messaging tab, and the ads are isolated on their own side for users to explore when they really want to, not when they’re trying to connect with their friends. This has been the best update for Snapchat, and I’d really like to point out how much I appreciate the separation between Ads and social media. I feel very fortunate that the Snapchat team has taken our reviews into consideration, and I’d like to encourage them to keep up the good work. The app is almost as good as it can get in my eyes, but before I move on to the issues with the app, I would like to point out that moving the stories to the messaging page is a great improvement. My only issue is that it forces you to watch the stories before sending messages. This is a really small issue and I have a very simple solution that I believe will help meet the concerns myself and other critics, those who like the update and don’t. If you just have two lines for each friend, one for stories and one for messages, then the problem would be solved. Keep in mind, this would be on the same page. There’s just more lines on it. For instance, if you have a friend Bob and he uploads a story, there’s a message icon with the name Bob next to it on the same line which activates messages, and there’s a different icon below it on a different line with the name Bob next to it, which you can click on to activate the story. If you’re struggling with ideas for the story icon design, the three circles in a triangular formation which used to be the stories icon would work perfectly in my mind. You could also implement a thumbnail for the story instead of the icon but have the icon show up instead of the thumbnail if the friend has no stories. Essentially, it’s gonna take up the same amount of space as another friend in the messaging side, but it has a different icon. I don’t believe it’ll be much of an issue in terms of space, especially if it shows up under the message icon of the same friend. If this isn’t making much sense, I’d be happy to send an email to describe the solution and maybe send some pictures of what the app would look like with the addition. Thank you sincerely for connecting with your customers. Even though the score for the app has gone down, I am seeing improvement, and I think some of us need to appreciate that because the app certainly had more issues in the past. I’m excited for the next update, but please, keep the stories on the messages side. I really like this feature, it just needs a quick fix.
This update is awful! I’m about to literally delete the app if it doesn’t get updated back to normal. This is was too complicated to use and I’m pretty sure I speak for every user when I say this was a bad call by the creators. Change it back. Like even celebrities are talking bad about this app now! Your ratings have tanked and you need to think about your users.
lit
This update is trash nobody likes it please get the old one back
this update is so unorganized and cluttered together. I’d much rather have the old version that we all miss!! The stories aren’t in chronological order, and I would prefer that my stories be on one side and my chats being on the other. It’s really confusing.. bring back old update!!!
I love Snapchat and I use it everyday, and the new update it HORRIBLE!!! It’s hard to view stories and respond to people. Please go back to normal :/
You’re not letting me login!!
Snapchat, y’all had it going with the previous version of the app. It was clean, organized, and satisfying to use. Unfortunately, for some reason you decided to change the interface completely. Usually, updates make the app better and more satisfying to use. Even if the layout is different, it makes sense and everyone eventually gets used to it. But this time you just f**cked everything up. Before, the stories and message feed were sorted by the most recent time sent/received/posted. Stories and snap messages were separate. All your friends were sorted by alphabetical order. That interface made SENSE. Now, it’s not sorted by time or alphabet. It doesn’t seem to be sorted by any means. The feed looks disorganized and ugly. It’s harder to pick and choose which stories I want to watch. The irrelevant people in my life make it to the top of my feed (no offense) while my best friends are on the bottom??? Snapchat has become less fun and more frustrating to use. Please fix it bc I really like this app.
Very confusing !!!!
The application was great just before the latest upgrade, I don't like the auto advance story and now the application starts to "freeze" and it's not working as it use to do before this last change. Please change the new update to the old one.
You need to get rid of this new update. Version 10.25.0 & up are ruining the snap community. It messes up your viewer count, it’s complicated, unnecessary, ugly looking. To stop the complaints just go back to Version 10.24.5. Thank you.
Please release a new update that doesn’t have the story’s and chat on the same screen
Y’all can do better
New update is wack. I don’t like it. Change it back.
This new update is the worst don’t update something that isn’t broken or messed up I barely use Snapchat anymore now due to this new update
Petty af Snapchat! SWITCH IT BACK!
I hate this new update I miss the old Snapchat the only reason I keep it right now is because some of my friends don't have a Facebook to share stuff with. Very disappointed
I've used snapchat forever and they have always delivered with interesting content on updates until most recently. I have done my best to avoid downloading it but now I am stuck with it. I don't know why snapchat would make such a bad decision or why they are ignoring their customers but please fix snapchat!!!!
please bring back the old version and i promise the rating is gonna go back up as fast as it went down :(
Update is trash
Still hated the new update i use to be more active on snapchat 💔
It crashes way too much
The update is so stupid change it back to the old way
I tried but I just can’t, this update is something I can’t get used to. I hate how the news is mixed with people I follow. I don’t even view their stories anymore, i just view my friends stories, it’s all just a cluttered mess. Just did an update right now and I thought it would fix the problem but it didn’t. I never write reviews for apps but this is my favorite app so I had to and I gave it 4 stars because it’s just the clutter in news mixed with stories that bothers me.
I love this app but change it back I don’t know how to use the new update
Everybody I know, hates the new format of Snapchat. The users are unhappy and things should go back how they used to be. The recent update is terrible!
Stories are hidden. You have to page through the list of friends to see who has a story. What’s the point
For real, guys? This update is ugly, not functional and you know it. Let’s go back to the basics. I also see sooo many ads now! Because stories can play one after the other, that’s convenient. But, as a consequence, there are many more ads. Let’s be real guys, this was a marketing scheme to make more money.
Hi im ibrahim aldossary   My snap chat iii2552   Please i want now change my update to old one okay !! 
I really honestly can not STAND this stupid update. i’m loosing views and streaks because of this not to mention i can’t watch none of my close friends snaps because i don’t know where they are. Please bring back the old snapchat
WE HATE THIS UPDATE & YOU ALL WILL BE GETTING A 1 STAR RATE EVERY SINGLE DAY UNTIL YOU ALL CHANGE IT BACK!!!!!!
This new update is terrible and it’s not going to get any better. A friend of mine has had this update for while and it Doesn’t Get Better. Deleted the app because I’m not on Snapchat to watch random people’s stories.
The update is ugly, hard to use, complicated and just a pain. Get rid of it nobody wants it!
I absolutely love Snapchat I use it everyday ! I text people on Snapchat and send pics . The new update is the only problem I have with Snapchat it is horrible. My whole school and family agrees . I love Snapchat but hate the update . It’s a love / hate relationship. Snapchat has been around for a long time. I also love the idea of streaks ! I have lots of streaks . Please fix the update !!!!
I’m angry about this update. It’s ugly and WAY too busy. also way too much focus on the discover stories. I don’t want to have to have recently snap chatted a person to see their story. This update is ugly and you should take it back. Act like it never happened.
Worse updated than a starving child in Ethiopia
This App trash AF...  I’d give it 0 stars if I could... Word to ya motha.
The new update is terrible. I can’t find anyone’s story. I have started using Instagram stories instead. I will not return to Snapchat unless the issues are fixed.
Snapchat used to be my favorite app but when the new update came I lost all of my views.... and it’s hard to watch my friends stories and when I am texting someone it goes all the way to the bottom and I don’t know when they text me. All I am asking for is the old Snapchat because this new update is crap! It makes me want to uninstall the app because it’s that bad!
There are too many features to keep up with, and one of the key components that made Snapchat fun -accessibility- has been stagnated. The thing about Snapchat is that it's a temporary chat and a daily diary. Putting people's stories next to their messages can confuse conversations. Having all the chat groups up at the top of left convo page is really confusing. If they're going to keep this format, they need to make the "My Story" button much bigger than the others because against the black background your eye gets lost jumping to other selection options.
I hated it when it first updated and I still hate it now. Difficult to watch the stories I want and it’s boring to have everything all together it takes the fun out of it
I love using snapchat to talk to friends but this new update is terrible, I’m confused by the entire app now.
first of all none of us like this update and that is partially why you’re receiving this god awful review! this update is also very glitchy because i had a streak with one of my friend and it was almost at 50 and we both sent streaks meaning it should go away BUT THIS GOD AWFUL UPDATE TOOK AWAY MY STREAK AND IM ANGRY. you should change it back to the old update, i would suggest it bc you guys only have a 1.8 star review right now on the app store and i’m sure it’ll keep going down
My isn’t updated to the news fonts and there’s nothing to update when I look for it
i absolutely love the new update. its more organized and i love how the stories are on the chat side now. I dont care what anyone says but the new update is amazing. i also really love how the subscribed side is bogger panels and its way easier to read!! keep up the good work!
I love it and all but I hate the new update
Please :(
Not good. I've changed my password three f*cking times to get rid of the update and every time it comes back. Can't see the celebrities I like to watch & their stories because the news and Olympic stories are put ABOVE the people I want to watch. So stupid.
The update is horrible and I am going to delete my account and be done with Snapchat. Unless they go back to the old design if not oh well
This app is amazing just bring the old snap back. This new update is total garbage and everyone i know agrees with me, Nobody likes it. I am adding on to this review now. I cant believe that they managed to make the ui even WORSE after the last update. I thought “oh, it will probably get better” but no, it didnt. Just please give us the old snapchat, thats all we want.
The new update is horrifying to look at and ridiculously hard to use the way I want to. Please bring back the old format! I tried to give the new update a chance and I just can’t deal with it anymore. I used to like Snapchat.
We used to have fun together, my reason for opening my phone, now things have gotten complicated and I no longer have these feelings. I’m sorry but you can no longer have space on my phone I hope you don’t forget my memories like MySpace, until you get your act together bye.    SparkyD  P.s. I miss the old you!! Please come back! 
Since the new update came out the snapchat has been the worst app and social media OF ALL TIME so we hope the next update will be the old version plssssss
FIX THE NEW UPDATE NO ONE LIKES IT TAKE US BACK TO THE OLD ONE
Still haven’t changed it back???? This is actually ridiculous I hate snap now it used to be the only app I used
I like everything except the stories and it no longer lets me know when I’m losing a streak.
The simple layout was so much better. Please bring it back
GIVE US THE OLD SC BACK!
I rlly like SC but the latest upgrade is the worst. U don’t understand what is going on!!!! 😒😒😒. I simply hate it.
Fix this terrible update
I kinda like the latest update. It’s easier to find everyone’s stories and all my group chats. I’m impressed with it. Obviously it’s gonna take some time to get used to but overall I like it.👍🏼
Usually I get used to major updates on social media platforms, not this time. It’s been 2 weeks or so and I still hate it. I had never ONCE used Instagram stories until you guys came up with this horrible update. Now I hardly open Snapchat anymore. So if your goal was losing “customers” you did great. I would highly suggest bringing back the old Snapchat, even Kylie Jenner who literally posted every 2 seconds hardly uses it anymore. Ha.
Snapchat is really the only social media I use but I would like a one time snapchat name change to be implemented
Horrible idea putting the personal snaps in the same spot as stories. I have to scroll down past stories that are older than the snap I'm looking for that I just got.
This latest update is NOT user friendly!
I don’t like the new layout of the app, it makes watching friends stories take a long time. It also takes forever to find the magazine I’m looking for now. And I hate celebrity stories and they keep showing up. It’s terrible in those was. I do however like all of the newer filters.   Also a suggestion for the next update would be some way to quickly choose messages from a certain day to load, or view all attachments sent. 
Don’t waste your time downloading this app. They only care about making money and ruining user experience.
Please change it back
i used to love snapchat but the new update makes it hard to watch my favorite influencers stories. I don’t like that i get more articles or ads from companies instead of viewing the content i’d like.
Please go back to the original version!!! I don’t like this update!!!!!!
Boooooo! The new update sucksss. go back to the old version.
The app is traassshh don’t download it. The app was good before but now it’s very very bad
Didn’t mind the update at first and now it is actually so bad everything is mixed up and idk what I sent and what is a story and literally no one uses the discover page so just all I’m asking is PUT A STORIES PAGE ON THERE AND TAKE THE STORIES OFF UR MESSAGE PAGE
this has got to be one of the worst updates in the apple store history. fix this
i’m about to delete snap. this update is so dumb. it sends snaps to the wrong people. i’m sick of my stuff not loading.
This update is just a complete mess. Even Kylie Jenner hates it. There is absolutely no point to have famous people stories on one complete side ? I hate having people i’m not cool next to people i’m cool with and seeing there stories mixed with my friends story’s and them making it to the top of my list. It’s dumb and I hate it. I don’t understand why you guys aren’t changing it back🤦🏽‍♀️
This app is so Doo Doo Now Why Would ya make this the update change it back Right Now Before i Get maddddd I’m Not playingggggg
Love this app so much
I loved Snapchat. It was my main app. Now with this new update I don’t even enjoy it.
With the recent update everything is much more confusing and not as fun as how it was to see snaps
Snapchat would be 100x better if it went back to the way it way ?!
for years I've been using Snapchat but now I don't really want to use anymore even though I have so many streaks the update is so cluttered and messy and I can't really use it anymore. now my Snapchat is glitching too and I can't really use it. i used to use Snapchat every single day but now I can't really use it because it doesn't make sense to me. I lost so many streaks I lost my highest streak that was 700. there should be an option to make sc go to the old format bc most ppl don't like this. i'm debating on deleting it soon if it doesn't get changed. don't get me wrong i used to love sc w all my heart but not anymore i've been using it ever since they had u pay for replays and filters. i used to love it but y'all just messed it up.
Fix the bugs keeps crashing
Don’t like the new layout but I’m slowly adjusting. Really don’t like how all the stories are together anymore though.  All gifs should have sections on the bar like sticker sets and the emojis 
My main problems with the new update are that: 1) Snapchat now can put promotions ahead of any of your friends who choose to have public stories, or people you actually follow.  2) Unless you want to watch all stories in the order Snapchat chooses (and it will change randomly due to what I assume is a glitch) you cannot view stories in alphabetical order or separate from your conversations anymore.  3) It’s easy to lose track of who you were talking to earlier in time because of the combination of stories with your personal conversation threads.   In conclusion, I would suggest that anyone not already invested in Snapchat with their friend group DO NOT start using this app. It’s too confusing now and is not nearly as useful or convenient as it used to be.   Before the update, all we had to worry about was freezing and black screens, as well as a few unpatched camera glitches (no manual focus anymore, black images, and when videos get stuck recording and just produce a picture), but now we have to worry about poor fundamental function of the app. Not worth using, but the only communication medium of its kind, so I choose to give it 1 star instead of zero. 
Hate the app after the update I just use IG stories now
i love snapchat but it kept closing on me and i cant send or take a picture with it constantly shutting down and ive tried reinstalling it or restarting my phone but nothing?
The new update is a mess!
SnapChat is still trash bring back the old SnapChat
We want old snap back
Y’all are making Snapchat more and more difficult. Stop with the updates and bring back the old snap.
With the new update(updated by itself)my timeline is hard to follow... doesn't flow, merges the timeline and chat, also separates the celebs you follow and puts them on the discover page and throws in all these other stories that have nothing to do who you follow, much less entertaining also the discover page’s story is non stop and smooth unlike your actual friend timeline. I don’t follow any Kardashians yet I'm forced to give them views when i watch the celebs i do follow on the discover page.
This is app is trash . simple.
i love to use snapchat. i love snapchating my friends and other things but i just can’t with the new update. please please change it back
The UI is awful now, and I can't believe they allowed this to go through just to generate more ad revenue.
It’s sad when the app goes from a 5 star app to a 1!!!! Star app.
I HATE THIS UPDATE
I was 100% against the update that turned the world upside down. Unfortunately, a zero star review was not an option at the time. Since then, Snap Inc. has been adamant about the consumer giving that update a chance. So, after leaving a low review and signing a petition to change it back (~1.25 million signatures), another update made things a tad better. “A tad better” should be taken is a relative view considering my opinion of them was lower than a well digger’s shoes. The sent/received feed is still extremely cluttered, and the tabs for stories and groups are still a little off. They’ll get there, but two stars for now.  *** stories came back into my news feed. I downgraded to 1-Star. 
New update makes it trash😴.
Looks awful and over crowded with the newest update. Plus ever since this update i have turned off my “automatic update” so this won’t happen to me again with other apps. 
The new update makes the app useless. The new format is confusing and has me looking for an alternative.
Have you guys seriously not done absolutely anything. You had almost 5 stars and dropped almost instantly to a 1.8 stars. Shouldn’t that be a wake up call.... No one likes the update, change it
this new update is terrible!!!
Great app. Hate the update.
I’m going to make this short and brief. The update. That is all. The update.
I used to love snap chat but now the update makes it annoying to use and I hardly use it anymore
Pretty much like everyone else who uses this app agrees. The new update isn’t great, far from it actually. The old style was perfect the way it was, and I understand the importance of keeping things fresh and updated but this was a waste of an update. All you have to do is just bring back the way snapchat was and the way people loved it. If you guys do that you will get your 5 star rating back
Y'all already know you messed up with the update
i loved snapchat, it was my life. i’m a teenager so why wouldn’t it be? the new update is SO ugly i’m sorry snapchat. it needs to be fixed, so many ppl have been posting about it and ppl are even finding hacks to get rid of the update. not a fan of our new update and ik you can do better:) There are WAY too many bugs and my snapchat crashes every 10 seconds!! cOME ON SNAPCHAT!!
I know a lot of people hate the updates, but honestly it is so much better!! You people don't understand that sc is actually really good so stop hating
before i begin, i would like to say that i think snapchat is a great app! it is definitely one of the most used apps on my phone and for sure one of my daily drivers. that being said, this update is awful! so confusing, so cluttered, and so unappealing. the bitmoji advancements are great and so are the new fonts, but overall the update is a train wreck. please give us back the old layout or a new one similar to it because this is NOT working. if it’s not broken, why fix it?
L
I wish there was a no stars rating option because since you guys made this latest update i no longer use Snapchat . Snapchat has been one of my favorite apps since it became popular and now you guys have ruined everything . Snapchat was great as it was . Ever hear the saying “ if it ain’t broke don’t fix it “ ??? You guys should’ve left things as is . I literally do not open the app anymore . That update was the death of a great thing . Get it together people !!!
Take me back to the old Snapchat. Remember what happened to vine.
No one really cares about liberal arts because it’s trash
I got SnapChat a couple years ago, and it alright. I stopped using it for 2 years then downloaded it again because my friends urged me to. The reason I stopped using the app is because I didn’t know how to work it, it was all new to me compared to Instagram, and I was young. I realized it was actually really easy to use once you get used to it. Everything was just like I liked it to be. The specific people (Mashable, Daily Mail, etc.), were right under my friends stories. With this update, I don’t enjoy using SnapChat anymore. Every time I want to view my friends stories, I only get random stories from people I’m not even subscribed to and random YouTuber stories as well. It’s not until I scroll at the very bottom I see my friends stories. I once loved this app, and now it’s just making me hate it. Please go back to the old version of SnapChat. The only reason I still have this app downloaded is because I have streaks with people. If I didn’t, I would’ve kissed this app goodbye a loooooong time ago. This update also has a few glitches too, which is making me consider just deleting SnapChat altogether, even if it means losing my streaks.
زي المنب قايله واللهي
Dear Snapchat, you should make an update to where you don’t have to hold the record button down. You can just pick how many snaps you want it to record (I.e. 6seconds, 12seconds, 18seconds..etc) and than once you press it you can set it down and let it record or flip the camera around and record without worrying about moving your finger off the button.
Really man really :| so y’all decide to update but don’t change the layout back to its original way? Disappointing...... Tbh y’all should read the reviews of your app cause this is what the people want (¬_¬)
PLEASE just separate who I snapchat ans people’s story’s...
Could this stupid app get any worse ?! goodness STOP and redo what ever the hell you did this app is so trash I can’t wait till something LIKE the old Snapchat comes out so I can stop using Snapchat.
The update made it more difficult to snap the right person and find who you’re trying to snap chat I’m waiting for someone to make a better social app. Snapchat is dying and I’m ready for it now
BRUHHHH LEMME TELL YOU, the update is garbage, el fin 🤷🏽‍♀️ (the end)
I use to love snap. And I loved how all of my stories were on one page no matter if they were from famous people or not but now it’s really upsetting because I have my friends stories on one side of the app and subscriptions on the other and then on top of that you throw in stuff from days before the whole point of Snapchat is that anything you post has a 24 hour life not a 48 hour life or even a 72 hour life. Also sending me recommendations on people who I don’t even know. Giving me previews of what they are doing on their story, doing god knows what. Like I don’t care. If I really wanted to find them and watch their story then I would take an effort to find them. Also I would nickname the famous people and then they don’t even show up. Like why would you offer that option if it isn’t even gonna work. ☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️
it was better before the update, now it is really hard to see your friends storys and the storys are not even on cronological order:(
Your latest update is total garbage. Thank you for giving me all my time back.
Even the few corporate stories I was interested in (I hated the integrated face as well, everyone’s trying to sell something) are impossible to find after the new update. I can’t watch my friends stories easily and I’ve noticed a significant decline in posting. If it doesn’t get fixed I’m sure I’ll delete the app soon. 
snapchat used to be my number 1 favorite and most used app. Now, I can barely stand opening it. The new update is unnecessarily difficult to use and navigate. A lot of people I know have literally re-downloaded facebook to use instead of snapchat.
odio la nueva actualización pues ahora tengo que buscar entre todos los contactos las historias de mis amigos y los que no publican tan seguido y ademas buscar aparte los amigos que no tienen restricciones para que todo mundo vea sus publicaciones esto es un asco de actualización 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
I used to be all about Snapchat i used it more than Instagram but then jus update came and now I’ve lost all my streaks and just stopped using it. The update is so confusing and I’m super disappointed because i really loved the app
the last update is horrible, I just dont like it. I dont want to even use it anymore.
the update is bad change it back
I really didn’t like the new update.
i was starting to get used to the snapchat chat update, but i’m losing a lot of my streaks once i have been sending streaks every 5 seconds and the person snapchat backs. please recover them.
snapchat you went from almost a five star rating to a one star rating...i wonder why, you changed the system too much it’s so hard to work now
I hate the new update, I want the last, this is soo bad. Very disappointed
This new platform is horrible. It's been over a week now and still hasn't been fixed. This is now one of the worst apps and personally I'm using it less and less.
Danny DeVito would say it’s garbage then eat it
hey Snapchat I would request to make a new update that isn’t confusing like the one we have right now! I would also suggest for our streaks to be in a separate list so we can send them faster and we don’t have to go search them individually one by one to send streaks! This app is amazing but I would just add a better update and what I said above! Thank you for everything! 💘
Snapchat used to be the best app ever it was the most fun for social media but ever since the new update I've been using it less and less. It's been really annoying and I've lost a lot of streaks because of it. You can keep the new look where the users Bitmoji is next to there name and the different fonts for typing, but please put stories on the other slide. I hate having the stories cluttered with my streaks it's annoying and hard to see everyone's snap and story separately.
I really liked snap chat before the new update but now it’s so unorganized. At least the recents page is. I can never find my snaps Bc people I don’t even talk to on a daily basis stories are hiding them. Please atleast fix that one or change it back. And how come on my updated best friends list my top best friend (with 2 pink hearts) isn’t my top best friend anymore. Also it says I lose streaks all the time and then 24 hours later if I haven’t really lost them they come back and then the process repeats
WITH THE NEW UPDATE NO ONE USE IT SO THAT IT FORCES THEM TO MAKE THE OLD ONE COME BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!
if i could give 0 stars, i would. this update is ruining everything. there isn’t a single person that actually likes these updates so i don’t understand why you’re making it worse and worse. the only people that don’t hate it are okay with it but there’s absolutely no one that’s ecstatic or even remotely happy with these updates. your ratings dropped so low the moment you made that one terrible update. bring back the old snap.
The update is so bad. I don’t even want to use the app anymore. Please change it back.
Loved the app before the update
Everyone hates the new update it is too much y’all need to absolutely change it back quickly or everyone is going to get rid  of it
Trash
I have used this app since 2013.  The day my phone updated to the new layout I ended up deleting it.  The new layout is so convoluted and obnoxious to use.  No chronological snaps AND stories mixed in, seriously?  Who approved this?  What incentive would I ever have to swipe over to the discover page?  Truly unfortunate.  I will be using Instagram stories from now on.  The arrogance of the CEO doubling down also indicates his disdain towards his user base. 
THIS NEW SNAPCHAT UPDATE THING IS HORRIBLE BRING BACK GOOD SNAP 😭
Literally everyone hates it
Use to go on everyday, now I'm probably gonna delete it  So cluttered 
My Snapchat is now very laggy whenever I open a snap and it does not seem smooth and crisp like it once was. I also do not like the format because I can never find snap names anymore.
Snapchat was once a great app used by all and it united us in ways we had never experienced. However, one fateful day greed took over Snapchat and they said to hell with our loyal users and they removed the stories of all of our friends and replaced it with ads and “news”. Unless you talk to a specific person daily then be prepared to scroll through a long list of chats before finding their story.
I used to use Snapchat all the time now not as much. The update changed too much and it is very messy and confusing and out of order. I hardly use it now and hope they change it back to the old format
I’ve been using Snapchat for years now. As far back as when we could see other people’s best friends. Now i have an update that i didn’t even request for. Woke up one day to what i call an utter disappointment. Updates are made to make to enhance & make it more efficient. This was a waste of an update & the end to such a great app. Not only is the app now messy & cluttered, it’s also a nuisance. It should have not taken me more than 5 minutes to figure out how to add a snap to my story. Plus why are you showing me stories of people I’ve never even watched? Why force the discover page to be seen? Now keeping streaks is ten times harder. As if snap ads weren’t enough, the Snapchat Team has found yet another way to ruin the app. GO BACK TO THE OLD LAYOUT.
Thank you for listening to your consumers! I love the update!
I love snapchat but it’s so sad and poor that you can’t even call someone to help you out when you have a problem with the app. I know you can email them but my problem isn’t even listed so I have to make a whole new account. That’s the only flaw about the app.
ابو كلب ذا التحديث وبسس .
Still don't like the look of the new Snapchat please change it back
The redesign is terrible. I don’t even open this app anymore.
Your rating have plummeted. Listen to your users and change it back before you lose another billion
why did you change it? i hate it sm and it makes me not want to use snap anymore
Ew
Honestly used to love Snapchat but the fact that they know we hate this update and they aren’t fixing it because they’re profiting anyways, pisses me off to no extent. I rarely go on anymore.
If you give me the new update one mo time im finna lunch you we could most definitely link up who ever made this new update
Snapchat used to be my favorite app. After he update i ditched it! I would use it for personal and business purposes! I am moving my business somewhere else because it is just so confusing, stupid, and cluttered! Who thought of this update? I'm so confused on why they would make it a million times worse! Ever heard of if it ain't broke don't try fixing it 🙄
It’s too much now...
Hate this update ‼️‼️‼️‼️ GO BACK WE STILL HATE IT
It’s just bad with the new update
Yo was the person who made this update like actually high? Weed's great and all but you gotta know your limits, bro.
I hate this new snapchat
This new app just makes everything cluttered. It’s unorganized. For one thing Snapchat says we’ll get use to it. When an update comes out usually we are raving about how awesome it is. When most users hate it it’s not we will get use to it. You made a mistake and fix it. This update doesn’t make Snapchat fun anymore. Just because I don’t talk to a person as much anymore doesn’t mean I don’t want to see what’s going on in their lives.  Also in response to the celebrity/news page. We know celebrities aren’t our friends, but that’s the whole purpose of it. Feeling like we are. That’s how celebrities get fans. Making them feel like we are a family. Now that snap doesn’t have that we will have to go to the only app that does do that. Instagram, were we follow our friend celebrities and watch their stores on their because they are our ‘friends’. 
Snapchat is fine the way it is, send and receive photos and videos, and nobody needs your "news". Doing too much.
This new update is the worst decision ever. I never use snapchat anymore because the update is to confusing to work. Please change back
Let's go back to having separate stories please
Does anyone from snapchat read the reviews? We all hate the update! Fix it! It’s too confusing the way it is now.
STRONGLY DISLIKE THE NEW UPDATE...SO CONFUSING!!
It was good while it lasted..
Me and my friend had a streak and it was pretty high like 300 and now it’s gone I think we should earn it back my other friend lost hers and got it back from the owners of Snapchat so I think mine should come back
At first I hated the update but, I’m used to it now lol , still a little annoying but hey the app is still addicting
If I could give this 0 stars, I would. I hate this update!!!! FIX IT SNAPCHAT! I can’t navigate your app anymore!! GET ON IT NOWWWWWW
Although I got the last update, still the fonts are not appearing !!!
Snapchat used be a great app but since the update it’s a mess and useless. Who thought this was a good idea? You honestly saw this update before releasing it to the masses and thought it made the app better or was a good idea? The old version worked and made sense it was organized and flowed well but now it’s just a huge unorganized blob of horror. No thanks deleting app
I enjoy Snape Chat as one of the best programs for me
Trash
That’s all. Bring the old Snapchat back. We didn’t ask for THIS..
So y’all really not gone change it back
Another thing I wanted to say about the update is you always say problems fixed but really you guys haven’t fixed anything every time you look at reviews you completely ignore everything everyone is saying. Maybe somethings just aren’t meant to be changed. I think it’s time to change the update back to the old Snapchat I’m tired of how the set up is I didn’t ask for this update and neither did anyone else.
WE HATE THE NEW UPDATE!!   Sincerely, Everyone 
Not only is the UI the worst. I keep kicked out from the app and have to re-log in every time at least 10 times a day. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app still have the same issue. Fun while it lasted but i might not use this app until it gets fixed.
I used to love snap so much but now I don't even go on because of how bad the new update is...... it's AWFUL!!!! I'm surprised they haven't fixed it yet literally no one likes it :( pls switch it back!!!
This update was extremely unnecessary. Also bring the conversation peeking back.
After the update it was terrible and hard to get around
Snapchat was a great app. Now, because of the stupid update, I don’t even want to use it anymore. Now they go and make it worse by adding three sections to what used to be the chat, it is now “all”, “stories”, and “groups”. This is too stupid and unnecessary. I’m tempted to delete the app overall (but I won’t because I have a 103 day streak to keep).
Please make us Able to do other things on Snapchat while calling people on it or using snap time. Cause any time I try to leave the persons box that I’m calling it hangs up and o have other chats to open.
I used to really like this app but now it’s changed way to much It’s gone over board .
Definitely going to delete my Snapchat now this update is very stupid. Just irritated my soul!!
FIX THIS UPDATE // CHANGE IT BACK TO THE WAY IT WAS
I barely use Snapchat anymore. No one wants a small fix to the new update people just want you to bring the older version back.
The latest snap update is sh?t! I can't view my friends stories like I used to be able to! How can you make something that wasn't that good, worse, Snapchat?! It's almost as if you don't want people to use your app. If that's your goal, then you've achieved it, congrats! If you want a new phone, download Snapchat because you'll throw your phone on the ground. Hence the new phone. Plain and simple, don't waist your time with this app. WORST APP EVER!!!!!!
. Reverse it
You said you were bringing back the old Snapchat on February 20th and you got everybody hyped up for no reason. So you bring back the old snapchat or no??
It’s horrible, I’m confused. No one likes it change it immediately
So disorganized - my OCD can’t handle it - off to Instagram unless you update it back :( bye 👋🏼👋🏼
No one likes the new update. Seriously considering deleting the app since it's basically useless and drains my battery.
Just go back may people are leaving and I just about had it if you don’t do anything just going to IG only
okay, so i’ve had snapchat for a while now and i can completely agree with other people that the new update is bad. it brought down my views and also it’s just in general really confusing... snapchats rating have gone down to 1.8 so i’m pretty sure it’s time to either do something about it, otherwise people are gonna just find another app that is better. BUT, the old snapchat was really good and fun, and YES the bitmoji stuff now is cool so keep that! but everything else is just-😴😴😴😴😴
I love Snapchat but the new update is just ugly and the newest update that came out last week I don’t even have it yet!!🙄 it’s so annoying ALSO ME AND MY FRIEND HAD 29 STREAKS AND SHE OPENED AN HOUR AGO AND WE LOST IT RN!!! 😡
I hate the new update(updates) they are just too messy and complicated I liked the older update better. I feel like Snapchat just gets more annoying every update. :/
Please redo the update. it’s So bad. Most people are unhappy.
snapchat used to be lit but these updates are real nasty
Fr Snapchat? Not one soul on this planet likes this trash update yet y'all decide to keep it. Give us back old Snapchat so you can be loved again.
This update has ruined snap
Bring back the old snap it was so much easier to use and now it just makes me want to delete it because I get annoyed when trying to use it!!!!!!!!
Instead of updating the apps looks you should focus on the fact that all it does is crash. Please fix this problem.
this updates annoying and hideous. i hate it!! i deleted snapchat for a long time. SNAPCHAT IS THE WORST APP EVERR
Bring back old snap new update is confusing and difficult to use I love snap but not as much anymore
This is stupid change it back
I used to love this app but the new update ruined it. I don’t like that you move my messages around to put people who added to their snap story at the top I DON’T CARE IF SOMEONE POSTS SOMETHING NEW. Leave my messages alone. I also hate the new set up of the stories and who I’m friends with. Mashing together my friends with random companies was a terrible idea. And why can’t I watch my own story anymore?? You ruined Snapchat. RIP
This app is broken now.
The update is absolutely awful it’s ridiculous. This app went from the best to the absolute worst it went from bold and brash to more like belongs in the trash.
I’m happy with the new updates! However, please change the conversation board back to how it was before so you only see who you are chatting with and not everybody’s story in the way! Like it’s annoying to see other names who I don’t chat with on a daily bases and I prefer to only see who I’m currently having a conversation with. I would rate higher if this would change. Until then, low rates.
I don’t like the update AT ALL and I’m loosing interest in Snapchat as well now.
the update is truly disappointing and id use snapchat again if they got rid of the update itself everyone i know strongly dislikes it
Jumbled, confusing, stories, notifications all in your face and you don't know what to do. Snapchat needs to go back.
Okay since the update I use the app like twice a week. And instead of listening to the customers they keep on updating for the worse. And its the little things they do that piss me off.like why don’t you let us change our names or something more useful. CEO of snapshat WHAT THE HELL MAN🙄I don’t even want to open the app no more.
Update is atrocious, very cluttered and makes me want to delete(and I really enjoy Snapchat), it also won’t let me open my group chats, every time I press on them the app shuts down. I’ve tried restarting my phone, deleting the app and reinstalling, but nothing works. Please, please fix this.😫🤬
FIX THE STREAKS. GOD.
Before the update SC was fine just needed a few minor adjustments (ability to change our @ name and having profile pictures) but now it’s completely useless. I never get on Snapchat anymore because I hate the look.
I don’t like how they updated to a new version. The story and text are 2 in 1, and if I want to save the conversation I have to do it 1 by 1 :(
snapchat is so cool it even uses bitmoji
I used to love using Snapchat, but now it’s annoying. I see people’s snaps that I really don’t care about, whenever I message someone it goes to the very bottom 😑 it’s really annoying.
Snapchat is actually a really fun app. I can talk to friends anywhere I want. I love Snapchat. But what I don’t like about Snapchat is that the updates makes users a bit angry. Like the update where Snapchat changed the whole layout makes Snapchat harder to use. But the Snapchat updates isn’t all bad. The update where you can change the fonts is actually a great one. I can be more creative about it
New update is booty. Not the good kind
I love ittt!!!!
Just isn’t the same..
Bring back the old update
It’s just trash
I used to receive all the stories of people who I don't even care about. Now all of those people moved to the gram. So glad. Thank you Snap Chat! (Your the only ones who get us young people)
This update ruined Snapchat. It is awful
change it back to how it was !!!!
This app is horrible now
Snapchat use to be my main app, but once they changed the lay out in early February, I hardly use it now. The new layout is stupid and to me, unorganized. I can’t find a lot of my friends and I have to search for their stories. I wish Snapchat would just change it back!
L
After the last update my app has been constantly freezing in the middle of a story.
Preferred it before the update that merged everything together.
The new Bitmoji updates are cool but I dislike the new version of the stories being combined with messages. The old version was much better.
The new update is horrible. You would think the company would give us want we wanted, but instead they tell us to get use to it.
...until the update. I rarely check it anymore. I really wish there was a way to downgrade my Snapchat. The discover page should not have the popular people, ads, and stories of people you think I should follow/subscribe to. Ps: the subscribed tab doesn’t help, because I would like all of the stories to be in one place! Not popular vs. non popular. So dumb Snapchat.
my snapchat crashes way too much. it is aggravating and it shuts off when i try sending snaps.
You know what’s shocking? Snapchat got horrid feedback with this update almost instantly... and still weeks later we still have it! It’s not like their app is losing users faster than people in North Korea are starving or anything... also the millions of dollars or is it billions at this point including stock prices? Ohh well keep your pride it’s totally worth it Snapchat! We don’t want a roll back or anything like that!
رجعوا السناب القديم ي ملاعين الصلايب
Why the hell yall updated this . It’s ugly . Change it back . NOW
I hate it. It’s awful. I can’t even find my own story.
DO NOT UPDATE
This new update is still awful. I would like the platform to place those I’m voluntarily following back in the same location. I absolutely hate how the super users I follow are bunched together with a bunch of other media platforms I don’t care to follow. Please go back.
Honestly, if you see how bad the reviews of this app have gotten please go back to what it was. Try again
No stars,
y’all trash
The newest update for this app is terrible.
Hate The New Update , It’s Horrible ‼️ Put Snapchat Back How It Was.
If I could give Snapchat a half star I would!!! This is a crappy update!!!
Title says it all. The stories are the number one thing that bothers me about the update. There is no way to find specific stories, and none of my friends stories are in one place. I want to flick through stories like used to be able to. The fonts and actual snapping back and forth is good but as a social media app- it’s now crappy as ever. Instagram and Facebook are now using stories. Nobody can even find mine when I post to snapchat so whats the use.
I used to love Snapchat but this new update has decreased my views and it's horrible. Barely use it now
change it back I’ve already stopped using it
Title says it all-new layout is garbage. Stay Snapchat and don’t try to be IG.
I never write reviews. But this update sent me over the edge. Who at Snapchat thought this was a good idea? I DO NOT want a bunch of f*ing stories from people I hardly ever interact with cluttering up my conversations! NO ONE DOES. What kind of design team scraps a perfectly fine organizational setup in favor of making the homepage of their app a mess? A bad one. Snapchat, please fire whoever thought this was a good idea and revert the update. I'm sick of my conversations page being filled with STUFF THAT ISN'T MY CONVERSATIONS.
I. Do. Not. Like. It. At. All.
I’ve been using Snapchat for YEARS now, and they’ve lost me with this update. It’s a terrible user interface, that makes no sense for new AND returning users. Sad to see the end of this app, but I know something with a nicer interface is bound to take over this platform soon.
Congratulations!  You've invented a new kind of stupid, turned a great app into a terrible one, kind of stupid.  The new update is confusing, cluttered, unconnected, congratulations!  It's hard to find friends, impossible to rewatch stories.   Congratulations! You made an update, that no one wanted, that is to say, you made an app that no one will use.  Congratulations!
The new update is going to take a lot of getting used to
Please change this back to the old one I’m losing all my streaks and the hourglass won’t go away. It’s hard to watch people’s stories I like them in different spots SOOO CHANGE IS BACKKKK PLEASE
First, GO BACK TO THE OLD LAYOUT, IM LITERALLY PHYSICALLY SICKENED BY THE “UPDATE” AND BEYOND DONE WITH IT AT THIS POINT. I (used to) love snap, I use(d) it everyday and I've always just had 10-15 chats open cause I only talk to about that many people on a daily basis, but since this update I have conversations with my ENTIRE FRIENDS LIST, most being people that I rarely and even never talk to, and its literally just there cause they posted on their story and there’s no point in spending 30 minuets or more to clear all the conversations I don’t use cause they just show up again. I even spend 5mins sometimes just to find one of my friends and 20 for my streaks, just cause everything is clustered together and the people that I actually talk to keep getting moved and scattered around randomly for people that posted to their story. Literally ive been resisting the urge to say “here’s my number, call or text me cause im deleting snapchat till they go back to the old layout”. The update has literally given me more anxiety, stress, and anger than anything in my entire life. I don’t even watch my friends stories or stories from pages/people I follow cause it stresses me out trying to find the ones a legitimately want to watch and the way they just go straight into the next persons just adds to the frustration, like i cant find what my friends are doing but it’s nice to know this person in another dimension of time and space enjoys working in a bar? Literally if the next update doesn’t fix the lay out I might actually delete snapchat or strictly use it for streaks. Which is sad for me to say when so much of my life uses snapchat, my work, social life, goals/dream, i use snapchat for all of it and to be this close to saying “I have to delete it or ima have a mental breakdown” is the absolute worst feeling, I know my social life wont be effected much but its a huge step backwards as far as everything else goes. 
I love Snapchat, I've been using it since it's started. This new update y'all have is terrible and super annoying...please just go back to the old update. Everyone I talk to hates the  ew update. Fix the bugs if there were even any, and revert. Sincerely Snapchat user.
Look, we know you're going to put an ad at the end of everybody's story. We get it. That's how you make money. But for the love of everything holy, give us back the timer so we know how many pictures/clips are left. Removing that did not improve the user experience. It’s messy
This treacherous a** update has got to go. Let me rephrase that... this gentrified Bitmoji extension app has got to go back. Snapchat was once a great time filled with everyone’s hourly updates of what they’re doing and their fav filters and now .......... it’s just a Bitmoji app. I don’t see anything else. I can’t even find my own story. I rebuke the Snapchat update in the name of Jesus Christ. I wouldn’t even be that mad if half of my friends didn’t just up and disappear off my page...... don’t even get me started on the organization of this app. Why are  all these people that I haven’t even thought about, let alone snap chatted, in months at the top of my Snapchat app. I need organization. I need a priority list. And my bus buddy from high school is not to be on the top of my priority list. My roommate and a good friend of mine were posting seriously funny stuff on their stories a few nights ago and I had to scroll through valleys and mountains of ignores, read receipts off, basic acquaintances and just flat nuisances just to get to find their stories. I need structure, consistency and a little compassion from the Snapchat team. This type of treatment I’ve gotten the past few weeks is precisely why my last boyfriend got dumped smh. If you don’t know... now you know. Smh.... this is the kind of sh*t that gets you left for the guy she told you not to worry about.
I have used Snapchat basically since it first came out and I’ve loved the app, it’s a great way to communicate, receive information and follow news stories. Sadly, the new update is terrible and I will be deleting the app until a more user friendly, simpler interface is reinstated.
Should have left it the same
I really love this app, but it has a few glitches. It sometimes deletes streaks I have with people even though I know both of us snapped within the time limit. this is a bit frustrating if trying to acquire a long snap streak. but the new update has reformatted all of your snaps/ snap stories and it's TERRIBLE!! And it updated for me automatically even though i don't have that setting turned on. DO NOT UPDATE if you haven't already
I lost a 1,256 day streak due to the new update
This is a garbage update, you screwed up royally, people are actually leaving Snapchat, that’s how bad it has gotten, you need to fix this😂😂😂 I’m actually laughing cause this is 100% ridiculous😭 wow you screwed up.
Wish they would change it back to the old version. Hate the new update.
The new update is 100000% trash. i’m forced to see stories of people i don’t even know, don’t have no interest in, don’t have ADDED, or topics i don’t care about when before i could just ignore or scroll past them.   either change it back or add a “favourite stories list” where we can add people to a little list of whose stories we want to see. similar to twitter lists. 
Guess I won’t be downloading Snapchat
I absolutely hate the new update. It has made so that I can’t just see all my stories at once. The discover page and popular stories are all combined and it’s just messy. It’s basically the explore page of Instagram except the things I’m actually foreclosing are in there too. Snapchat is completely driven by ads now and doesn’t even care about the users. I need Snapchat to communicate with people but now I just hate to use it. CHANGE IT BACK NOW.
It appears that they fired their lead graphic designer and hired an oyster to reformat the app. I’ve basically stopped using snapchat altogether.
Snapchat’s update has ended it’s reign.
😡😡😡
Snapchat use to be very good until the update .... I no longer will use it
The update is yuck 🤢
You know how you used to be able to swipe over and see all your conversations in order of most recent? Well say goodbye to that logic because now it’ll just show you random stuff in an order that makes absolutely no sense in a cluster of nonsense. Why did a conversation that I just sent a message to shoot to the bottom of the list while a conversation that has had nothing happen in it for weeks appear at the top? They didn’t even have anything on their story. It makes no sense. It’s like they figured out how to use random order generation in their coding and were like that seems like a good idea to throw into the app. They’ll love that.  Also pretty much everything in there that they are shoving in your face is clickbait. News flash, I couldn’t care less if Dua copies RiRi nor do I care about how low Demi’s shirt is cut 
What happened? It’s like they had something workable and smooth, then bam all of a sudden “let’s make this kinda confusing and shit”. Rest of Snapchat Team “sounds good”.
Used to really enjoy Snapchat. Now you guys have jumbled up stories so I can find my friends stories anymore and pushing advertisements. It's crap. Uninstalling until you fix it....or don't.
This new update is terrible, I’m losing views on my story and friendships because no one wants to use it with the new update. Please reverse it.
Update trash!
The new update is marginally better but still leaves Snapchat almost unusable for me. You can sort to only see friends stories... but your personal ledger of incoming/outgoing snaps is still muddled in with other things. The discover tab is still a disaster....   If you like following individual celebrities good luck finding the ones you want.... celebrity stories do not show up in your friends section, only the discover tab so you are SOL. Why snap.... why.   RIP SNAP 2010-2018 
Ruined Snapchat for me
Horrible redesign and poor decision making by execs. Stubbornness can kill sometimes.   Maybe the CEO can write a How To book about throwing a company in the toilet. 
Please change this back. If I could rate the update 0 stars I would. This is absurd. You’re loosing money and users. No one is getting used to this; you should really have a way to revert the update because everybody would. I’m unhappy and angry and I speak for many as I complain about this trash update.
So this update brings ads basically, and you take away our best friends? No. Give us our best friends back!   And as for the updates probably trying to renew you reviews. Not gonna work. I'll rate 1 star every time you update until you give us what we really want.   Update: You no longer let us use 3rd party apps because why? You guys are sellouts and your new discover feature is just a quick buck. Horrible app, horrible company. Listen to the people who use your app, and give us what we want.  Update: Get your stupid app out of politics. This was suppose to be a fun, community friendly app, and now it's trying to be a biased new source. Seriously? I can't wait for another app to come along and replace this piece of crap.  Update: Get your stupid discover feature out of my stories page. I don't want to view your stupid adverts.  Update: Paid replays? Really? Are you serious? What a stupid, horrible application this is. I remember when snapchat was fun. Now it's just a sellout of an app.  Update: Lens Store? Wow. I really hate you all as a company. Horrible developers, and a horrible app.  Update: You're seriously going to put ads between stories. I promise I'll never stop rating 1 star. Worst. App. Developers. Ever.   - Lens Store shut down. Ha. Ha. Ha. Good riddance. Still leaving that update there though. 
Hate the auto advance story, can't tell who's is who's. I want to click one and then see one story at a time. Change it back to the way it used to be. Newest update it trash so unorganized unpleasant aesthetic I hate it so much and I don't know one person who doesn't.
Nice attempt i guess
Update is trash
I hate you
I wasn’t a regular snapper but I do enjoy looking at some of the friends snaps. I guess now you have to regularly exchange in private snaps to see friends stories. If there’s another way I can’t figure it out but I barely use this now. The layout is too much I’m seeing waaaay to many things that I don’t care about.
La actualización de la aplicación es mi muy mala
I, like many others do not like the new update! Put it back the old way please. I am even thinking of deleting it!
Ever since the update earlier this month I can’t hardly stand to use the app. Went from 4 stars to 1 star
Go back to old Snapchat
I used love using this, and I’ve even tried to get used to the new update but it is absolutely horrible. I don’t even care to use it anymore smh!!
This new update is suckie
The update is actually bad in general. The changes were unnecessary to an already near perfect format. 👎
I got to hate my gf cause of this new update...
I hate the update change it back no one likes it. Everyone’s using different social media apps so good job :)
Snapchat is literally one of my favorite apps, I believe that I could be made better by allowing users to change their username. Even if it had a limit to how many times you could change it.
I’m not liking the new update at all besides the new bitmoji feature & gifs.
I used to love getting on Snapchat, now this the update is here i hate it. The snaps are all out of order and random! I don’t know when someone post! PLEASE GET SNAPCHAT BACK to how it was!
I hate this new update!! Snapchat was the only social media app I used and now I don’t use it because of the new update. Everything is all over the place and I see the same stories everyday. Just because I chat with certain people doesn’t mean I want to watch only their stories.  Change it back to the old Snapchat. I liked the set up of Snapchat about 2 years ago when you could tell how long a snap was. Now Snapchat is doing too much and trying to be like other social media apps. I liked them because they were different. But now it’s just another average app
It is clear via the ratings that Snapchat doesn’t care about us or our issues. We do not like this update. Instead of listening to us we are being forced to update to something new. Instead of changing it back, they try to make it easier. It’s not that much easier. Please just change it back. You saying no to us is basically putting the shareholders and advertisers before us. Instagram wouldn’t do that 🙃
Recent update IS TRASH. BRING THE OLD SNAPCHAT BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don’t like the update , I will delete my account because of this update.
Tired of this app. I loved it and the convenience to create contacts with new people but the update is very frustrating to use. I tried getting used to it but it’s annoying and not user friendly anymore. I also hate that I get constant advertisements for Chappy. I get them all the time and I like women! Deleted.
This new update removes the ability to swipe to chat. At first I was fine with the new update but now I absolutely hate it. C’mon stop making this app harder to use and just make it simple and quick.
The app should have never been tampered with on this level. Instead of giving us an ugly format, GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT. Go back to the old format and allow us to change our usernames and not just our display names.
Have you not noticed that snap only has 1.8 stars? That doesn’t concern you guys??? Maybe you should start thinking about your app users opinions.
This was a good app, until the last update...now it’s completely garbage.
If you update, you are forced to see a news feed of random celebrities that you don’t care about. The articles are harder to find, which is daunting to some; friend stories become scattered and mixed in with your messages and it’s just a mess. A change this big is not meant to feel like an off-brand snapchat.
Horrible gonna delete
Change it back
Bring the old snap chat!!! This new update is horrible. No one will get used to it. Snap chat will just slowly die if you don't change back.
This isn’t news but it seems every update makes this fun app go downhill. If it wasn’t bad enough that they changed the entire look and story page of the app, it now keeps freezing up on me after there was another “update”. Please stop. If it’s not broken, don’t fix it.
LISTEN TO YOUR USERS FOR ONCE! you lost so much money from this update & you still won’t change it back. CHANGE IT BACK.
i wouldn’t recommend snapchat to anyone anymore because of this new update it’s terrible
Thank you guys for listening to the users and reverting to something similar to the old interface.
New update stay away not a great update Snapchat needs to make a commercial or ad tab for all the stupid advertising that pops up now. I’m missing out on my actual friends I wanna see on my page I care about how to bake a pie.  You guys need to update again and remove these ads to a separate tab for when I really wanna look for something else.
1. Mixing your messages and stories. Horrible idea. It ruffles my feathers, because nothing on in order.   2. “Popular stories” 😡  A. I hate the Kardashian’s and DO NOT like to see them on my feed.  B. Makes following celebrities/ and youtubers so, impersonal. I feel like they’re my friends when I see their stories pop up. And now it just reminds me that Ima no body...   3. MOST IMPORTANTLY - I’m one for updates and changes in Apps, I don’t kind FB and IG completely changing every couple of years. But this is so unorganized. It took me two days to figure out where my friends list was. And how to view their stories. I love snap chat because it’s so personal. At least it is for me. With under 30  friends who follow me, i feel like it’s about what I’m doing now. Not about a TBT or a MCM. It’s about the last 24hrs. Please organize the new update.   4. HOW TO FIX THIS  A. Separate messages and stories  B. Let the celebs that we follow back on our regular story lines.  C. Keep the new popular page layout. I like that.  B. I DONT WANT TO FOLLOW / see other celebrities just because they have SC. If I want to follow them. I will.  C. Make it easier to click on peoples stories. It’s annoying  to accidentally hit their name and go to messages 80% of the time. 
The update isn’t terrible overall, it will just take a while to get used to. But the discover page is full of pages that I don’t subscribe to/don’t want to see. Why is there an option to “see less like this” if more other pages just pop up in their place?
the new update is trash. fix it.
This update is trash. Please change it back im about to delete snapchat. This new part of the new update is even worse!! I really hate it
This last update you did in February 2018 is the absolute worst thing you’ve ever done to this app. I refuse to use it anymore until it goes back. I don’t want to have to switch between my friends and celebrities to see snaps. And I can’t tell if I’m checking someone’s story or sending them a message. Absolute 💩💩💩
Snapchat's interface was seamless before the update. I gave myself some time to get used to it before I jumped to conclusions. I still haven't adapted to the new layout. It feels cluttered, inaccessible, and gimmicky. Before, I had more control over what I could and could not see. Now, "celebrities" and product promoters saturate the explore page. Stories play back-to-back in no particular order, and the people who I actually Snapchat are buried under irrelevant media. I have given up viewing stories, and my daily interactions with the app have greatly diminished. Ultimately, by trying to force users to consume more media, the update has only decreased screen time. I understand why the team is standing firm with the changes. They knew that eventually, the controversy would die down. Yes, they can absolutely ignore public outcry. But, their product will remain virtually unusable.
It’s very annoying to have all of my friends on one page. Yesterday I went and deleted some conversations from my chat list because it was too crowded and didn’t want them to show up. Thinking that i could deal with just looking them up to see friends’ stories, I went ahead and only kept the ones I chat with the most (send snaps, etc). Within an hour, everyone’s chat came back. Idk if it’s because they added stories. What the whole point of deleting conversations from the chat if they’re coming back in an hour!
Snapchat, I have tried. I have tried to give you a chance and get use to this update. I have tried to lean more about the app and how to be a better user. However, alas, I can really do no more. I know you are proud of your product and I know how great Snapchat can be, but this is not it. I find it noble that you are sticking to your guns on this new update but it’s okay to admit that you where wrong and you can be better, and I am sure users will appreciate it. I know you can do better, be better, and still be innovative but may it is just a different look that what it is at now.   Best 
It was good, till they decided to mess up the format...I miss the old way
I updated it & the new fonts don’t show up 😒😒😒
Update is trash. Instagram stories is better. Y’all really messed up lol. Bye y’all 😊
Very confused as to why snapchat hasn’t changed their update yet. This new update is absolutely unorganized and quite confusing. Tried getting used to it and it hasn’t happened yet. Looking at all of the other reviews it seems obvious that the people actually using the app do not like it, Snapchat...Get it together and listen to the people who are using your app! WE HATE IT!
Very bad and agile
I love the app so much but I hate the update.
I used to actually like Snapchat and would use it daily. I think the bitmoji's are great. I absolutely hate the update and I now don't even use the app. I probably won't use the app until Snapchat changes it back, if they even will. I have random peoples story's on my story side of Snapchat and on my chat side I have people that I don't even talk to everywhere and if I am texting someone their name gets moved if someone else posts on their story. I am really disappointed in Snapchat and hope that they bring back the old Snapchat.
There should be a button that you hit to send to all your streaks!
Snapchat is a prime example of doing way too much and ruining a GREAT thing. If you miss the old, fun way of doing things just stick with Instagram and IG stories, that way you won’t have to bounce to another app just to be frustrated over this user-unfriendly option and tedious, confusing features that nobody really needs. I’ve already moved my whole audience to Instagram, we’ll be there until things get better. 👎🏻
UPDATE THIS FREAKING APP!!!
Update is trash
Still hate the update 💩
I don’t understand how you don’t care about your customers opinion. You’ve only made the app worse with the tabs I cant.
Bring back the old Snapchat!
Is update is horrible!😣💔
The update is terrible . They messed up Snapchat trying to be different we were perfectly fine with how it was ... please change it back !!!!!!!
Still waiting for you guys to bring he old one back or I’m deleting this
Used to use Snapchat all the time. New update is terrible. Hardly use it anymore. Shame.
I used to really enjoy Snapchat, but here lately the changes have really left me missing the previous format. The subscriptions I used to read are missing and now there are so many stories I can’t find anything. While I understand change is good, this latest one is not for the better. 😕
take away your stupid update, thank ya :)
I used snapchat all the time before this big redesign. Now everything is hard to use and I absolutely hate the fact that my stories are where the chats are, and my friends are out of order. I can’t watch stories like I used to because I get annoyed having to continue clicking. I see an eventual end of use with this app if it doesn’t go back to the way it was before. Why dramatically change the app when it was working just fine?
I’m logging into my Snapchat so that I can get all my pics out. But unless this update is reversed I’m gonna have to delete my snap. It’s too cluttered and just ugh. It irritates me. I haven’t met a single person pleased with this update.
this new update is just absolutely terrible. It's too confusing, too many things everywhere. LESS IS MORE! Combining both the message and story feed into one section was terrible. @Snapchat please just switch back. When Instagram switched to the new look, it was just the color theme really that changed while you guys actually changed the function of the application. That's something people won't get used to and slowly you guys, snapchat, will die into one of those unpopular social medias....
New update after the major update didnt change anything. Ive finally gone ahead and deleted this crap.   Sorry not sorry. 
Still no better!! Why is it such a problem to change it back to the way it was before?? Why does it have to be so different?! HATE THIS APP and the UNNECESSARY CHANGES YOU'RE MAKING!
I use Snapchat everyday to talk to friends and now the updates is making it VERY difficult to do so. #bringbacktheoldsnap
la nueva actualización no me gusta boy a borrar les recomiendo no bajar esta app es orrible
With this so called ‘new update’ and the new fonts...yeah they aren’t there. I’ve even un-installed and re-installed and it still doesn’t work.
I LOVE THE NEW UPDATE! 💕💕 I love all the new text you can use! I don't really use the discover so that don't affect me. And I love how the stories are now and you can just watch all of them back to back. I feel like everyone is just mad because they don't like change. I love it and I hope it stays!
Snapchat y’all knew better this update is not what’s up line really? I’m about to delete the whole app
I can’t even open the Snapchat app itself anymore. You guys need to get your sh*t together
Snapchat app keeps updating and not even paying attention to all the requests we keep asking for! I can not stand how everything is in my messages then on top of that nobody’s posts are in order (by time). Its jus all over the place ! I like the OLD SNAPCHAT set up. This here is a mess and needs to get tossed out the window!!!! Horrible horrible horrible ! Bring back the old snap chat the timeline that actually made sense!!! This here is GARBAGE AND NOONE LIKES IT ! PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR REVIEWS.
i wouldn’t mind the update as much if the stories were on a separate page
If I could give no stars I would , they completely ruined snap with this last update and do they care? Heck no , they are being ignorant with it and saying “well they’ll just have to learn ti like it” BS. Look at the reviews look at the rating they could give two craps about us. Greedy ignorant people that’s all they are
The old version was better 🤷🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Everyone clearly hates the new update. Do the right thing and change it back. Whoever signed off on this should be fired
🚮🚮🚮🚮
Snapchat is TRAAAAAAAASH. All because the new update is hella TRAAAAAAASH. Glad it has 1.8 Star on ratings overall.
Please go back to the old format. New format is crap. A giant clusterfuck. 
The only way I can see if someone opened my snap or how long ago they opened it is if I watch their story. It tells me how long ago they posted their story but I don’t want to watch it I want to see how long ago it was seen or delivered. Also I can’t go onto the chat option with someone unless I open their snap first. If I slide right then all I do is change it to the stories section.
This new update is horrific, i used to use Snapchat every minute of everyday now with this update I’m not even tempted to sign in. It’s horrible. I can’t keep up with my conversations, i can’t even watch the people i want to watch snap without typing their name in which is quite absurd, i don’t know if people opened my message unless i watch their whole entire story which is also annoying, this update makes it really hard for me. Especially for someone who has been using Snapchat for years now. It’s not that it’s new, it’s because it’s confusing and unconventional. AND THE WORST PART IS NOW I WENT FROM 500+ views to like 60 !!!
It got way more complicated and not as easy to use
How they heck am I supposed to open group chat messages without watching the snap it’s self???? The swiping doesn’t work!!
Change is always great but it hard when you can enjoy it. My Snapchat crashes when taking a picture. That’s wack.
So I updated my Snapchat recently and I haven’t got the new fonts for the text yet! I’m very disappointed because all of my friends have it and I don’t.
Ever since the update happened I’m not able to get into Snapchat at all , I’ve had snapchat for a almost 4 years now and i can’t get into the app at all when I press on the app the app just closes out and it goes badly to my home screen please do something about this so I can continue using what used to be my favorite app.
Absolutely horrible.
Bring back the old version
The new update is horrible to use! It’s confusing and doesn’t feel intuitive at all. I’m a person who deletes the conversations every night, and like a clear, clean message page where it’s only a couple friends I’ve recently messaged. This stupid update keeps on bringing up friends I haven’t messaged on here for months! Completely annoying to delete a convo every single time someone updates their story. And on top of that it isn’t organized! I haven’t figured out how they place them, but it’s not alphabetized or most recently messaged. There’s been several times I’ve gotten a snap, opened it, double tapped on the top convo (thinking it’s the person who just messaged me) and it ends up being someone who added to their story and the wrong person!!!! (AFTER I SENT IT!) Please make the app back to what it used to be Snapchat!! Until then I’ll continue to have notifications turned off and not using the app, because this is just ridiculous.
I don’t even care to log on anymore because finding my friends stories is just more complicated and not in chronological order and I have to scroll and see unnecessary verified stories from people I don’t even follow or care about. Snapchat.... wyd 🤦‍♂️
The new update ruined snapchat for many.  I do not have much of a desire to snapchat people as much as I used to.  The stories being on the same page as snapchats is very annoying.  It is also annoying how when you are clicking through a snapchat and the person also has a story you can click through that too.  Not impressed with the new update and by the looks of the reviews neither are they.
Soo bad
Well first of all Snapchat has came up with a solution for the latest update everyone was freaking out about.. I have the newest version and when you swipe left it is divided into 3 options one is group the other is stories and then all.. so bare with them guys.. prayers are answered
can we just back to the old version because my story and friends story come inside together in the chat
Snapchat is a great app and I use it everyday for various group chats and just snapping in general. I enjoy the subscriptions like ESPN, Daily Mail. Snapchat used to be a 5 star app in the App Store but this new update that combines the stories page and messages page is very confusing and me as well as many other of my peers and have deleted the app because of this. I do not like seeing someone at the top of my list that I haven’t spoke to in 2 years and then having to scroll and find group chats used daily. Please just improve on the previous system as y’all always do and go back to the other update.  Thanks. 
My Snapchat updated automatically. It is by far the worst update- all your: 1. Stories  2. Snaps 3. Chats  4. Recents  5. Stapstreaks 6. Bitmojis  Are all on the same page.  You can barley tell when someone posted a story The entire page is clustered  The other page are public stories that you follow PLUS random people that you don’t even follow MIXED with all other pages like mashable, tastemade, IGN, daily mail etc.  DO NOT download Snapchat - it is the most confusing app. I used to use it 24/7 and now I barley use it and people barley watch yours story 
After the new format update snapchat forces the ads in between your friends stories. This app has gone downhill. I used to keep up on story's regularly but the new layout has made me lose any desire of even opening the app. Reverse it please. No one likes it.
You should really remove the update.
I love Snapchat I use It everyday, there’s not a day I don’t use It but with the new update I feel like I get less views and I use the app less. They change the filters every other day
I don’t like seeing the stories with my messages. And on top of that, I have to scroll and scroll and scroll AND SCROLL just to find someone I messaged a few hours ago. I really don’t like the new version and it’s hard to get used to.
I use Snapchat everyday so I’d say I’m a Snapchat connoisseur. But this new update is annoying. I don’t like it one bit and it’s only made it more difficult to use the app. I can’t go to one place to watch someone’s story I have to scroll to find it. Then all of the snapchats I just sent are in some funky order because of people posting their stories. Also the discovery tab I can’t just watch the stories I want to watch of the places I subscribed to I have to scroll and find them. I’m very upset with this new update.
Snapchat is the most idiotic app at the moment. It’s like they don’t pay attention to anyone. The whole world is complaining about the update and they still refuse to change it. I would not recommend this app to anyone until they change it back. No one even views my stories hardly anymore. Why fix something that isn’t broken?
What.... in the.... actual.... fudge bro??? So unorganized that I keep sending people the wrong snap. I think my mom has seen my 2cm willy more than I like 😐
Fix the UI/UX.   Curate content more.   Look at it from the user’s perspective. It seems youre too heavily focused on your target demo—too much tunnel vision thatyou’ll lose everyone else around you. We’re all heading towards instagram 
All we need now is to be able to change username and discover should be where everyone stories are not where the message they should be allowed to add celebrities and News discovery to there SC
i use to LOVE snapchat but ever since this “new” update i can’t stand to even open the app
Snapchat went from simple and clean to complicated, messy, and confusing.
Try developing better filters..this format is awful
After the recent update layout change I’ve really started to hate snapchat. It’s completely obvious that they are making these changes purely to make more money and has absolutely nothing to do with the users experience. It has made seeing your FRIENDS stories very difficult to find but seeing the PAID advertisement stories is easier than ever.  STOP SCREWING OVER THE USERS JUST TO MAKE MORE MONEY 🖕 
I dont know why they wont change it back to the old format. I deleted the app off my phone and Im not going to download it again. They can keep. I might just make an Instagram again.
Were you guys supposed to change it back because you didn’t and no one likes the person who changed it so can you pleas change it back
Snapchat weak now I don't even open it anymore
the new update is horrible please change back to the old one PLEASE!!!!
I am so upset with this new update that it is NOT even funny. It is so bad to the point that i dont even use this app like i used to anymore. Everything is just mashed up together and i just don’t understand what is going on anymore. I just wish you guys would fix it back to the way it used to be.
The new layout is terrible and that seems to be the consensus with the majority of users. Revert back to the old layout before you lose this user and others.
It’s hard to watch stories after you watch them once it’s hard to go back and watch them again I hate this new update it’s stupid makes everything cluttered go back to the old Snapchat and I really hate the Discover stories I have stores I want to look at and after I look at them it’s so cluttered you can Not go back to them this is stupid
The new Snapchat layout is awful and they tried to clutter everything to make it better when it just made it worse
I hate the update. I want the old sc back
Snapchat ruined their app. That’s on them. Someone make a new app with all the old features and then we can all just switch to that. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it. If only the Snapchat creators understood this. I don’t get why they can’t just switch it back. But hey I’m just a user of the app speaking for every person that uses it. I thought in business you worked off supply and demand. There’s no demand for the new update. There’s a demand for the old. If they can’t supply they don’t deserve to run app.
New update kinda gay lol
Please go back to the original one!
App is all jumbled. It crashes. & I don’t like how my conversations are all mixed together with non conversations. & that I can’t look at all my stories in one page anymore. & I don’t like how all of these suggested pages have popped up. Not interested.
Don’t update snapchat the new update is garbage. Very disappointed
Change back SNAPCHAT!!
It’s not even a matter of “it will just take some getting used to”!!!!!  It is not user friendly at ALL!  It doesn’t flow well and you can’t just see new snaps without having to scroll down through all your friends.  I don’t want to have to be searching and scrolling to find my friends stories or even the popular stories of celebs.  It’s just awful and not even worth the effort!!!  Didn’t even want to give this one star but had to just to be able to write a review!!!!!
Thanks for ruining snap chat
Omg stop trying to change it in some way.Making the snap organized into groups ,stories and snaps is still so cluttered!!Just changes back to the way it was or at least make the option for the ppl who don’t want the update to get the old one back!!
I used to use Snapchat every day but the update made it incredibly difficult to use. I had to delete the app because how difficult the update made it to use. It’s unfortunate because I love the concept of Snapchat and loved using it but the update makes it nearly impossible.
Hate the new update. Might as well email each other since that's easier than snapping someone with the new update.
It looks cluttered and a little chaotic. I think the list is better and more organized and it’s easier to choose who’s story I want to see.
Everything about this app is crap now. Why don't you listen to what EVERYONE is saying and fix it.
It’s a terrible update
What did you do?? Why?? Who did you ask if this was a good idea? Did you even ask any of your users if they like the changes? The most recent update is terrible. The personal msgs are a welcome change but the content feed is so bad and filled with mostly trash. 
Worse update/changeover ever. It went from a free fun app that allowed you to easily snap friends and family and tailored your homepage all about you.  Now it’s all paid ads, hence the discover/discovery page. Stuck up jerks I deleted and won’t ever use it again. 
This new update is horrible, I wish I could watch the stories like I used to be able to. I don’t think I’m the only one who feels like this as well....
Not even gonna say anything cause everyone else said what have to say
Please Change Update Back It Is Horrible I Don’t Even Use It Like That Anymore I’m Not The Only One
So the craziest thing about the people in charge of this app is that we have spoken out about how we REALLY dislike their completely new update. There was a petition with more than a million signatures and multiple celebrities and people across the world expressing their disappointment in this new update, & yet snap chat creators do not care. Not everything about the update is terrible but the navigation and how it’s organized can be a bit confusing and just annoying for the most part. The users are one of the reasons the snapchat app is so great and popular and the creators decided to ignore us users and to me it seems like complete disrespect to the people who have supported the snap chat movement. Instagram will be my favorite for now since snap chat can careless about its users. 🤷🏽‍♀️
The new Snapchat update isn’t so great, it’s confusing, complicated to use and go around on. Please give us back the old format version of Snapchat, it’s way better and easier to use.
Snap used to be my number 1 app. The ugly new update made me delete it. It’s cluttered, stressful, irritating, and aesthetically repulsive. I won’t even think redownloading until this is fixed >:(
change the update back like you said you would on twitter! why you false claiming being a big social media app i would think you would stick to what you said about your 50,000 reposts when you got way more. lies, lies, lies
Honestly if I could drop the rating to a 0.5 I would I only open the app for a filter and then take my picture to Instagram
I used to use snap religiouslly but now I’m So frustrated by this update I want to delete it because the update is SO ugly
Snapchat was updated a little since everyone freaked out, but I still miss the old snap. It was way easier to navigate and a lot more organized. Consider switching back to something like that again
There is nothing but liberal ideology and propaganda pushed on this app. This is not a place for ideas to coexist.
Snapchat used to be my favorite app. I used it all the time and it was the best way to contact me. I loved it. The other day though the company updated it to a whole new version and it’s horrible. Nothing is the same way and I’m open to change but this update has made more problems than solutions. Snapchat has made several updates since and each one is just adding to the pile of disgust. I want the old Snapchat back. Everyone I’ve talked with wants the old one back. Why has Snapchat not listened to its consumers?
You NEED to put people's story's separately from the personally sent snaps. This is so confusing. I look at someone's story then it goes away and I can't even tell who's story I was just looking at. You guys made it so confusing and it's frustrating to the point where I'm just gonna delete the app. There was nothing wrong with the old Snapchat. Please don't try to fix things that aren't broken.
WHAT WERE YOU GUYS THINKING
This app is so ugly now
I used to have multiple group chats and would talk to people all he time on Snapchat. Now since the update, most of my group chats have died out, and I simply don’t have conversations using the app. Since it prioritizes snaps you have received and people with stories, it’s very difficult to find conversations young have been having with someone. It also makes it very difficult to snap only certain people as it brings up the people that you may have been ignoring. It’s also very cluttered and not as clean. You guys should have actually given people the option to update instead of ruining the app for all people who had it.
This update makes it painfully difficult to socialize with people you actually know or what to see. I don't care about the famous people. And having my friends and DMs in the same screen is just a terrible idea. IG did a similar algorithm and we've been complaining since. The focus has to be on the consumer and the businesses, not just famous people and ads.
The update is bad
Soooo just because your rich and you know people will still use your app, you refuse to change it back? We still absolutely hate it by the way and I don’t know why you imbeciles can’t do something as simple as CHANGING IT BACK!!! God you’re all dense.
this update is too much. Everything is all on top of everything else. it's to cluttered i tried to get use to BUT i can't.
The new update drastically changed my interface with the app. I do not enjoy nor do I understand how to use the new update. How is one to find a particular story? Why when i scroll through each story they pop back up? Please fix this
I had lost my streak after 500 days, but I texted their support team about the problem I had and fixed it in a matter of 15min. Best customer service I have ever had.
The update is almost worse than Trump becoming "president"
This update was awful, I am not not sending any snaps to the right people. I double click on one name but the snap sends to someone else. This update was really unnecessary, why take something good and ruin it, the way it was, was completely fine
love the app not the update
i have been using snapchat since it first came out and this new update makes me wanna throw up.  i hate that the stories are with the chats i just don’t like it
The ridiculous format and the fact that there are BDSM and other wildly inappropriate ads viewable by minors. Fix it.
Absolutely hate the update, completely unacceptable, can not function with it and really confusing!
Like I never would have thought a day in my life that I would hate Snapchat. My views went down because it is harder for people to find my story due to the fact the only people story the pop up or people that are famous or your recents and it’s so easy to accidentally open messages I am completely dissatisfied and utterly stuck between quitting Snapchat or seeing if it will get better 😪
Ever since the new update a few weeks ago, I can’t see my friends’ stories if I log out of Snapchat. For example, I don’t like to get on social media first thing in the morning, so at night before bed I log out of Snapchat. The next morning when I log back into Snapchat once I get to work, all of my friends’ stories are gone; it’s not showing that they have a story. The app only started doing this when Snapchat made the update to show stories & individual conversations on the same page when you swipe to the right. Just because I log out doesn’t mean that I don’t want to see stories when I log back in. I should still be able to see the stories that were added before AND while I was logged out.
Getting to your friends stories is cumbersome. I don’t care about the other crap.
change snapchat back to normal!!! i don’t want to see random you tubers and “popular stories” otherwise i would add those people....
Snap chat will never be the same I’m not updating anything I don’t use it and it is not worth it anymore since that stupid update
The update is awful. I don’t care about the discover page and seeing celebrities or ads or news. The purpose is to keep in touch with friends and add to your story throughout the day. This app update makes no sense. Bring back the old snap chat.
I hate this new update in all honesty. I used to get so many views on my stories and thats something thats beneficial when you try and promote your music on snapchat. Now I get around half as many views and if I do have a time in which the majority of people see it, its after the time is almost expired and I have to repost again, hence the process begins again. The new update just take so much away from the simplicity of how it was before. It would be nice if snapchat could actually understand the people who use the app, rather than just be stubborn and just do what they want to do. I love snapchat I really do, but the rating have just gone downhill.
Where to even begin... it auto forced my update after about a week of me not updating it because of all the complaints I heard. Now I see why people are upset. It's terrible you can't navigate the app anymore they merged story's with people you snap but they removed the relevance. So now someone you just snapped could be a the way at the bottom of your list. I don't know why they did this but it needs to change. Thank you to everyone for giving your honest reviews and bringing this app from a 5 star to a 2 star. It deserves 1 for this new update. They had a perfect platform that they got us all comfortable with and we all enjoyed and now they've stripped it from us. I used to use the app all the time now I barely touch it and am probably going to delete it
You should have an unlimited amount of people able to be in a group chat
I can’t find any of my friends story y’all I see is ads . Yaw should put the ads and random stories back on their own page and leave the popular stories mixed in with our friends . But put the others back on its own page . Or allow of too pick what type of ad posts we would like too see . (Ad post) are the ones like bleacher report , nbc , abc those ones .It would really make a big difference
I loveeeee Snapchat , but ever since they change the format I’ve been loosing streaks and I can’t even open them and I have to search for them. I can’t watch people stories , and I’ve also been loosing a lot of views too . I was thinking about deleting my Snapchat until they got the old format back, and I will delete it until the old format . Nobody likes it at all . I rather go back to KIK because this new format is uglyyy and I don’t like . I never have a problem but I’m rating them a one star til they change their format back to its original one .
So I love Snapchat, or use it most of the time. But the recent update is terrible, I’m not sure anyone really likes it and I’m not sure why you guys don’t go back to the old one..
The new update made it so much more complicated then it should be. It is terrible. Do not get his app.
Whoever is responsible for the demise of Snapchat should be publicly identified
Obviously the creators of snapchat haven’t gotten how everyone is unhappy from the update, it’s very confusing and doesn’t make any sense as to why they still have not updated back to the old update, I don’t use Snapchat as half as much as I used too. Disappointed and I hope snapchat creators read our reviews
this new update is tragic
Snapchat went from the best app ever to probably the most useless app on my phone.
I love Snapchat but hate the new update. It’s really bad and disorganized. Kinda dread using it now. I mean to send a snap to one person and it ends up going to another. Please do something.
every time I use the app it glitches and the screen goes black and shuts out the app
Why is this app complicated now?  As crazy and hectic as our lives are, the former layout was easy and quick to utilize. Changing the old format to this recent update is making it difficult to comprehend. No one knows what’s going on and how it works. Suggesting whose snaps I should watch or follow is aggressive and pushy. Who ever the light bright of the group was that thought this was a good idea, I have a question for you, ARE YOU DUMB?! *majahype voice* Please change it back for the sake of humanity. Thanks in advance!
It keeps telling me i need to update it to get the fonts even if i keep updating it, it just wont update and would tell me it needs updating!
1/5 Not taken into consideration that not many people like the latest update. I never pushed it through on my phone but it was still somehow went. Glad to see that I’m not the only person who dislikes it though. 
I would rate this 5 stars but i can’t. I’ve been with this app since it came out and never experienced crashing multiple times to where i can’t even get on it without it crashing. Can you guys please fix this?
This new update is garbage please change it back to how it was before this update ASAP
Make stories the way they used to be
My Snapchat keeps saying I need camera access when it is already available. Fix the bugs.
it was fun I mean like BEFORE the update. THE UPDATE ruind in I’m moving to Instagram they said they are adding streaks
the update is to confusing and weird all my friends want the old snapchat back...
THE NEW UPDATE IS NOT GOOOD !!!! NO ONE LIKES IT !! IT MESSING MY WHOLE SNAPCHAT UP CAN YOU PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK TO HOW IT WAS!!! PLEASE !! BRING THE OLD SNAPCHAT UPDATE BACK ✊🏾 THIS NEW UPDATE WAS NOT I REPEAT NOT A GOOD IDEA SO BRING THE OLD SNAPCHAT BACK PLEAEEEEE
Refer to the title ..
Absolutely horrible update that was done out of pure greed and design ignorance. What a sad world we live in. I can’t even look at a list of my friends in abc order, Snapchat feels uncomfortable to use anymore. Snapchat knee their update was horrible and was prepared to take a loss. But hey, Snapchats C.E.O. just made the biggest bonus check in history; so obviously they don’t care
the new update is totally trash pls fix it
Y’alls ratings definitely went down.. this update is literally trash! My stories should be on one side and my messages on the other 😑😤
Ever since the re-update my Snapchat crashes without letting me on it every time I go on the app.
This new update is making me lose alas of my streaks‼️‼️
Been away from snapchat for a little while, came back to the new update...it’s really awful. If it’s not broken, don’t fix it. Not a fan at all and will be limiting my usage.
This new update is absolute garbage. PLEASE change it back. I used to be addicted to Snapchat but now I absolutely hate it.
I just delete I it's so bad
After the update this app turned into one of the worst apps on my phone extremely hard to use, find friends stories, streaks and recents, and I still haven’t found my own stories.😡😡
I loved snapchat before the update , now it’s trash.... deleting😀
i still hate this stupid update and i haven’t gotten used to i.t and i’m actually just about ready to delete snap.
Literally always a good app but since this update it crashes every time I try taking a picture and it’s really annoying. I deleted and reinstalled & even restarted my phone. Fix this ASAP please.
Ads are sh*t
NiBBa whomst made this update has the smallest penis
Every time I take a snap or video my app crashes. What do I do?
We need the old one
Don’t get me wrong, Snapchat is a great app. But, ever since the new update, everyone has been debating if we all should delete it or not. The new update should be deleted and changed back into the previous version
What happened to yall changing it back on February 20th??? We still waiting for the change because the new snap got to go. I have lost multiple streaks because of it.
This app keeps getting worse in my opinion.  Why are my chats with the new stories? I have no interest in discovery. Why does it have its entire space? Definitely your worse idea so far 
I understand y’all wanted to create more revenue by making us watch stupid stories no one cares about, but in the long run y’all losing more money lol. Also have fun with the 1.3 billion y’all lost cause Kylie trashed y’all in the news.
CHANGE IT BACK
This update has made me thoroughly dislike the app and I now hardly use it anymore. The layout before was very efficient and I loved it. However, now the app is obnoxious. By placing snap chatters that I never talk to who update their stories at the top of my conversation list, it is difficult to keep my streaks and friends in order. This update is awful and a reverse is needed.
اشخاص ماعرفهم يطلعو لي  و استهلاك غير طبيعي للبطارية و البيانات  تعليق  و لخبطة في قصص الاصدقاء و الدردشات 
They want more money by putting more advertising in it. Uninstall and go to another application. They forced a redesign so users will have to watch stupid commercials of products I will NEVER use. Snapchat is NOT paying my bills, so don’t be forced to pay theirs.
New update ruined the app. Will delete
I’m switching to Instagram
The new update is really confusing and unnecessary and 4 of my snap streaks just deleted for no reason and I’m not going to submit every single one to snapchat support because that would take forever. They showed timers on all of them even though we both had sent things to each other. Please fix it.
Too cluttered. The DM screen and the story screen should be separated. It’s hard to see who has a new story and who doesn’t. I DO NOT LIKE THE “DISCOVER” section. If you’re going to keep that at least make it my “favorites” or the stories of people I normally watch. I can barely find out how to watch my own story now. Or see who has viewed it. I will be deleting now as it’s just too complicated and all over the place.
I have use Snapchat since day one this new update is not working I can’t look at my friends stories like I want to I have a hard time finding people it’s getting really annoying if it don’t get fix I’m just going to uninstall and just go back to Facebook and Instagram
Wet sloppy farts
Almost a month into this new cluttered update and no it’s not something to get used to. This update makes me not even want to open the app anymore and it makes me open other apps I be forgetting about when the old version of Snapchat was here. Snapchat went from going to 3 or 4 stars to 1 star. Listen to the fans who use to love this app and do better.
This update is awesome. I get to see more of the things I liked about Snapchat. I am able to watch snaps of people from around the world. This update is innovating and great.
WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT AND SUE SNAPCHAT AND SIGN 90 MORE PETITIONS TO GET THE OLD UPDATE BACK
I used to enjoy looking at my friends stories on snap chat because the app was simple but effective. With the addition of the discover page and all the articles, I was disappointed then, but the whole purpose of snap chat remained. With this new update I feel that you no longer please your customer. I will now be permanently deleting snap chat and will stick to Instagram stories as it is much easier to use than this garbage of an app.
Can’t find stories. It’s completely different than it was. Not the app I was told was so cool. Now it’s just annoying. I’ll download it again if I hear the “improvements” have been fixed, i.e. eliminated.
this latest update has lost me. I no longer watch people's stories due to the structure. I hate this new update so much I don't even get on the app more than once a day and I even lost a ton of steaks due to my lack of interest and others aswell. Change back!!! your stockholders can still be happy if y'all do!!!
This is the worst update ever. I thought it was reversing back b4 the update yesterday!!! Wat happened
Why tf’ do we have to individually delete each conversation?! that’s the most annoying update other than the others.
The newest update is garbage. I don’t want to discover random celebrities snap stories. I want all of my friends stories. I don’t want to have to scroll thru my chat logs to see who has posted to their story. And I don’t want to send group snaps by accident. CHANGE. IT. BACK. UGHHHHH. 😡😡😡
Hate the update
Let’s say this in the most nice way possible. People are hating the new update! I mean come on! No one wants to see the discover part if a snapchat user would of want to see it they could just subscribe but not that I’m getting to see celebrity I don’t even know snapchats! That is ridiculous! And don’t come with the part that we just need to accept it and get used to it because you can’t get used to something you don’t like!
Everyday I send at least 20-50 snaps to my friend at least a day.... but when i wake up the next day my streak is gone and the two months heart emoji dissapears. You need to fix this asap 😠  Edit: This update is horrible, everything is so messed up and out of place i wish it was back the way it was 
Snapchat USED to be awesome best app on the AppStore. Now it’s hands down one of the worst. Honestly Instagram has a much better system rn. We should all boycott sc until they fix it because rn it’s trash and you know they’ll do something if everyone stops using their terrible app
this new update is terrible. ever since the update my snapchat has been kicking me out of the app ever time i try to go on it or just freezes.
HONESTLY THE UPDATE IS TRASH ! ! First off my Snap updated on it’s own , and I cant find my new messages because I also do streaks . I mean I tried to get accustomed to the new but sometimes new is not good . SO GIVE US ALL BACK OLD SNAP CHAT CAUSE I WANT MY VIEWS BACK !!!!!!
I love Snapchat Nd it always has been working, but it hasn’t fully updated on my phone. I’ve updated it recently Nd the new updates about the font styles Nd the adding more than one caption don’t appear. I’ve uninstalled it several times Nd still the new updates haven’t appeared. Even Snapchat support didn’t help. :(
The update was the worst move snapchat ever made and I barely use an app I would easily open everyday at all anymore 😕
Snapchat literally keeps freezing and lagging on me after I make a snap and then eventually crashes on me. And this isn’t even the first time it’s happened before 😑
This app slow as hell sometimes it lags and crashes with this new update y’all ruined snapchat
I like Snapchat until they came up with this new update now it’s way bad hopefully they can update how it was before
Stories and messages/stories need to go back to being separate pages. This is ridiculous and so hard to use. I’ve been using this app for years and now it’s almost impossible. THIS APP IS NO LONGER USER FRIENDLY. Everyone is leaving stories with instagram pages because they’re giving up on the app. This is awful. Please please please fix  I don’t want y’all to fix the new update. I want the old update back. That’s what the petition (over a million people) are demanding. This isn’t working for your largest group of users and we are using the app substantially less because it’s just not possible. 
Okay you’ve went down from a 4 star rating to a 1.8 star rating on the App Store. Not only that you’ve lost at least $1.9 million due to users not using it for ad revenue. Isn’t the app made for us to have fun on? If so then why haven’t you used any of our opinions about the update and reverting the old snap. 98% of the Snapchat community wants the old snap, why can’t we have it back?
Freaking hate the update. Hate apps that try to decide what I want to see
My Snapchat stories views have dropped over 50% and it’s definitely because of the update. It’s difficult for me to see what my friends are doing in real time  since the stories no longer seem to be in chronological order. I have no idea what’s happening on the “discover page” so I don’t look there anymore. There are a bunch of accounts on there that I know I never followed.  Snapchat’s initial appeal of giving users the ability to watch snaps in real time is no longer there for me. These days I honestly just open my Snapchat camera for the filters and transfer everything over to my IG stories where people can properly watch me and others in chronological order. If Instagram ever updates their filters to comparable quality, I won’t have any use for the Snapchat app. 
This update is ugly and it’s makes no sense... change it back plz
I used to like Snapchat.. but after this update I don’t even open it. It’s a little confusing for me but all my friends quit using it and just talk on Instagram now.  R.I.P to one of the most fun apps I ever used. When a company thinks they are right vs the user base.. everyone loses. So long.
snapchat used to be amazing now it has gone down hill with these new updates. the update is bad enough and then they put another one out. snapchat said that it was going to be back to normal on feb. 20,2018 and it still hasn’t gone back snapchat is a confusing and bad app now i don’t like it anymore. i just want the old snapchat back.
I absolutely hate the new Snapchat update.  I like the way Snapchat was set up before the update.
I don’t like the new update 😞
Over a million people have signed a petition wanting the old Snapchat to be reinstated. This number doesn't even include the amount who hate the change (not everyone has seen the petition) Many have expressed their discontent with the new Snapchat through other social media. It's so unpopular and making "smarter algorithms" is not going to change the fact that most people hate the update.
I liked it wayyy better without the update and also how now I have to fully open the chat when I was really just trying to be sneaky also it is really hard to see the number of streak I already lost 5 because of that then I do not enjoy how the stories r where streaks were meant to be I like my chats and stories separated and third you should just change it back because a lot of people who used to enjoy this app are really disappointed in it
I hate everything about the new update. Please bring back the old snapchat!
the new update was crappy but i got used to it and having been on snapchat for as long as i have its never been slow. but right now because of the new update and the gifs it’s gust so slow. slow to get stickers and type and just slow opening stories.
Snap is different with the update but it's good enough. I had to wait a while to get used to it but it's all good now. I like the new text and the ability to put multiple on the snap. I dislike having stories, people, and chat in the same area. Also, I don't know how to access my friends list. I wish we got a list where we could view all the people we have added. Also, for those of you with issues with streaks, organize them. Do an A// before people's names and it'll be the first how many ever streaks you have on your sending to list. Snap will get better and easier over time.
Wow I don't know you can mess up a good thing so bad. Terrible update. If it ain't broke....
I’m not saying I hate Snapchat but now that they updated there app I don’t use it was much. At first I would talk to all my friends on snap and it was just a easy way to see what there doing or how they have been or they can see what I’m Doing but sadly because of the update we don’t communicate as much and now the app it’s a maze. It sadly is slowly making friends or people I talked to so easily into people I forget are even on my Snapchat. 
Once upon a time Snapchat was my all time favorite app until they decided to change the whole entire layout, now I can’t find anyone’s snapchat story’s they have all this extra stuff mixed in with the story’s and it’s just not as fun as it used to be. I know I’m not the only one who despises the new update and I don’t know why Snapchat hasn’t changed it back yet, but Snapchat HAD 5 stars now they have 2 so that should mean something. Please bring back the old Snapchat
This update makes me want to die
Horrible horrible, they just killed snapchat with this ugly update!
So, Snapchat used to be ya girl's go-to to text everyone ya know because I wasn't trying to see green messages. But now that this new update dropped I now put up with green message because it is hard to even look at this ugly update. Snapchat, yo, I was really feeling y'all. You were up there with Twitter! Now I'm very sad and am forced to use Instagram stories because of this call of action. Please reverse this update so I don't have to see green messages. It's gross, we only fw blue 😕 (and the rating dropped down to a 1.8 because of the update, if you just go back it'd be higher but it's just a suggestion 😴).
New update is trash. Go back to the old one. Might have to stop using this app.
This app used to be the greatest now it’s Wiggity wiggity wack
someone fix this bs update i’m tired of it and i’m now switching to instagram until it’s fixed !
Just change it back the new update is so complicated and stupid!!
Everything about the update is confusing FIX It PLEASE!!!! Go back to the original now because of the update I only use it for the filters to save & post them on instagram I barely use Snapchat it’s too confusing even the discover page is jacked up bring the original settings back or at least give a choice to use the original settings vs the new update
Snapchat has changed so much and i’ve definitely not liked it now.
So tonight I was going through my regular Snapchat stories, when I noticed a cute pupper on the Dodo story, so I screenshotted it. Then I noticed that a notification had been sent to one of my friends, that I screenshotted their chat, when I did not. I then tested this 4 times, doing separate things, not once screenshotting our chat, every time a notification was sent. I then decided to change my password, for a separate reason, when examining the chat that had been sent earlier, I noticed that my new password had also been sent to said snap chatter. This is not okay, and will not go unnoticed.
PLEASE GO BACK TO THE OLD UPDATE PLEASE!!!!!
Bring back the old Snapchat!!!!!!!!
please bring the old layout back but keep all the new features. the only thing i don’t like is the layout.
Having your messages and friends’ Stories all on one page was a terrible idea
You guys should add a streak bar. So like when u take a picture and want it to send to your streaks you would hit that  instead of looking for all them.
It’s so interesting that snapchat is choosing to stand behind an update that’s costing them money and users. I think that the company would be extremely highly regarded if they were to be the first app to really take their consumer base into consideration and admit that they missed the mark with this update. You should really consider reverting back to its old use or, I can assure you, millennials will be done with it. Not to mention that your competition is huge. You can do the same thing on instagram or facebook now. You’re ruining your company for an awful update. It’s not that deep. Give us our layout back or continue to plummet
These app updates just keep getting worst
The update is so bad, my friends and I don't like it at all
New update is horrible.
I don’t like the new update. I don’t need to see stories of people I didn’t subscribe to and never planned to, to begin with. I guess it’s easier to view your friends stories but it’s also easier to accidentally message someone when you didn’t mean to. I liked how stories and texts were separated it was easier to use that. The way stories are all jumbled up together now is overwhelming and kind of annoying to navigate. If I could separate the stories I don’t really care about from the ones I want to actually see then that would be great. I’d like more control over what I want to see and follow instead of what Snapchat thinks I should follow.
Can you please changed it back !!, it’s soo difficult and confusing to use 🙄
Are y’all gonna fix this or nah....please just go back to how things were. Why fix something that wasn’t broken??
Dear Snapchat,  I hate the new update and so do my friends. I am slowly switching to Instagram due to this recent update. You are losing a lot by keeping this update. Please return. 
used to love snapchat, now deleted app. new update too jumbled, cluttered, annoying
Simply ridiculous. I have no words other then that.
Ever since the new update, the app keeps freezing and closing out. I can’t even have streaks anymore. You will lose more users if you don’t reverse the update. Will be deleting soon if not fixed
This is the worst update to a app ever
After the update I have not been able to watch anyone I’m subscribed to. The discover page is out of order and congested with meaningless snaps and ads!
Bye Snapchat. I go to messenger now.
This new update is wack, cant see none of my old convos and cant even watch all of my friend’s snaps less we chatted recently or i physically have ti search their name which isn't happening as i have too many friends
Snapchat is such an amazing app that we use more than 4 hours a day. There’s not even one day we could stop using but unfortunately with the new update it is getting worse and harder to use it was pretty simple and it is complicated and hard to use now. I’m speaking in the behalf of almost all the people that I am following on Snapchat and also I have some friends stopped using snapchat after this new update. I really hope it gets back like the old version.
What the hell were the creators thinking when they thought this new update was a good idea? were they all brainwashed? at the same time? i have a feeling that this new update was a man’s idea. Likewise with the people that voted on this update, probably all men. It’s literally the dumbest layout i have ever seen, how much drugs did they all take at that board meeting where they gave the green light for this update?? I’m just so mad please change it back or give people the option of going back to the old layout because i guarantee 99.999% of people will go back to the old layout (the .001% that wont will be Donald Trump)
Rip
REVERSE THAT ANNOYING UPDATE ‼️
The new update is really bad it would be better if the older user interface is back. My views reach 80 and more , after the awful update they barely cross 30
I’ve tried the new update for a while to see if I could at least get used to it.  And I haven’t.  I still very strongly dislike it.  Please go back to the old update.  It would make me and everybody else happy.
change it back
SIGN THE PETITION WE ARE ALMOST AT 1,500,000 SIGNATURES!!! TO CHANGE IT BACK TO THE OLD BASIC FORMAT
As someone who regularly uses multiple social media platforms, Snapchat used to be one of my favorites. I loved being able to send pictures to my friends and then seeing what they were up to via their stories. HOWEVER, the new update is difficult to use, and annoyingly cluttered. It’s now hard to keep track of snaps sent to me, and it’s more difficult to watch stories. If something doesn’t go back to the way it was, Snapchat might become a thing of the past. 
I’m still unhappy and confused. Please go back to classical edition.  3/4 of all features is junk and garbage.  Just a waste of time.
I hate the new update.
I love the Snapchat app how it was before. It has gotten too confusing to add to my story. It tends to sort of glitch(?) Like the whole are where I click on my bitmoji will waver a bunch of times and not let me click it until it stops having a seizure of sorts. Every time I try to see someone’s story it just leads me to chat with them like 3 times and it just makes me not want to even see any story. I also hate looking to the right side where all the “popular” stories are at because there’s people there I don’t even want to see smothered in with the ones I do that I end up not even seeing anything and just closing the app all together...
You guys tried to pull a Steve Jobs “Nobody knows what they want until you give it to them.” And it ended tragically. Take the L put the TL back in order watch your ratings go back up 🙏🏿.
Please bring back the old snap chat.. the new one is annoying and it’s hard to see people’s snap
No explanation needed. The update is awful.
Ya Blew It Snapchat, Bring Back The Old Version.
It's trash, simply put.
I used to get CRaZy views on my Snapchat but ever since the update my views have dropped drastically which means NOBODY is using or opening up the app. What's the point in uploading content if no one is going to see it??? Snapchat is trash now. Honestly, all of these social media platforms switch up on us and expect us to remain loyal. Stop acting brand new! #NotOpeningDisloyalAppsIn2018
snapchat was clean, usable, and straightforward before the update. put stories back where they belong, and stop arranging the chats out of chronological order. this was a horrible idea that clearly integrated no user input or beta testing because girl. what.
Force update is trash. Old layout where time line and msgs wee separate was superb! Bring back old layout please and thank you!!!
I hate how you have to pay for the filters that is honestly pretty ridiculous
Snap chat still hasn’t gone back to its previous layout despite plummeting ratings and reviews. Pay attention to what your consumers want or Snapchat will tank. I’m ready to delete it pretty soon because I don’t even watch the stories any more.
Snap chat was seriously one of my favorite apps and now i HATE using it. Everything is so clustered and unorganized. I can’t see everyone’s stories—i only see the same 10 people at the top. I also hate that they took away chronological order!! They’re shoving promoted content in our face and featuring snap chatters that i have no interest in watching! There’s a reason why i don’t have them added. Seriously, snap chat was so good and now it’s absolute garbage. I’d appreciate if you guys listened to what thousand of reviewers are saying and bring back the separate pages for personal snaps and stories.
The update is terrible and the layout is so messy and confusing.
(2/09/18)  Snapchat used to be amazing. It’s my birthday and let me say, I just got the update, worst birthday EVER. I freaking hate it, it’s so cluttered and unorganized. It looks horrible I hate the way you view stories now I just want the old Snapchat back. I’m probably going to stop using it.  Edit- (2/25/18)  Dude. Please just change Snapchat back to the way it was before this entire mess. No one like the new update and adding more random pages doesn’t help 
u guys went from 5 stars to a lot more 1 star and down to 1.8 review if y’all want to get back to 5 star just take down the update can’t you see that none of us like it we hate the update i thought you guys are suppose to please us and have us like the app not hate it just reverse the update bring back the old snapchat now please‼️‼️‼️ASAPPPPP CHANGE IT BACK NOWWW
Snapchat should go back to the old version , but stay with some of the cool new stuff. And we should be able to delete the conversations completely like delete it.
The new interface is so hard to use!
Congrats!
Battery is destroyed by this app even at 30% or above
If Kylie Jenner stated that she isn’t on Snapchat anymore, because of this update, there’s a problem. There’s an over abundance of commercial ads. My feed/timeline is hard to navigate. The conversation bay acts on its own terms. I actually regret not deleting this app from my phone, because of the new update. Please, take heavy consideration into reverting back towards the older version of Snapchat. The good thing about this update, is actually the different options we have to give our captions a unique twist; rather than using the plain, old, classic text. I ask, along with fellow users that you may change this horrible update.
Snapchat is not the same and the new update ruined it. I prefer the IG story. Snapchat is trash now. Sorry not sorry.
I dislike the update , bring back the old one
A lot of people say they’re going to stop using snapchat because of the new update and they keep complaining about it. Honestly, I hate the update but it’s not bad enough to make me want to stop using the app. If this is what they want to do I’ll adjust, and by now I’ve already gotten used to it.
This is actually really important at a business perspective, the Apple Watch and other smart watches are popular devices. There needs to be a designated app for Snapchat on the Apple Watch. Look at all the other popular social media, Instagram and Facebook messenger all have Apple Watch apps. You don’t even have to allow to view pictures and stuff but at least allow the chats. I’m not using Snapchat for chats anymore because of this, now I only use it for story and streaks. And I would really want to use it for chats again so please look into my suggestion.
I loved Snapchat. It was the only app I used and there wasn’t a second I wasn’t on it. This update is the worst thing ever and it’s made me lose all my streaks (something I take seriously) and I barely use the app anymore due to the chaotic and unorganized new layout. I’m extremely angered that it’s been weeks of negative feedback and still nothing has been done. Would’ve been a five-star rating last month.
Actually don't even know what Snapchat developers were even thinking with this new update. I don't know if your able to revert updates, but Snapchat should definitely do that. This is just unacceptable.
Bro literally no. The updates that are happening are unacceptable. The newest one includes the search of gifs and “throwing away” all of what you type. Right-handed people, can you all agree that when you’re trying to move the text to the middle it accidentally goes in the trash???? Snapchat, we are capable of selecting a whole message and deleting it. Tired of this
The new update and layout is trash. Please reverse update it!
The most recent update has ruined this app. It’s confusing and annoying. I don’t even want to open the app anymore. It’s just disgusting.
Please revert the user interface to the prior updates please!
The new interface is awful. Why would you combine stories with normal snaps????no one likes, please listen to your userbase
really disappointed in the update.
This update is trash🚮
The new update is trash . And the newest update i dont even have ! Please update my snapchat so i can have fonts like all of my friends . Im sorry to say snapchat hut instagram and twitter are doing way better than you . You gotta do better!!
Y’all’s update is horrible and many people agree with it and dislike it  Change it back 
Okay Snapchat where do I start? This update makes me feel so disorganized and cluttered. I have a lot of friends on Snapchat and I feel like I only see like 5 stories of the 250 stories that I used to see on the old update. I don’t even go on Snapchat anymore because it’s literally impossible to use now. I’m so disappointed because this used to be my favorite app. Go back to the old update, you maybe making money off of the new algorithm but the reviews don’t look so promising... 
I love Snapchat and have met some amazing people through it but seriously, I'm having trouble talking to them because of this new update, I can't open snaps that they send, it freezes, it lags, it crashes.I don't know if I'm the only one with these problems but please fix it. It's annoying and I'm fed up.
One star till you fix the update
If my streaks weren’t so high Snapchat would be deleted
Not really a fan of the new update...the old way was a lot better...it was far more easier to navigate and get to things and such and the set up of it was so much nicer looking...was really upset when I logged on one day to just see that my Snapchat updated on its own and changed to the new version...
okay i used to absolutely love snapchat i used it all the time to talk to friends throughout the day and i would try and keep super long streaks just for fun BUT THIS UPDATE IS AWFUL. I HATE IT. ITS SO SLOW. I GO TO CLICK ON A SNAPCHAT THAT I GOT “JUST NOW” FROM SOMEONE AND SNAPCHAT HAS TO REFRESH. I DONT KNOW WHY. BUT IT JUST HAS TO REFRESH. THEN IM IN SOMEONES CHAT WHO I HAVENT TALKED TO FOR LIKE A YEAR. ITS WEIRD I HATE THIS UPDATE.
Just move the stories to other side, and make the streak numbers larger... please.
Surprise surprise! Another Snapchat user who hates the update. 1 star is too generous of a rating for this. Somehow, the app updated by itself—even when automatic updates on my phone were turned off. Anyways, I’ve barely been using the app ever since and I don’t even bother looking at anyone’s stories. This update is garbage. Please revert back to the old layout or come out with another update that is completely different from this one. Thanks.
Latest update is pure garbage and u can choke
please listen to your users and change this new design. It’s confusing, unorganized, and frustrating to use. Your twitter customer service said people would eventually get used to the update however I still have yet to see or hear any positive reaction to the new layout
These new updates are terrible. Bye snapchat
Snapchat for the past 3 years had by far been my favorite form of social media. It was simple nice and it was an easy way for me to communicate with my friends. Now it is none of these things. The new snapchat is cluttered and the stories and snaps on the same page is just confusing. Snapchat used to have two separate features. Chats and stories. Now that they are together it just isn’t the same. I will most definitely start using Snapchat less and move on to using instagram more.
I’m not minding the update anymore. except!, You guys should make a special slot for your streaks. like where the groups-Stories-All are. Put it up there and label it streaks. so it’s not to hard to know where your streaks are
Y’all need to GET RID OF THE UPDATE. By the next year, no one will be using snapchat if you all keep this up. Just saying.
Okay okay so i love snapchat. I mainly only use it for streaks but that’s besides the point. I’ve had snapchat for a long time and the new update is just bleh. I’m used to it now but it still feels really really cluttered.Also my username is really cringe and it bothers me. I wish i could change it. You all said if we want a new username we have to delete our acc and make a new one. i’m not doing that, my score is over 200k and i have a 440 day streak and a lot of streaks that i’m not willing to lose. Y’all let loren gray change her username so why can’t we. I know this for a fact. You let famous people change their usernames but not us. Her username used to be lorensodrizzy bc i added her like a year ago and now its loren. Let us change our usernames. It isn’t fair. If you don’t want people to constantly change them, then make it to where you can only change it once. Please please do this. Please. Also since you made bitmoji deluxe can you make the outfits more customizable?? Thank you!
Snapchat was so great before, now I hate that everything is out of order. I want to see who I most recently snapped, not who posted on their story. Please fix it so it goes back to normal, your rating obviously reflect that no one likes the new update. All the other features are cool but get rid of the combined feed. It’s wack.
We got used to discovery feature and around the world stories, which where fun for awhile. Now it’s all messed up, and difficult to use or even to stare at!  Instagram story will take over if this kept going without further changes. 
I don’t like it because I can’t fine none of my friends snap and that’s really upsetting. But everything else is good. But I really hate that I have to hunt for SOME of my friends snap and the rest I just can’t find I want the old snap to come back😫
Snapchat has been great for as long as I’ve had it, but for some reason they decided to mess with everything it had going for it. Everything has become a clumped together, cluttered, unpleasant looking mess. I’m sure all of these ideas sound good on paper, being able to look at someone’s story by tapping in your contacts, making the discover page it’s own thing, and recommended stories in discover, it doesn’t sound bad. However, in practice, everything feels cramped and unusable. It’s difficult to see when someone’s messages you, sending out streaks is a chore, and just generally finding who you want to message is a challenge. Everything that was working amazingly has been taken out and replaced, with the only good addition being new Bitmojis, which nobody cares that much about. Keep the bitmojis, role everything else back, and I think everyone will be so much happier.
Ruined the app for me and all my friends that use it. All I need to say
Update was implemented and it's trash 🤷🏽‍♂️
I really dont like the new update it’s disturbing to me, the old version was so nice. The new storys i dont like, u have three pages for a reason use them dont put everything on two pages i dont like it
Get the old one back, this update wack. I get less views and It’s retarded how you post on your story. Get the old one back. That would be much appreciated for snapchatters like me.
I tried to get used to the update over the course of two weeks but the fact is that The app is simply annoying. No longer can I view my friend’s stories unless I talk to them everyday or search for their stories on my own. This update has made me feel so disconnected from the friends that I don’t get to talk to on an everyday basis and instead connects me with celebrities that I honestly could care less about. I used to adore snapchat and all of its features and would spend a good portion of my time on there but now I find it hard to even open the app because it is so displeasing. I can’t see my friends’ stories and I can’t see who I recently talked to in a simple manner. This update is overall really disappointing and I’m pretty upset that snapchat has not reverted back to an easier version.
Snapchat used to be the best app out there!!! The update killed they're own product.
Hate this update
Don’t like the new update hopefully they fix it soon  But I would recommend the app for storing photos and they’re filters are always great 
This is awful.
I absolutely hate the new layout.
You could’ve made a better update, it’s just messed up and lots of problems with the new update. Stories and everything are so unorganized. I miss the old snapchat. You should’ve kept the same set up, and just redesigned it and maybe also bring back where you could see everyone’s bestfriend list. So unorganized. Maybe you all should hurry and think of something that could bring your rating back up. Just saying....  Part 2: snapchat is glitching still, the app is so slow, and when I want to tap on the picture my friend sent me on the messenger side to make it closer won’t do that it just saves or gets unsaved. This app is stupid now that you’ve changed it. Thanks snapchat, y’all better do something about it because everyone hates this! 
change it man.
This new update kinda makes me wanna die. Pls change back :(
Y’all smh 🤦🏽‍♂️ y’all need a button that says send to all streaks plz do that cuz my lazy a** is tired of tapping on every person I got a streak with u know how long it takes when it could be simple one button
Used to love the app but this new update makes it impossible to use; its clunky, confusing, and overall just an awful experience. Also the way the snaps constantly switch order, seemly randomly, it’s hard to even have a conversation bc of this.
honestly this new update is making me so angry. like why would you add a feature to freaking delete the text????? WHAT IF I WANT TO PLACE MY TEXT THERE?!?!?!? DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES MY FREAKING TEXT HAS BEEN DELETED SINCE YOU PLACED THAT STUPID FEATURE THERE???? LIKE AS IF YOU DIDNT RUIN THE FREAKING APP ENOUGH ALREADY.
Everything was fine and dandy before the update and now all hell has broke loose. Everything is jumbled and out of order now. They took the fun out of Snapchat, and they need to change it back.
The new Snapchat update is very difficult to use. I can not swipe up and reply to people’s story and I can’t see everyone’s story unless I search them up. Snapchat use to be my favorite app before the update eventually I am going to uninstall it because it is not as enjoyable to be on as it use to be I recommend changing Snapchat to the way it use to be.
This new update is horrible! Everything is so backwards now. It makes me not even want to post as often as I used to. Please bring back the old Snapchat!
With the recent update this week, I deleted my all conversations with everyone and since I did that I am unable to watch anyone's story, you guys gotta update AGAIN.
Snapchat was a beautiful place for me to make weird pictures and send weird vids to my friends and communicate in general... until this update happened... I open my snap expecting the usual and then I see this my phone updated 😪 shame bruh shame but I gotta keep those streaks so... I guess I’ll deal
Thought yall were changing it back ION SEE THATTTTTTTT CHANGEEEE ITTTTTT BACKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!
Ive been using snapchat since the app was created and I love it! Its so easy to communicate with friends and the filters always keep me entertained! I also love the new bitmojis as they now offer more variety. However, the new update makes it hard to see my friends stories unless I snap them constantly. Additionally, snapchat is now showing me stories of people I don't follow or care about. One day I saw a story from Kim Kardashian and I almost threw up! 🤢 The update doesn’t look nice and it made everything complicated and no one asked for that. If you don’t have snapchat already I wouldnt recommend the app as its not fun anymore!
Bring back the old sc please i use it 24/7 and i dont even like it anymore
I love Snapchat. Well, that is until this awful update that just came out. I would’ve given this app five stars. It’s the best way to keep in touch with my friends and family. But it’s so confusing now, I hate it. Apparently everyone else hates it too because the reviews are not good.  If Snapchat is wise, they will take it back to the way used to be.
I’m about a days worth of useless stories away from deleting this pathetic piece of trash. They should call it trash app because its developers are trash, the CEO is trash, the shareholders (whose 🍆 the CEO of Snapchat is gagging on daily) are trash and the entirety of executives who had a hand in this update are trash. I enjoyed Snapchat exactly for the ability to steer clear of worthless stories from people I don’t care for. I could delete a friend at will and not care for seeing their stories ever again. Now I’m not only seeing stories of total strangers who’s lives I don’t care for seeing, but I’m seeing worthless stories from already pathetically moronic people that Snapchat enables. Just because there’s an attractive female airman making a Snapchat story doesn’t mean she’s worth broadcasting. Especially considering 1. She’s driving while snap chatting in her story and 2. She’s driving while snapchatting on base which is a total violation. Both of which just enable the stupidity of mankind to levels unimaginable. Total disregard for others lives and safety and with a doubling down of the drug known as attention, given to you by your trash drug-dealer: Snapchat. We are careening over a cliff into the movie Idiocracy, and like Ugandan knuckle warrior tribes of old Snapchat is not just showing us de wey, they are kicking us all over with this pathetic update.
Seriously? Who asked for that? Put it back to how it was and you can have your 5 stars back :)
It says "you're using an outdated version, please update before you reopen the app" but brutha I can't smh
Its ending my streaks for no reason,, I log out log in then my streaks are there buh it keeps happening ! It’s super slow! Don’t have same stickers as other ! Glitches to much!! Fix this!
This update needs to be taken back
the new update is so sad and cluttered, i don’t even open it anymore:/
This app is like if Instagram would let you see how many people recently saw an old post of yours
I updated Snapchat two times and I still don’t have the new fonts.
I don't know if it's the update but uhhhh I can't see my memories I have wifi on and phone data and it doesn't load it just closes app, also I tried changing setting and also just closed out. Can't really do nothing cause it closes automatically? Is that part of a glitch orrrrrrrrrrrreee
who decided this update was a good idea???  Give us that old thing back... 
Used to love Snapchat but the new update is confusing, it’s hard to find stories of influencers and popular accounts with the new set up. Instastories is much more user friendly. I’ll probably end up deleting snap, it’s not as easy to use anymore.
do not download if you want to be confused and see stories about people you don’t care about.
So frustrated with Snapchat. Finally decide to fix the miserable update and what do you know it’s not compatible with iPhone X wow
Come on snap. You can see your ratings have gone to crap. Bring the old snap back. Keep some of the new features. But get rid of this crap!
The update makes snapchat not as fun as it used to be. The older version was a lot more easy to find things and I haven’t been using snapchat as much as I used too now.
Every time I try and open the app it is very slow and takes a while to load in. Finally when it loads in I cannot double tap on the chat to respond for a while. Go back to the old Snapchat
First the app updated on its own and now I’ve lost half of my streaks even tho I sent streaks to them and sent it back within 24 hours. Went on snapchats website and requested them back and got told they couldn’t restore them. The app has gone downhill so fast. I’m thinking about deleting it.
I am very upset at the update. I want my recents in chronological order of when I last snapped them, I want all of my stories in one location as it used to be, I DO NOT like that text is now deleted by sliding it over the trash can, I want the “magazines” in one spot as they used to be, and I DO NOT want celebrity/public stores separate from my regular stories as I forget they are there and never get a chance to watch them anymore. This update is TERRIBLE, put it back to how it was. No one is happy with this update.
All this is just to clustered for me I try to have conversations with people I send a text to them and they are moved down like 5-19 people and I hate it please go to the original version
The update has absolutely changed the app for me. Everything is smashed into one page and the conversation list is jumbled and unorganized. There are people at the top of my list who I haven’t spoken to in years. Please change the app back to the original design. It is much more organized and easy to navigate.
Snapchat has always been my favorite social media app but he update isn’t enjoyable . Snapchat is more complicated and frankly Snapchat was A LOT better before this update .
I hate the update
Plz Allow People to have an option whether they want the old snapchat back
I lost viewers so I’m not using it anymore!
Very Baaaaaad
I don’t even check out the public stories anymore. It’s hard enough to navigate between the actual snap messages and stories my friends have posted, but you tab over and there are so many random peoples snapchats mixed in with the other stories. It’s just a mess. I hardly open the app anymore. I wonder how much longer they can keep this up?
At this point, it doesn’t even matter if you want the new update or not. Snapchat will automatically update your Snapchat version. Ridiculous update. Not sure why proceed with a  “update”, Snapchat when you’re getting so much backlash from users. Smh.
This poor excuse of an update has made me use Instagram for my story and geo tagging. Why fix something that was not broke? Y’all messed this one up, please revert it back, if it wasn’t for my 3 year + streaks would I have not deleted this app instantly since the new update, who ever designed it needs to be fired and the ceo supporting it and basically telling us to get used to it needs to accept failure and go back to its normal design. It seems sort of desperate for money letting adds almost your whole app. Gross.
hate the new format
I love, love, love snapchat. It’s probably one of my most-used apps. But the new update really makes it difficult to use. It’s extremely unorganized being all on one page and makes it difficult to just snapchat your friends instead of looking at everyone’s stories. The stories and snaps you receive need to be on separate pages!!! And the snaps you receive aren’t in chronological order which makes no sense
Combining stories and personal snaps doesn’t work well at all. Clutters the whole app and made it a pain to use.  Update: Can’t swipe open chats anymore. How hard is it to just separate everything. 
really bad update
Literally no reason to make this update to the ui. Stories are jumbled and recent convos are all over the place. Stop yourself snapchat.
put the format back!
terrible the update is just terrible
With all due disrespect, the app is still trash. I was trying to give it a chance but i can’t. First update was trash and confusing. Then you updated it again and it’s still trash. Like why is it so hard for me to view my own story. Why is the app so segregated. We just want the old Snapchat back. The one you told you were going to give us on feb. 20. But no, we just got another TRASH update. Goodbye
it's chop
They seriously need to change the update back. It is so annoying. I always respond to the wrong people now. Honestly might delete Snapchat.
F*** whoever’s idea it was to go f****** s*** up.
give us back the old snapchat 😭😭
It’s no good. Change it back😩 i liked Snapchat so much before it.
Can't even get out of the picture roll without using the home button. Stories no longer in Discovery. I literally use this for chatting now and that's it. Terrible.
I can’t find all of my friends stories or all my friends and the app is so much harder to navigate
It is very hard to utilize Snapchat now.
this is so unorganized and people i don’t talk to are popping up!! CHANGE THE UPDATE
i liked the updated but i hate it not even in order when u txt plp cmon snap fix i am probably gunna leave snap in the next 3 months if this doesn’t get fixed
stories all ugly i’m tryna see who’s best friends are who
I hate the new update and I don’t get that many views anymore on Snapchat so can you please go back to the old one or make a new one! Snapchat is ruining my snap experience.
Horrible. Just bad.
Bad update
I love Snapchat my all time favorite go to app but since the update I really haven’t been using it as much, hate the fact that when I’m on the discover page and I’m viewing stories of people I’m subscribed to, they are almost impossible to find and then when I do view I go back later in the day and have to view the WHOLE story again just to see there most recent posts! Plus all the random people I probably wouldn’t follow but still end up having to see
The update ruined this app.
Update is trash! Rather direct snaps separate from story .  It’s more news and advertising oriented now
I didn’t ask for this update. Nobody did. Besides the fact that nothing is in chronological order (stop trying to be Instagram because we don’t like that either), Snapchat has now added a feature of suggested stories to watch. If I wanted to watch these people, I would’ve just added them as friends. Also, all of these ads? Unnecessary. Snapchat is trying too hard and it’s showing. Please go back to the original with the time of someone’s story available, everything in chronological order and with none ads.   Haven’t used/deleted the app since the update. 
I hate the new update...it just feels overwhelming, cluttered, and messy. I wish I wasn’t like this because now I rarely go on it 😑 change it back please!
it says that my sc updated but i never got the update that has the new fonts and stuff like that and it’s annoying
I hate the update and I think it's terrible. Will not be using Snapchat anymore
my snapchat has worked perfectly fine for the 4 years i had it until now. as i get a notification on snap from one of my friends i click it and when i open the snap my whole snapchat crashed and my whole friends list dissapeard i just told the snap chat help center but i am panicking extremely because i have over 600 people on there and i do not want to lose all of my contacts
Had to delete after the new update. Too cluttered and I really don’t care for the features Snapchats.
I’ll change my rating when this horrible update is reversed. This is obnoxiously bad.
Bye, sorry, NEXT.
This new update is trash! Stop Trying to tell me what it is I want to see! 
If I could give this update zero stars I would, it’s just absolutely terrible
This update is trash and you know it is .. but people only use Snapchat because there is no app that really compares. And you just messed it all up like trump did when he chose to run for president. Didn’t you make the app to entertain us not to go for how YOU wanted it to be. It’s unorganized and tacky and you really need to reconsider making a new update.
Dear Snapchat,  You may have noticed the extremely negative reaction from Snapchat users after the update. Please, please, PLEASE reverse it. It was much better when private snaps and stories were separate. Now, I hardly even look at stories because of the update, and I’m sure I’m not the only one. 
the app crashes everytime I try to make a video or camera
I get that you need to evolve your product so it doesn't get stale, but the latest update makes this app significantly less enjoyable to use. No one will be upset if you just take it back and go back to the old version. No one.
I before use snap chats every day .. but with new updates it’s very difficult to use it to watch the story.. so I didn’t open it ..
The new update is just all over the place. Please change
The new update has been horrible. It lagged so much it shut my whole app down. The update is just awful in general. You honestly need to change it back to how it was. I do not like that never someone texts you and you go to look at it it pops it right up to the top of the messages bc it confuses me when I’m trying to talk to someone and another persons name pops up and I click that one instead. Y’all just need to change it back
fastest death since YikYak
Wow thanks for putting stories back in one spot. It's still not interesting, I no longer go look at peoples story's to waste time.  People want them in order by TIME, not by what you guys ASSUME WE WANT TO SEE. I don't want to see stories of the people I only talk to. I want to see everyone's and in time order. Can't even properly go to my lists of friends,  I have to search names. Snapchat really messed up with this. I'm keeping my review at one star. 
You went from like 3.0 to 1.8. The old snapchat was unique. It was the best. This is terrible. I hate going on snapchat now. I don’t even know where to go anymore. Snapchat was dominating. Not anymore. There’s an old saying. Don’t fix something if it’s not broken. This applies for the Gail that snapchat did.
Please return to the old version.
After the new update I was hardly on Snapchat only because I hated it today I decided to delete it until snapchat gets it together!
Please change the update and make it how it was before. Please. The new update makes it so stressful to use the app. I liked the separate story page. Now, I send a snap and 5 seconds later, my feed is replaced with a hundred new stories, and if they reply, it gets lost in the masses.
The new update is such a pain to work with . i barely open anyones stories or view the new stories on the story page . Before the update it was a great go to media but im back to instagram :/ sorry snap but bring us back
hard to use and they need to reverse it because it only goes downhill from here for snapchat if they don’t
hi! is there some sort of bug going around making the app glitch? everytime i press on the app is goes on and then brings me to a black screen and then back to my home page! please change the fact that i see famous people's stories that i am not subscribed to. it is very irritating. also, if you could separate the stories from the business/organization snapchats that would be great. Also, if you could separate private messaging and stories from each other. One more thing, if you could make people's stories not disappear from there account after you watch it. it is so hard to rewatch a story a little while later and even find people's stories.... So, in other words, if you could just change back to the old update that would be 110% amazing!!
Can't you just leave something that's already good how it is? The new update completely ruins snapchat. Trash
Dead snapchat please give us back the d snapchat this new snapchat is way more difficult to use i hate it
Horrible update
I’m sorry but The new update is 🤮🤮 can you guys change it back originally to how it was
I hate it
I’ve been using Snapchat for a while now and I love it to death but after the recent update I’ve been having a hard time liking it. It is way harder to navigate and use it since the stories and chats page were emerged. It’s harder to keep up with your chats when the section is arranged by who posts on their story and not by who’s texting you. I strongly believe that we need separate sections for each thing (chats, stories, discover). Another fix that would be very beneficial without changing the current layout would be arranging the chats page by recent messages not by stories. Please fix!
bruh take this update off yall trippin fr
Before you could see the last people you had contact with in order, but now that same list is also updated with anybody who updates his/her story. There were some good things about this update, but the stories should have stayed to the right with the conversations on the left because they are not the same. If it’s fixed I’ll fix this review.
Hate the update
I would just like to say that snapchat used to be my favorite app and form of social media. Everything was going great until.. Yes you guessed it that update! Ever since that update I have had problems logging into my account and being signed out numerous amounts of time. I don’t like instagram and Snapchat has made me resort to going back to facebook! Ha Jk Facebook trash🤣
Honestly I thought the old update was better, but the new format isn’t that good now
I was just starting to use Snapchat and then they did the update.   This is now horrible. I can’t follow my friends stories and my subscriptions are now just mixed in with everything else.  Hate the new update and will not be using Snapchat any longer.
I loved Snapchat, now I don’t open it. It’s just a hassle with the new update and clutter I don’t want to see.
The new update is wack Snapchat used to be my favorite app but now it’s not all the stories & messages are all together that’s not cool you should really change that update nobody likes it
I have an suggestion you should make an option so you can set it back to the old Snapchat in setting?!!
If there’s goin to be so much media and celebrities integrated could we at least have a side with only our friends????? Please
The new update is horrendous, please I back to the old snap chat, story interface is no longer user friendly, it's way to cluttered and I can't find anything !! Still garbage
This update is broken. My Snapchat has been acting weird since this update has come out. Snapchat developers listen to the people who use your app and back to the original set up. No one likes the new update.
FIX IT JESUS. IDC ABOUT RANDOM PEOPLES STORIES ON DISCOVER??
i will ditch this app bc of this update. i see FEWER ads btw. suckssss
No one wants this update. Snapchat’s stocks went down BECAUSE they don’t listen to the people’s opinion. Literally no one likes the update. Once they get their act together, I’ll redownload Snapchat but until then I am more than happy with instagram stories
I hate the new update with a burning passion of a thousand fires. It is so annoying that whenever anyone posts something on their story they pop right up on my feed. Would give this zero stars but that isn’t an option. I loved Snapchat but this update makes me hate it.
Hate this new update.  Specially how I’m being forced to watch people’s stories that I don’t even follow?? What the hell is that? I don’t follow them for a REASON!!! and that’s all I see. Strangers feed all over. All I click is “not interested”, “don’t want to see this”.  It’s really annoying.  Snapchat is to send videos/pics to people we actually know. Like our friends and family. and sometimes celebrities/bloggers we actually like and find entertaining.  Strangers and celebrities we find annoying? Um no! 
Snapchat was my main source for communication now i would much rather text because the update confuses me snapchats rating has gone down significantly because of it instead of making changes to fix it the should just revert back to the old Snapchat the minute they do they’ll have five stars from me for now its one
Snapchat used to be my favorite app but now i use it as rarely as possible because of this stupid update. Over 2 million people signed a petition requesting it to be changed back to the way it was and they have done nothing. They let a press release out saying they “heard what the users were saying” but proceeded to say they were not going to change it. This update is trash and Snapchat needs to get over its pride and change it back to the way people like it.
Y'all need to bring back the old Snapchat asap
Horrible update!
Todo era perfecto hasta la última actualización 🤮
I rarely even use it now!
bring the old snapchat back.
change it back to normal
Aye y’all tighten up! This is how MySpace feel off!
this app used to be number 1 in social now it’s at the bottom with 1.8* Rating we all agree that we miss the old design Snapchat is so disorganized now about the new update all the stories are piled up together like junk and it’s just unacceptable I love the new bitmojis I hope that stays but if everything was more organized I’d give it a 5 star for sure 😕
The new update is awful and cluttered, why can’t it go back to where you could see eachothers friends top 3 best friends
This new update sucked enough as it is now every time i open snapchat while airplaying to my tv for anything (responding to a chat, not even using the camera function) it interrupts whatever im playing and makes me start over from the beginning its super frustrating and only started happening after yall released this crap update that everyone hates please at least fix this so the update is a little bit more bearable like for f**ks sake this is ridiculous
The new update brings people up I never talk to and it's getting hard to talk to one specific person since it's all clustered out of order. It brings everything to the top. It's even harder watch stories. I like the new update where you can select to watch someone's story since I don't know how many stories people snap I end up watching someone's story I didn't want to watch (from someone I dislike, or not interested in their story) it's really messy not even organized one bit. Someone told me you were going to revert this so I waited patiently but it seems like it's not going to. I'm fed up with all of this I even tried to revert back to the old Snapchat, you didn't even give us the option of selecting to choose this new update. Therefore your unjust actions have consequences evidently as shown in the reviews.
New update is trash
It's awful
Update just pushes the agenda of advertisers more, makes it hard to watch stories and floods the feed with random stimulus not interested. Feel like my whole live is Ads and bs content.
The new update makes the app terrible. I don’t like how everything is in one place, people and stories 👎🏼 Old snaps come back even after I delete them, and even older snaps that I have deleted before! needs a new BETTER update or go back to the old one! Please & Thanks!
Alright Snapchat quit playing and fix the set up of the app. Ya people are still using it but I still hate the set up. Keep my snaps with people and my friends snap stories separate. It’s confusing.
I honestly wonder why companies like snapchat don’t listen to their consumers. I’m contemplating on deleting the app at this point because the new update is just god awful. My stories are out of order, to rewatch someone I have to look them up again, I always accidentally swipe left and it brings me to the chat box, it lags so bad, and so much more.
I can’t see any of my streaks, I send snaps within 24 hours (so does the other person) and my streaks just disappear
You need to get it to where your parents can see everything you do on the app other wise it ain't a bad app but my parents won't let me have it unless they can see everything I do on it so plz help me and make it so my parents can see everything I do
i love snapchat, i use it all day everyday. but recently i have noticed that everyone got an update where you can change the fonts, but i never received it. i have the latest update where it says that i am able to change it but i can’t. can someone tell me why?
Look, this just isn’t okay. I tried my best to like this new update but at the end of the first day I wanted to actually die. Is this some kind of cruel joke intended to make us all suffer? Who did this? Whatever team is in charge of what happened here, fire them all. Just go back to the way things were don’t make people hate you, you had such a good thing going until you absolutely ruined it with your own stupidity.  Sincerely, twitch.tv/sqwoop 
Personally i love snapchat. but with this new update, im starting to hate it. half the time, when some snaps are on my lock screen they wont even show up on the app. i, and many others, want the old, easier to use, less glitchy snapchat back.
The new Snapchat update is horrible . Make me not even want to have a snapchat . I’m losing my streaks bc of it. I woke up one morning and almost all of them were gone . Y’all better do something about this.
Snapchat’s new update is absolutely garbage
When I open a message , it still says that I have that message when I close the app / refresh the app. I’ve even tried signing out of the app and restarting my phone and it still doesn’t work. Please fix! 🙁
Need the old version back don’t like the new one smh
I know you’re trying to fix it, but it hasn’t gotten there yet. First off: just separate the stories from the regular snaps, like they used to be! You came close by making a separate page for stories, but there’s still no separate page for regular snaps – it’s either “stories” or “all” (snaps+stories). Still remarkably unhelpful. Second: removing the swipe right to chat feature makes it a lot more difficult to use. You need to get rid of the swiping between pages, just have buttons to tap on. 
Update is still very inefficient
This is update is horrible. I’m sending the wrong snapchats to the wrong people and it’s bad. Me and a lot of old people want the old snap back.
Please just change it back
Do I even need to say 🤦🏾‍♂️
Other than the new snap update is total trash! I hate when I’m snapping someone and their name goes to the bottom of the list... like no. Why go to the bottom?! I hate that none of my friends I snap are at the top and I have to go fishing for them. I hate this snap. And I know you said we can get use to it. But I hate this new snap. I’ve had this app since 2012. Y’all might just lose another user! I hate this update
This new update is just everywhere.. Everyone is just everywhere in my timeline. Seems snapchat is trying to be more like Facebook I have a whole section of just random people, posts, news and ext ... too much advertisement I would say..
Go back to the way it was when your friends stories could be watched more than once in 24 hours!
i used to LOVE this app but when it updated oml you should really update it back to the old one 😊
Crashes every time I take a snap! Please fix!
Clunky lay-out plus the constant screen snap send popping up. I’ve lost all my love for Snapchat I’ve looked at it maybe three times in the last couple weeks and I used watch it everyday. I’m not a big snapper anyways but I do like watching some of the stories. All I noticed is you’ve added 20 ads. For every other story you feature. That’s why I used to love you. Booo!
Trash.
So before this update i had a stock in snapchat and ever since the update its gone DOWN. I lost $20 from the snapchat stock. And the perfect solution to make the stock go up is to bring back the old update! :) so please do that, Im not even a business person. I also lost a 675 streak, yes you heard it, 675 DAY STREAK and yall wouldnt revive it. And i send my streaks every morning so there had to be a misconnection there because of the update. SO im not happy with snapchat. Ive had snapchat since 5th grade, and my score is at 715,000. And i am so disappointed in snapchat.. the only reason I still have it is because of my 930 day streak! And if that disappears, then im officially done with snapchat, oh wait im already done with it hahah yeah its time for Google to step up the game and produce something similar Snapchat’s got
The new update is garbage don’t get it
PLEASE BRING BACK OLD UPDATE
💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
So I’ve had the update for a few weeks and I still hate it. There are WAY too many clicks involved to view friends stories and your own story and who had viewed what. This update has not grown on me. It just frustrates me more. I’ve stopped getting in even though I use to use it every single day.
still mad about the update barely anyone watches people’s stories anymore...
HATE IT.
I would give you a 5 Star but I hate the new update and so does everyone else. So you get a 3 Star. Everyone would like the old Snapchat back that doesn’t screw you over and make everything confusing. It’s actually the most annoying update I’ve ever seen.
Snapchat had a perfect setup prior to this update. The new interface is a mess and I can't think of any logical reason for Snapchat to keep it but if they want to be stupid and lose users that's their call ig
I use the app to stay updated with my friends/people I know. I don't care to watch people I don't knows Snapchat and I don't want to discover anything!!!!!! You have officially ruined the app for me.
Update ruined everything
This update is terrible and annoying, please reverse you stupid cu*nts
This update is trash nobody likes it it’s confusing nobody wants to use it our views went down . Bring the old layout back
The new update is awful. You ruined a good thing.
I think I can speak for everyone when I say that the new updates are just... annoying? Please change it back to what we are familiar with, Old Snapchat. Thanks.
Horrible update
Keeps taking me back to the home screen when I get on app
My friends have slowly been using Snapchat less and insta stories more for a bit of time, but I always stayed true to Snapchat. I have been using it for at least 6 years and it is my main source of communication w my friends, but have barely used it since the update a few weeks ago. You guys really messed up on this one :/
Update: It's better now that the stories have their own separate thing. Also I never have to view the tabloids and other nonsense in what they call "discover." Well, I've discovered enough clickbait on this app and I'm virtually never using that tab anymore.
Snapchat you need to get it together... 1.8 rating? And you still haven’t changed it back.. we’re doomed.
So I was on Snapchat and i go to the right to see people's stories. All of a sudden I see Kyle Jenner's story. I don't remember adding her. Then I keep on going down and oh lord I see Black Chyna on my snap. I don't want to see her kissing her kiddos after that lame sex tape. Anyways I hate the new snap update.
This new update is horrible. Please change it back.
Please let us change our usernames even if only once a year
Don’t download the new update if you can help it.
This app is so bad. Back in 2014 it was amazing. The updates were great at first.. the filters and trophies or whatever. But now it’s SO TERRIBLE. They completely changed it.. snapchat wasn’t supposed to be made that way. I can rarely see my friend’s stories, and every time I click on buzzfeed or another big company to watch their story, it plays something else. It’s also TERRIBLE for iPhone X. I can’t do like.. anything.  I rarely rate apps but don’t download this piece of JUNK. 
After this new update, there's no saving Snapchat. Just shut it down. Sadly they can't put their pride aside and revert the changes.
It is a great and fun app! 👍😁👌
The new update is appalling. Worst design ever. 😡😡😡
What makes it worse is that the people have spoken but Snapchat is too proud to listen to its   people.
I cannot tell you how many times this app crashes. I can’t even make a cute video before the app completely shuts down. Not really user friendly. Not worth the added storage anymore.
The app is great so far it’s just that anything we post ,even from camera roll,the quality degrades.it would be great if that didn’t happen but either than that it’s great.
This use to be one of my favorite social media apps but now me and half my friends don’t use it anymore because of the terrible update
Update is terrible. Boycotting til y'all change it back. Thanks.
It was great, but now the update makes it so the stories are in the chats. That makes no sense. It could have order. Example: stories in the STORY section, and chats in the CHAT section. You shouldn’t have some stories here, some you have to swipe right for, or ones at the very bottom of the page. Rumor has it Snapchat is going back, but it better happen soon. I’m gonna delete if nothing happens in the next week.
Why is it taking so long to revert this awful update that makes the app not user friendly?
i love the app and i’m always on it but it glitches and the update is terrible😕i miss the old snapchat..keep all the special effects but the story thing gotta go
this update is not okay. you know that, we know that, jfc my grandma probably knows that. i understand it probably took a lot of money and time to develop it but honey it’s not okay. we don’t like it. i’ve found myself using the app less and less and i know people who are even going as far as to delete it because of the update. snapchat used to be my favorite app. but it’s become so hard to use lately.
With this new update they have ruined Snapchat ruined I say.
I love Snapchat I like use it every. But what I really want is the old update back it made my Snapchatting so much easier. I mean I like this update just for the features like more captions and text font but I don’t like the layout.
The new update(s) show lots of people, mostly celebrities, i have no interest in! To remove their content you have to block them, but the process to do so is so ridiculous. 1) press and hold on their story, 2) select more, 3) select “Block”, 4) confirm that you want to block the person, 5) give a reason why you want to block someone, 6) finally, select submit. Grrrrr!   Furthermore, to find something you might be interested in you have to scroll through hundreds of irrelevant stories, add a “search” field Snapchat.   Delete the app and close account! 
Update is beyond awful don’t even use it that often anymore
Last two updates have made the app slow and clunky, use to love the apps self-explanatory and easy to use layout. Used to expect my friends to use Snapchat, and it entirely replaced texting. I can no longer recommend the app, seeing as the developers managed to make it slow, hard to use, and jumbled, all for the sake of getting us to view more ads. They removed the stories tab, which also shared space with ads and promotional discovery stories, which is where Snapchat made its money. To do this, they overlapped the stories tab with the messages tab, meaning that the clean look now contains twice as many things. Additionally, stories are no longer in chronological order, making them hard to find and watch in any relevant order. To make this worse, the most recent update added two more tabs to help with the clutter the most recent update, making the jumbled yet understandable tab now broken up into three, further hindering the use of the app. All in all, trash updates please fix and I’ll remove my rating and make it a 5 star.
Constant closing of the application. Was really a fun enjoyable application until updates killed it. Just get the old Snapchat back please. This new stuff is horrendous.
Soo this is the third time i reviewed about Snapchat. It’s a awesome app. But the problem is all my streaks are deleting and that’s a problem for me so y’all need to fix it or I’m deleting the app and telling ppl that this app is horrible soo fix it now. Also my Snapchat is having these glitches and it’s really annoying so can you all please fix this.
HORRIBLE APP. ITS GODLY TERRIBLE! USED TO BE GREAT BEFORE THE NEW UPDATE BUT NOW ITS TRASH AND I HATE IT.
So recently Snapchat has changed the whole layout of its app an a lot of people dislike it. Personally I don’t like it either because it is way harder to text my friends an find their stories. Soo snapchat please go back to the old snapchat...
Like many people, I’ve gotten the new snapchat update. it’s not bad at all, some people are just too stupid to adjust to changes. Some people are too lazy to give it a chance, and it’s not fair to the people that live the update. If Snapchat got rid of the new update some people will miss it, some may not. There is a solution to this problem that snapchat is facing, If snapchat wants to solve this issue and raise they’re ratings then it would be a good idea to give people a choice. A choice if they want to keep the changes or go back to the old setup, then people that love it keep it and people that dislike it will not. Then everyone that has the app will enjoy it and most likely recommend it to many other people. Snapchat is my most favorite app to use and it pains me that people are hating on it. I love snapchat and the solution to this whole issue is simple, people just need to take action and start up the process.              -sincerely a girl that loves snapchat 
snapchat went from being great to possibly being the worst app there is. this new update is absolutely horrible. its stupid and confusing, and needs to be fixed asap. the snaps aren't in  order anymore so someone who just posted something may show up after those who already posted a while ago. it also combines the snapchats that you receive on the same page as your friends stories. whoever designed this update needs to be fired. its like they're not even paying attention to what their customers want.
I used to love connecting with friends on Snapchat, however the new update makes that hard for me causing me to dislike what I am now using. It is very hard to snap my friends without losing the streak.
Separate the stories from the messages
all of my idols i follow on snapchat dont post as much anymore. also my friends dont respond to me as much anymore. your update is trash. change it back.
The new update is the most stupidest thing ever there isn’t even a since of using it and I don’t even watch anyone’s stories anymore bc it’s all confusing they should honestly switch it.
I love Snap. It was simple and less complicated. I understand we need to update sometimes but with the new update I’m not really feeling it anymore, reason for low stars, would give it five if it wasn’t so clutter and simple like it use to be. Everything seem so jumbo and so clutter now. Some of my friends feeds aren’t even on my feeds, they are on public/discover page instead and it’s a bit frustrating/annoying. Also I don’t like that on the discover there are some people I don’t follow and I see their snap. I get it they are “famous” but if I wanted to see their feed I would follow them, if not than I don’t want to see them, plain and simple. Why fix something that wasn’t broken in the first place? Could have just tweak it a bit and do a new layout but just leave the friends/following feeds the same while the discover and chat separate (like how it was on the old layout). All these new stuff just so complicating.
Please its awful! Why ruin a good thing!!! Give us our old snapchat there was nothing wrong with it. I’ve really tried to get used to the change but i have found that I’ve been use the app less and less...
Snapchat is still wack stories are pretty much irrelevant at this point just gonna turn into another vine smh
Change it back! 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼  Also, swiping up to go to the home screen on iPhone X is a hassle, it keeps scrolling the Discovery section instead of going to the home screen. 
change it back
And the redesign is awful how do I go BACK
DO NOT USE THIS APP ITS HORRIBLE. SINCE THE NEW UPDATE IT HAS WENT DOWNHILL
They’re annoying and make the app difficult to use. Go back like 2-3 updates and leave it like that please.
I love this app. It was easy to navigate and fun to talk to friends. The new update made it a complicated mess. Usually by now I get used to an update but I’m still so lost. It’s layout is poor and it needs a different look now.
Update is poorly designed ; the way that snaps are organized is terribly confusing.
The update is awful. Sometimes you add people on snapchat that you talk to occasionally, and you don’t care about their stories. Now the people that I do care about normally don’t add to their stories so they get kicked to the bottom of the main page now. I’ve lost streaks and it’s significantly more difficult to find the people I want to hear from.
This app used to be amazing and is no horrible. I suggest it to no one.
I only have a problem with one of my saved messages with a friend. It won’t show up. All my other friends’ saved messages show up but not one particular one.
So obviously everybody seems to hate the update. IT STINKS!! I hate it, my friends complain about it, my brother and sister even agree that its a total disaster. It’s so laggy too! I would give Snapchat 5 stars if they didn’t have that update. SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME!! I NEED TO GET RID OF THIS UPDATE PLEASE!!
The new update is trash🚮🚮🚮
I loveeeee Snapchat. I use it everyday. Or at least I used to. My favorites are the ugly filters. I digress, I used it everyday up until the horrendous unneeded update. It’s not user friendly at all. I liked that there were separate sections for snapping friends and viewing stories. Now it feels mushed together.
I don’t even use the app anymore it has so many glitches and keeps crashing I hate the layout I deleted the app and tbh I’m so relieved it was so confusing and frustrating and just not fun like it used to be
The update honestly just made everything difficult and hard to see. I know you guys think people will "get over" this new update, but no. Snapchat is fun, but if it's hard to understand and not physically appealing and user-friendly, people aren't going to want to use the app..
I hate the new snap. I used to love it now I just take my pics with the filters then upload to IG. I hate this new algorithm and layout.
Bring back the old Snapchat!!
i’m writing again because i want you to know how bad your app has gotten. when we requested to have back our old snap, we meant the way it used to be not the way you have it now. it’s too difficult to watch stories. and it’s annoying when the snapchats you receive and open disappear somewhere to the bottom and you have to look for it.
Snapchat was an application I’ve used every day. The update forces you to watch things you have no interest of and makes the whole application very cluttered. So sad to see such an amazing app get ruined by an update. I think I’m going to delete it.
not like
Snapchat was an amazing app to use before this latest update. MySpace was more organized than this. I’ve tried my best to get used to this update but it is just so confusing. I don’t know why chats and stories are on the same side. It all becomes just a big mess. On the discover page it doesn’t really refresh so when I go back a few hours later it would be the same things that were on there before. I’ve never paid enough attention if that was the case beforehand but if you were to dedicate this whole page to Discover, at least refresh the tabs. Also some of my streaks are quite a distance to the bottom of the list in terms of viewing what they sent me, and usually have some stories between them. On the old update, all my streaks were there and all my chats were there and that’s all I would need to worry about when I’m on the left tab. Now I have darn near everything to do with my friends on that tab and it’s just so overwhelming. Snapchat to compliment, the bitmojis are cleaner but other than that man this update is terrible.
It was way better before and now this update is trash.
Ok so i refresh my snap and this NEW update is on my snap. At the top it’s the “Group All & Stories” and you have to slide over to choose which one you would like to pic. Yes I understand that Snapchat is trying to make it easier and more organized, but i can’t get over the fact that I have to tap on a persons name to see what they have messaged me. Like I said I know they are only trying to make it bette and easier to work, but Snapchat, pleas just go back to the old update. You are just hurting yourselves more and more. I might as well delete the app😞😞
I love the new update, much better and less complicated
This most recent update is absolute garbage. ✌🏻 Adios, Snapchat!
I mainly use this app to connect with friends since I’m not a social media junkie. That said, you guys are getting out of hand with all the mainstream content you keep rolling out. Seriously who the hell cares about what Kylie and whatever Kardashian are doing? Some people like myself do not care about them, but they are literally being portrayed all over the app every time I log in to Snapchat. I think this is really getting out of hand and I feel that it is deteriorating what Snapchat was originally about. Sadly this app becoming to be like the DailyNews app (which is promoted all over this app) where it is only concerned about celebrity life. Well here’s a news flash, not all of us care about celebrities. Tbh I’m way more concerned about my own personal life rather than worrying what Kim or Jenner wore last night at a night club. You’re failing on me Snapchat🤦🏻‍♂️
I enjoy Snapchat, however, with this latest update it is awful. The feed is confusing and hard to navigate. The app is constantly freezing. Stop trying to add so much stuff to it. Don’t fix what isn’t broken, plenty of people enjoyed it just the way it was.
i used to love snapchat and now it’s just confusing. none of my snaps are chronological and the app crashes all the time. it’s hard to find people’s stories and i can’t see private stories unless i search for them. please fix it i’m about to delete it, it’s so frustrating.
So bad 🤦🏾‍♂️
I used to love this app. And I still do. Just not nearly as much. Since you changed the layout, it’s hard to find everything and honestly it’s just stupid.
The new update attempts to make it more clear between friends, stories, and groups. However it’s simply still extremely cluttered. It was perfect before. Don’t fix what isn’t broken.
I hate the update. It’s unnecessary.
It used to be good the new update is horrible
My Snapchat has been really slow and it keeps logging me off of it. Every time I go on it says I have no snaps. It constantly takes forever to load when I try to take pictures and videos
Thanks for the useless update we didnt ask for ! Go back to the old version -.-
Cannot recommend this app as it is right now. Snapchat used to have a clean, streamlined interface, but now it seems every update they find a way to add unnecessary complications. That in itself isn’t even that big of a dealbreaker for me. If an update makes the app worse, I won’t update. Unfortunately, Snapchat updates itself. It appears that nobody at Snap. Inc has used a phone, or their app once in their life. Who thought this update was a good idea? Nobody with eyes, that’s for sure.  Use WhatsApp or something instead. 
I used to love using snapchat and use it all the time. It was very neat and a great social tool. Then the new update came out and I have to say it completely ruined everything. It’s super hard to find the simplest things and it takes so much work to find anything. Everything is cluttered and so close together. Not to mention it crashes my phone constantly throughout the day (I have an iPhone 7). The cons far outweigh the pros and for this reason I have found myself almost never using Snapchat which used to be an app I used to love and rely on. A major letdown hands down.
New update = absolute crap. It’s like having an iPhone, breaking it, and having to replace it with a galaxy. It’s been a few weeks and I still have trouble navigating through the app. Garbage.
Horrible
I’ve accepted the sad fact that snapchat is not turning back to its old layout. I’m okay with them putting private stories on one page, but PLEASE bring back select/select all stories to watch instead of clicking each one individually!!!
Okay, so I've been having problems a lot lately with Snapchat, and my friends have been experiencing the same problems. Snapchat is probably not even going to read this review, but, PLEASE FIX THIS. It says that I'm not connected to the internet when I clearly am and my other apps would be working fine. This happened to me maybe once before the update, now it's constantly. Snapchat is the social media platform I use the most, and it's breaking my heard the trouble I'm seeing everyone have with it.
This app was fantastic until this new update. Everything is smaller and on one page, making it look very unorganized and has so much wasted space. The stories are also on one page with the chats which makes it very confusing since the people I recently texted aren’t there half the time; instead, it’s people who recently posted on their story. Keep in mind I don’t ever watch stories so this is very inconvenient. Many people are upset with this update as anyone can tell by the major rating change for this app. Please fix this, snapchat. Everyone would appreciate it
No one gets on here anymore after that stupid update
Honestly Busch did 9/11 and theres no way he has the balls for this update. Id rather see michale phelps drown than have to keep using this update. Shaun white did not cut his hair this. Even jews would pick hitler over this. Jew all should chamber it back to normal, it just burns to know the snapchat turned to assh.
This issue is something nobody even cares to bring up. I love snapchat, always have, it is my favorite app! Being a social app i want to have MORE people add me and get MORE friends and views but how am i suppose to do that when I’m embarrassed of my username? I created it when i was young and now as a teen I’m not comfortable with it as it isn’t even my name and i want it to be. There is no way to change your username! I’m BEGGING YOU to make this update! Considering a lot of people who use this app are pre teens and teens it quite likely there are many others who have this problem . I would have had so many more opportunities and experiences with this app if only it included this feature. PLEASE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I hate the new update to the Snapchat app! It has significantly decreased the number of views I get, which ultimately effects my business because I put a lot of promotions on there. You should give us an option on if we want to update it. This is HORRIBLE! Most of my friends agree.
I luv it
YOU HAVE SOMEHOW MANAGED TO MAKE THE, ALREADY HORRIBLE UPDATE, EVEN WORSE! IT'S EVEN HARDER TO FIND MESSAGES NOW THAN IT WAS BEFORE! WHAT'S THE POINT OF THE "STORIES" AND "ALL" TABS IF IT STILL DOESN'T SEPARATE MESSAGES FROM STORIES! JUST BRING ORIGINAL SNAPCHAT BACK! IT WASN'T BROKEN, SO WHY TRY TO FIX IT?!
So I’m trying to do this thing where you post your first Snapchat selfie and your latest selfie. Snapchat wasn’t working so I got off of it and tried again. It shut me out😑😤 I tried again and went to my pics. Everything. Was. Gone. I’m soooo mad because I had very important stuff on there. And then again, if this update doesnt change snap back to what it was I’m going to be suuuuuuuuuper mad. Thanks for listening. Bye.
So this has nothing to do with the update bc I already know Snapchat is solving this, but I have a recommendation Snapchat should add a live Feature and I feel like they’d get a lot of great feed back.   1: Snapchat is one of the biggest social media apps out there people are basically on it the most and as to what I can tell more people use it more that Instagram, Facebook and etc. and with that I feel like with more people on that more people that will join lives and Imagine seeing your favorite stars live on your most used app. Also when I use other apps to go live it’s hard to branch out to my friends to see but Snapchat would be a great platform to use for this feature. I really hope the snap team takes this into consideration👍🏼‼️
Completely made the app a jumbled mess, we want stuff separated, not mashed all into one screen. There is no way to keep track of who you added and if they added you back, unrealistically having to go through multiple screens for each and every person. The collage of stories in the right tab is a gigantic waste of space, and in no way did we need a bigger thumbnail to see what the story was gonna be about. Oh more random advertising in the right tab, must have been on everyone’s Snapchat feature requests. Cut your losses and roll it back, can at least save face and admit you lost the vision of the users.
The new update is bad now my Snapchat messes up every second and all my streeKs have timers , I snap them back and they snap me timer still there Over and over every day!!
Why is there not a “0” star?
The last update is simply horrendous!!!
I’ve had snapchat since it came out years ago. Snapchat has always been good at listening to its customers but they really ruined it with this new update. Furthermore they refuse to do anything about it despite the constant complains. For this reason along with the fact that I don’t know how to use it anymore I am disconnecting and moving on to other social media platforms. You’ve been good to us snapchat but you stopped listening to your customers and that’s what killed the app.
Ever since the update I’ve been running into continuous problems. Now the app keeps crashing this needs to be fixed.
I highly don't recommend this app anymore because of the update it's too confusing and has stories and chats on one page. Apps are recognized for their originality and format which they have now changed. It is ruined now and I highly don't recommend it. The update was unnecessary and uncalled for. I hope they can compromise and at least make stories and chat on two separate pages because this so confusing. Apps are recognized for their originality and they have now changed that. I find myself barely on it anymore.
On top of everything else, it takes so long to load the snaps from people’s story
Do an update for iPhone X
Now if there’s anyone who hasn’t S17E5 of South Park, go watch. But if you have then you probably know just like I do, there’s some upset Snapchat executive that approved this update and feels exactly like Mr. Mackey. You dropped the ball sir. My iPhone X and iPhone 8 Plus, which are more than capable of running this app. Freeze. Always. If you guys haven’t realized there’s only so much Snapchat can do on mobile devices before it doesn’t work correctly. Go back to your old ways and focus on augmented features. The UI was perfectly fine. SNAPCHAT should be simple to use and simple to post, and have killer camera features. Pat yourself on the back for the current update. Just kidding don’t. You’re fired.
After the update, I don’t open Snapchat as much anymore. Also, I updated it to get the fonts, but they’re not even there. Snapchat needs to get it together; the layout is terrible and “chunky”, as if it was just thrown together. The only reason I still use it is because of its faster than instagram in messaging, but Instagram is about blogging and Snap is about messaging. Snapchat isn’t even good at what it’s supposed to do anymore. And everything is up to date.
I updated but there shows no change, I can’t add multiple captions or change the fonts??
This new update is horrible! I demand the old version
Im missing the old Snapchat. I wish you guys can bring it back already!
You guys need to change Snapchat back how it was it is very annoying 😕
I hate the new update snap was a solid 10 now it’s a 2 I like the font and the more text boxes but girl the way it’s setup ummmmmm no thanks
Since the new update i can’t open my Snapchat, it just keeps crashing... any way to bring back the old version?
We all wanted the old snap and they found a way to not only ignore us and make a worse one 1/10
New update ruined Snapchat
This new update just makes everything more and more confusing. Why change something that was already good. Also, can you please make an option where you can unsave chats that other people save.
your losing money and happy customers with this new Snapchat update ! please bring back the old Snapchat
Change it back!!!
PUT THE STORYS BACK ON THE OTHER PAGE
Change it back
Update is really horrible , I hate the layout ! Very disappointed wish they would bring back the old one. Whoever made the new layout should be fired.
Now it’s absolute trash. There was NO description about the update before it updated. It’s cluttered. Confusing. Annoying. GLITCHY AF. seriously, please change the layout back to how it was...
YOU GUYS KEEP MAKING IT WORST AND WORST PLS STOP
Change it back to the new update literally no one likes its, I don’t even wanna be on Snapchat anymore
😓
Why’d they ruin there own app. I don’t understand why companies do this. If you have a product that works and that people don’t change it. By all means improve upon things, and fix problems but don’t completely change the interface of your app. It’s just stupid!
The new layout is so unbelievably bad. Whoever thought it was a good idea needs to be fired immediately.
i loves Snapchat so much and used everyday and now it isn’t the same at all and rlly hard to navigate. Snapchat is getting hate for the update so why won’t y’all just go back it will be the best for all of us. the only thing good about the update is the Bitmoji and stickers. very disappointed :(
Why update it to this and not change it back ? LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE!!!
I have loved and used Snapchat for years. I have always loved everything about his app until they released this just absolutely awful update. This. Update. Is. Absolute. Trash. Everything is too cluttered and confusing, friends don’t stay in order of which you snapped last, sometimes the “read” icon doesn’t even show up, I hate having to click all the way to the left to view stories, I hate the new layout of selecting which users to snap, I HATE how they took stories out of its own spot with the advertisements, etc. I could go on and on. There is not one person I know that likes the update.  Snapchat, please bring back the old layout. Your users are will love you guys so much. We appreciate the fact that you want to make it easier for the users but honestly the old layout was the best! You could literally bring back the old layout and everything would be perfect. 
My Snapchat keep crashing 😐
Now the update has completely destroyed usability for me. Interacting with friends is 100% harder than it needs to be and sometimes I miss when my friends are trying to talk to me even though they just replied. I'd give it 0 stars if I could.
I’ve had snapchat for YEARS. New updates have always been welcome. The latest update however is the biggest jumbled up mess that snapchat has ever released. There is zero organization in the new layout that makes absolutely no sense. Until snapchat released a new update that once again changes the layout, this will no longer be an app taking up storage on my phone as it is a waste of space.
Not a fan of the new update. It’s too cluttered. It’s annoying having to go to 3 different places, 1 for public snaps another for your friends snaps which are mixed in with your private convos and then going somewhere else to see who’s viewed your snaps. It’s just too messy. I very rarely use the app now.
I love snapchat until it updated...
never really use snap anymore. terrible app
Your update is fine the only part I absolutely hate it the whole story situation, it is the worst thing ever I hate it and so much other people do to so just do everyone a favor and fix it. Thanks.
update = trash
I love this app but just change the app
Time to get rid of snap and just use insta stories ... Sorry Snapchat, you asked for it...
Please go back to the old Snapchat layout. Please.
Can you please change the format of snapchat back to how it use to be. I hate this new look.
The new update totally changed my opinion about snapchat. I hate it. All streaks used to be at the top but now stories will randomly refresh and mess up your messages. Please go back to the previous snapchat
zeft zeft zeft
This update is poison.
Bad update
Latest update is by far the worst. instead of making things easier and simpler it just seems more complicated and really cluttered. seems like you guys just threw everything onto one side. please go back to the old snapchat.
The new update is so horrible that I only log into snapchat once everyday to keep my streak going. It’s so confusing and makes using the app so much of a hassle. Most users like me only care about their friends stories and not some whack celebrity snapchat stories and Snapchat channels. I know snapchat won’t bring back the old update but for people who want to use this app believe me you’re better of using Instagram stories and Facebook.
I used to like SnapChat until it updated🤦🏽‍♀️
This update is really bad I don’t like it no one likes it change it to the old Snapchat i am going to delete the app rip Snapchat
BRING DA OLD SNAP BACK
Who’s idea was this now don’t wanna use the app because it hard to use, unorganized, and you can easily make a mistake about who you wanna watch they better turn this around cuz Instagram about to be the move all these years I get change is good but this a whole different app or give people the option for their layout old or new
Overall garbage.
The entire app has just failed after the update. App freezes, force closes, takes forever to switch from camera mode to the feed or messages or the snap roll. The messages are a mess because now it has people I don’t even communicate with in the section to force me to watch there snap story..Can’t even get rid of them it’s just severely annoying now. Going to delete the app all together with. So many people have complained and its still a terrible update
I have selected “see less like this” to the Pyeongchang Olympic stories about once an hour for the last week+.  Don’t make it an option if you can’t do it!  Everyday I hope someone makes an app that works like Snapchat but w/o all the BS...
Horrible. Snapchat used to be great before the update. Snapchat doesn’t care about its users they see how much everyone hates the app and still continue with these terrible updates that the people do not want and hate. Just trying to get every penny they can. Soon snapchat will be like MySpace and fade off because no one likes using it anymore.
Boo its very bad
Update is terrible and they keep making it worse please stop
trash
I used to be a huge fan of snapchat... However, this new snapchat update is so inconvenient and annoying. I already deleted the app because it’s just so inefficient.
I love Snapchat. I've been using it for a while now. I just, oml, I hAtE the update dkdkdkskd
The new update came with a different layout that made everything much harder to use and see.
BRING BACK THE BUTTERFLY FILTER AND THE OLD STORIES!!!
This update really made everything confusing. I don’t even like opening snap chat because it makes little to no sense anymore. Kylie even hates it now... KYLIE.
we all hate the new update. change it back omg the new one is so confusingggggg
The update is terrible and Snapchat use to be good, and there is now a new update to the update and it’s also bad so please stop trying and just bring back Snapchat. The app literally has 1.8 stars because the update is terrible. I might even stop using snap
The latest update keeps crashing and my snaps disappear !! Why are you doing this ????
I was a frequent user of snapchat and was a fan of its format and then a new update was released. Everybody was saying how bad it was so I didn’t update it. About 4 days after the release it updates automatically and after 3 days of using the new Snapchat, I have deleted the app and frankly I don’t even miss it
This new up date is so bad. I use to use Snapchat all the time and only follow the people I want to follow and see celebrities that I watched to see. But now I see everyone’s stories and that’s just stupid. Even if Snapchat went back to the old lay out, I think that they already have done enough damage to this app that no one would use it after this stupid update. Deleting this app and just going to start doing IG stories.
Change Snapchat back to how it originally was or I’m going to delete it like in maybe a month from now
Change it back how it was it wasn’t broken, now I have look @all these stories, I have to tap on them I push I wanna see less of them.. Change back PLEASE..
Needs a new update, keeps shutting and freezing me out when I try and edit my snapchats
NO ONE likes this new update please please pleaseee bring back the update before this new one because i don’t even want to use the app anymore. it’s too complicated. like it’s an absolute joke and if you can please let us change our usernames that’d be cool bc we made that in middle school and that ain’t far 🤣 #bringbackwhatthe2000’skidsremember
I like Snapchat but hate the update.
i’ve had this update for a couple of weeks and i cant help but notice how difficult it is...i understand it’s supposed to make the app easier to use but it only made it hard to use. please consider going back to the old format or something similar
Hate hate hate and it keeps getting worse. They keep adding features to make it more clustered. Please change it back.
So! I’m sure you guys have heard it all before !! But to have the old Snapchat set up would be way better & appreciated if that could happen!
I have had Snapchat for two years now and I honestly think it one of the best apps on my phone I use it the most and it’s the best way for me to contact people. The new update a lot of people like but they just haven’t gotten use to it yet now I have and I like how the bitmoji is on the side or there story. Some things were allotted confusing at first but now there are perfect I definitely recommend this app to anyone.
Maybe for the next update you can add a flitter file. Where the user can have the option to save their favorite filters instead of them going away or having to scroll.  It would be easier and make many happier.  ~SnapUser 
Pleaseeee go back to the old Snapchat!!!!
Y'all just killed your app. Good job! It's too cluttered. Whoever came up with this idea should be fired. Why are there other people's stories on the "Discover" page who I don't follow? I'm ready to quit Snapchat & switch to Instagram Stories.
I used to love how even if someone snapped me I could slide the screen over & peak at there message if I didn’t want them to know I had seen it, now I’m forced to click on it if I want to know what a snap says! Every time I go to message one of my friends I accidentally slide it over to stories only & lose them & it’s just really confusing. I don’t like that everyone can’t view my story as it’s posted either unless they are having a conversation with me. The old version was better.
Snap chat was amazing until it updated
okay i love snapchat and all, but i’ve updated it and i still can’t access the new font! i’ve deleted snapchat, logged back in and it still wasn’t there. i would love some help on this!
I used to love Snapchat and it was my favorite app but after the new update I like Instagram better now. It's too cluttered I can't find anybody's Snapchat stories . Since people can't find anyone's stories my views have decreased. Would not recommend unless you just want the filters !
The new update is so horrible.
I hate you.
They ruined it
I gave Snapchat one star because of the new update.  I have been using this app for years now and it is probably one of my most used apps on my phone, however with the new update I hate using it now. There are some great new features but it has made the app harder to use. It is harder to find people’s stories and I feel like it is very complicated to snap people back because snaps I open get sent to the bottom and ones I haven’t are at the top. I feel like Snapchat should keep some of the new things they added but the shout put all the stories back on one page. Over all they should really look at what their users are saying, take their input into consideration, and fix the app. 
Just plain fun...
Snapchat's new update is the biggest fail of 2018
The update is trash needs to go back to the original app but leave the multiple fonts update and the ability to write multiple scripts update on there as well also the app should stop taking up so much battery power . And the app needs to get a glitch test run because it's forever glitching
Honestly, before this recent major update, Snapchat would have received 4-5 stars. This new update completely ruins Snapchat. It's cluttered, near impossible to see all the stories properly, it's very easy to lose streaks since they no longer keep your recent snaps up top, it's just a mess.  Pull yourself together, Snapchat. 
IM SO DISAPPOINTED IN YOU SNAPCHAT, ITS 2018 DO BETTER QUEEN
Snapchat will become the MySpace of Facebook  After (classified name) is released 
Bring back the old snapchat
I used to LOVE Snapchat and I still do . But I’m pretty sure all my friends and family can agree to that I can’t stand the update . iTS confusing and annoying 🤷🏾‍♀️💯
Celebrity stories start from the very beginning even though they’ve already been viewed. Good job on the update 🙄
I like how you heard the criticism for the Snapchat story. I think you are you try to fix a failed. It’s become a bit hard to click on a snap without it switching into a different tab. I don’t have any idea on how to fix it but if I do I will edit this. But only 32 people in group chat is still too small of a number.
1. Starting about today or yesterday (today’s the 24th), I have hardly been getting notifications when someone snapchats me. I don’t get an actual notification or the red number by the app; it only recognizes that someone snapped me if I open the app and refresh the snaps page (obviously very annoying if I’m waiting for someone to snap me back or if someone snaps me asking a question requiring a quick response) 2. With the update, if I type text on my Snapchat picture to send to someone, and I want to drag it somewhere else on the image (don’t want it to cover my face, etc), it is now too easy to accidentally delete your whole message. I’m right handed so I tend to move the text with my right thumb, and if you drag the text too close to the right side of the screen near the trash can icon, it will delete the whole text, and there’s no undo option. Annoying. 
I love Snapchat don’t get me wrong. It’s my main social media app. I take basically all my pictures on it. But this update is horrible. Everyone I know hates it. Please change is back! Thank you.
I used to love using Snapchat but now I can’t change my phone number in settings, the interface is difficult to use, and now the word “chat” is at the bottom of personal snaps so when you screenshot that shows up on the pic. 1/10 do not recommend.
if i could give the app zero stars now i would. i want the stories of my friends on the right and the snaps on the left. few people care about about your awful mass media content. i don’t feel like falling into the trap of following the masses every time i swipe right. i’m sorry but the new interface is awful, and it’s making me want to quit snapchat outright.
The new update pretty much ruined Snapchat for me, I’m deleting this a going back to android smh
No one like it expected you. I don’t like it because I like my STORIES and TEXT MESSAGES SEPARATED!!!!and then the subscriptions are ridiculous I don’t like random people  snap. I like it when they were TINY and you can swiped to see what u want to see.... If I WANT ONE CHANGE it would be the stories and text messages SEPARATED that’s all I ask PLEASEEEE !!!!
I am giving this a 4 star because it is not a social media, it is a ghost finder! If you look at Jake new’s YouTube account or jakeAG4’s twitter account then you can see that your app caught a ghost!
I did use the app every day but since the updates changed everything around I don’t care for the app at all
This is bull$h1t
I dont like this new update where all the people u follow or who follows you is all mixed up inbthe developers section so frustrating we literally have to search for the person u want to see what they have posted. Please fix this.
Pleas put my snapchats in order and when I write someone a message please keep it at the top I should not have to scroll to find my messages I have too many friends 🙄 Get it together with this update it is just sloppy makes me want to delete snap chat
This update is very complicated and everything feels so cluttered. I think it was way better before this update because everything was more organized and spaced out.
I used to use snapchat a lot more than I do now, the update is awful and the majority of people hate it, and it updated out of nowhere
Trash.
The update is making me leave Snapchat. I hate how messy and unorganized it is and every time I open someones snap it disappears and doesn’t show up at the top anymore . I don’t like how people bitmojis are next to their name . It looks stupid and it’s confusing . My Snapchat updated with automatic updates off forcing me to have it . If I didn’t want to download it don’t force it . It’s a choice . Second, most of my friends have public stories and they are mixed in with celebs which annoys me to have everyone’s story there. Please go back to old version and maybe your ratings will be better . But for now I’m leaving snap.
Snapchat i am so done with you, i used this app for two reasons and you went and messed them both up.  For starters i no longer even know how to watch my friends stories which is the best part of this app staying connected with friends.  The second reason i really liked your app is because of the daily stories such as daily mail and people magazine. I can no longer find those either because the SNAPCHAT TEAM decided it would be cool to fill that space with people who ARENT EVEN YOUR FRIEND ON SNAPCHAT so while I’m trying to find the stories and things i actually do care about I’m forced to scroll through HUNDREDS of peoples stories that i literally do not care about 🤷🏼‍♀️ why would i wanna see a bunch of stories of people i usually don’t even know.  🤩🤩🤩 bonus Snapchat f*** up they have made it so if you slide on a message it takes you to a different page with all your actual friends and groups just split up three ways so you now have to actually click on the message to see it so you can no longer slide over on a message and read some of it without actually opening the message which is so annoying.  Bottom line FIX IT YOU ARE MAKING IT WORSE!!!!!! 
The new update is so bad. I have to communicate through hand written letters. Do not buy this app, it is a waste of time and will only make you sad.
This update makes it hard to easily access your friends list. I can’t do the pretty fonts with the new update.
MAKE SNAP CHAT ITS OLD SELF
This app doesn’t let me use the new update
I never even use this app anymore after the stupid update😤
The new update is terrible and after weeks of trying to get used it to it, it just isn't fun anymore. I hate that the celebrity list is separated from my friends list and more than anything I hate my friends list is all in my messages.
Ok Snapchat congratulations!!!! You honestly made the worst update of all time WORSE!!!!😒 stop tying and go back to the old version.
I used snap to talk to my friends for over a year but after the new update it moves everyone that I talk to the bottom it’s super annoying scrolling all the way down to find my friends
Go back.
Plz bring back Snapchat how it was, ty.
Snapchats update was a huge screw you to their users. It made it far easier to advertise, but far harder to use. I hope a competitor emerges so I don't have to deal with them being greedy in the future.
Undo this last terrible update. Not everyone wants to see the dumb discover stories, and stories should be completely separate from individual snaps! Come on. If it isn’t broke, don’t fix it.
I used to love Snapchat but I feel like I have to look for people when I want to see their snaps and it’s all out of order makes me not even want to view stories anymore and I’m sure many others feel the same way considering everyone’s views have been way less than what they used to be before the new update. Please change it back to the way it was because clearly no one likes this new update.
It keeps getting worse and worse.. BRING BACK THE OLD UPDATE!
Just revert to the old Snapchat before the update
If it’s not broke, don’t fix it!! Bring back the old Snapchat!!
The new Snapchat update has literally become the worst update in Snapchat history, I hate it and so many of my friends hate it to. It’s horrible.
I don’t understand why Snapchat won’t fix the problem. Change it back.
Terrible.  Please revert back. For all the other reasons that many other people have listed.  We all love Snap & we all hate the new update.  Thanks 
The update causes me to log out of my account to log back into it just to verify I didn’t lose streaks because random timers show up when I snapped the person and they snapped back.
This new update is just awful. The company isn't listening to the community when the majority of us would like for the company to revert back to its previous version. Would not recommend.
I don’t hate the new update, but seriously don’t enjoy it. I can use the app but it doesn’t look good. It feels cluttered, as if the update was done without thought. I’m all for upgrades and improvements, but Snapchat missed the mark big time.
change it back
This update has everyone upset and makes people not want to use the app
this new update could not be worse
Take a long hard look in the mirror. You have completely trashed you’re company and being hardheaded for not changing it
Might as well be called slowchat now. I hate this app so much which is sad because I used to be obsessed. Along with everyone else I think this update is horrible. I can’t even take a video without it freezing the whole time or it just has no audio and lags. I also don’t care for the set up and how celebrities I follow don’t show up on my story board and the celebs I don’t care about who up automatically. I will be headed over to instagram if you need me. ✌🏼
The update is horrible. I can’t even keep up with my friends snap. All I see is a bunch of celebrities snap that I don’t even follow or care to even watch. It’s ridiculous! Until snapchat goes back to old update, I will no longer use it. Instagram has all my attention now. Deleting app after i write this! I wish I could rate it zero star 🙄🖕🏼
just go back to the old platform......
the new update is even worse my guy ..
For starters, I don’t have my apps set for automatic update and for This most recent update it just went and did it for me like so many others. On top of that the visual is just terrible, it’s really inconvenient to watch my friends stories now so I just usually don’t. Honestly the only reason I use it now is to keep my streaks alive 
3 words to describe this 1 star review. UPDATE IS AWFUL   Why would you change a perfectly good platform to something that people hate. It makes me happy to see your reviews have gone to 1.8 stars because you deserve it. MAKE A CHANGE!!!! 
I’m sure who decided to change everything with this app. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.  The arbitrary layout and order of snaps is the most infuriating thing. What happened to chronological order? THAT made sense! It’s seems they just wanted more money from the advertising and the stupid “discover” areas. I’m over it. 
It was better before they should’ve never move things please fix Or give a options were it goes back
The update is such a mess
i used to love snapchat because it was super easy to use, but the update made everything super complicated. i don’t even know how to make a story now
What were you guys thinking? Do you think we are like sheep and will follow your disastrous UI lead and persuasive CEO’s statement that we will learn to like it or that the app will get smarter and learn the way we use it. 😂☑️  Truly you guys think... we don’t realize that you integrated all of the stories from our friends with the paid advertisers stories in an futile attempt to get us to click on your adverts more frequently? Does it make me feel closer to celebrities? No. If you don’t stop trying so hard to please your advertisers and instead start trying to please your customers user base you will go the way of the MySpace. 
Ever hear the saying if it ain't broke don't fix it? This update is awful. The layout is terrible. I don't mind discover, if they would have left the app the same just added one more swipe for discover it'd be perfect. But they complicated it without need. Very disappointed, definitely won't be using it as much as before.
The update still too bad 😭😭😭😭👎💔
They just ruined the layout of the friends list and stories... just to make a tab dedicated to ads. Terrible layout for an app.
This new update is really bad. Bad design, bad navigation.
i used to love sc and get on everyday but the update made it awful it's cluttered and annoying and it almost made me delete the app
Many people use this app to send “streaks” to their friends or acquaintances, as well as to view stories. Recently, this has become hard for those types of people including myself because the layout is very poor. It is hard to view people’s stories and to open all snaps that were sent to you. I would not recommend now downloading this app due to its poor layout.
Give us back the old update
My Snapchat maps aren’t working
No. Just no.
Ok so instead of changing the whole set up of snapchat, why don't you let us change usernames, tell us when streaks are going to end, and stuff like that. Not change everything that everyone used to love.
Stupid update
If this was a physical device you’d have more returns than Samsung. You guys have success turned Snapchat into trash. Nearly bad enough to return to MySpace.
Bad. Go back to the old update.
Trash tier viersion of this app
New update gets a lot of hate but I like it
Hate all the updates we've been recently getting, i dont know why they changed it in the first place
I wrote a review about the new update saying I hated it, but now that I’m used to it, I actually really like it. I love the font changes and the multiple texts I’m still trying to get over the stories and chats in the same place but plz don’t change it I really like it
Y’all need to fix this dam update back
Great app but I hate the new update
Fix it.
To be honest I loved Snapchat I have been using this app for a couple years now but with the new updates it's just ruining the app it's self i likes it the way it was please change it back
Snapchat use to be cool, now the new update is horrible.
WHY CANT SNAP JUST LISTEN TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO HAS THE APP AND CHANGE IT BACK NO ONE IS GONNA JUDGE JUST GO BACK ITS SO SO SO BAD I HAVENT USED IT IN SO LONG JUST CHANGE IT BACK
Snapchat used to be my favorite app but after that horrible update I deleted that in less then a minute! I hate so much ! Bring back the Snapchat I use to know! 😡😡😡😡😪😪😪😪
Today, after relearning how to use the app after the horribly cluttered update, I attempted to post a story for a brand I was partnering with. After tediously editing videos originally taken on Snapchat for hours, I reuploaded them only to find the quality had been purposely diminished. Then, after re-editing within the app and posting to my story in the order I wanted them in, SC reordered the videos/pictures into the order they were taken. I will now be using Instagram stories to post the content because trying to manipulate this app is a ridiculous waste of time. Not only did it waste my time, but the quality of my content was compromised & I had to sacrifice key elements of my original vision just to get it to somewhat work. No thanks. Not the app for me anymore
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE GIVE THE OPTION TO PUT THINGS IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER IT TAKES ME FOREVER TO FIND THINGS
Why haven’t you fixed this? Nobody likes it. Instead f making minor improvements, maybe try fixing it.
As a longtime faithful snapchatter, I speak for the rest of us because we are disappointed with the new update. It’s really hard to find people’s stories and nobody wants to go out of their way to find someone’s story or find the chat they just sent.
HATEEEEEEEE the new update! Make things simple again and less complicated again please. This update is really annoying
This is the end of the application of SnapChat because of this update has left a large number of users to use this application because of the many problems and design complex complex, start this application faded, I expect that if no changes will fade this application little by little as other applications that ended and Avlst companies, Goodbye SnapChat 
New update is extremely cluttered and messy. Why fix something that isn’t broken?
Until they change the new update you mind as well not get it 🙄🙄🙄
Ugliest thing I've ever seen snapchat do. The bitmojis on the side make me want to delete bitmojis and just cry it's so ugly and jumbled. I don't want "revisions", and instead of giving us what you think you want please listen to your users. We just want t back to what it was before the update. The discovery page is also stupid I can never find what article I want to read and I see all these stupid public stories from famous people I do not care about whatsoever. The stories are absolutely awful and I am forced to look through old stories if I want to get rid of the stupid circles around the bitmojis. Also, with the redbox so small I cannot tell who wants to snap and who just added to their story. I'll look at them if I want to and now you just AHVE me flipping through them without even looking, causing the purpose of bringing people together to just be thrown out the window. Please enjoy your reduced paychecks until you  give us what we want.
I love snapchat but I didn’t really like the update at first but it grows on you. I think you just have to get used to it. I honestly live snapchat so much❤️
Snapchat is trash now and it’s been about an couple weeks with new update and since I think the majority of people hate this new update and stop using Snapchat including myself, hear the people out because at the end of the day you will be loosing money and tons of customers. If you reverse this update I think the majority of people will be extremely happy including myself until then FIX IT!!!!
I would give the new update 0 stars if I could. They made viewing stories very complicated and it demotivates me and probably everyone else to open a story. Viewing streaks is now complicated, they made the number and emoji smaller and harder to see. Very annoying to look at subscribed stories. Overall, I’m probably going to be using instagram stories from now on.
So I updated my snap 3 days ago and in the caption it said “Different text styles” but even tho I updated Snapchat it still hasn't given me  The different styles! Please help 
FIX THIS AWFUL UPDATE YOU CANT FIND ANYTHING
This application has been changed to a much less convenient outlet of media. It causes a less effective user friendly form of conversation. The screen display of the homepage is irritating, cluttered and chaotic. The reason why it is so hard to view stories is because is on the same side as the conversations. This is the whole reason why we use Snapchat, is to mainly converse with others and view stories. When you combine the two to one page it becomes unorganized and hard to do one or the other. Change it back!
I absolutely hate this new update, I miss the old Snapchat 😢
My phone updated the new update with the different fonts and stuff automatically. It did that last night. I took a picture today and it wasn't there. I looked in the App Store and it said that there was no new update available today and it also said that it updated yesterday.
Please change snap chat to how it was prior to the horrible update. It’s so confusing!!
Please reverse the update!! Nobody likes it..
The update really messed everything up. Why would you take a perfect product and ruin it.
How about you guys fix bugs instead of making the app look more complicated and terrible to use? Streak bugs are irritable, and the update makes me even more irritated.
Snapchat looks to be going the way of YikYak with this new update. Terrible update, and completely unresponsive/out of touch corporate folks essentially saying publicly that they don’t care what the users think. Reached to high and are now falling on their faces. Bye bye.
you said it would change back to the original before the big update but you never changed it back and i’m mad everyone’s not using it so that’s bad for you lol
The new update is TERRIBLE it’s so ugly and cluttered. Deserves 0 stars and Snapchat won’t remove it.
Want to go back to see someone’s story again. What happened to that?
This really used to be my favorite app until they did that stupid update. I barely even use this anyone because that update is so ugly and confusing. I can’t even communicate with people any more because it’s too confusing!!! I don’t know why you guys thought this was a smart thing to do.
Its been however long since the day of the update. Still as bad as the first day. Slowly losing my mind and my balls. I will keep you updated. Pray for me
Snapchat was a great easy app to use to show someone what you are doing during the day. The update ruined it. No organization at all. Just a huge cluster.
The update is not great! Love the new fonts and things like that but what is it going to take to put the layout back! This new this is unnecessary difficult and unpleasant to use! Begging to change back immediately.
I’m done. Your new layout after all the complaining is the same!!! I don’t want stories and chats to be together!!!! Uninstalled.
Change back
You need to change the Snapchat update to how it was before
I HATE THIS NEW UPDATE AND EVERYONE ELSE DOES PLEASE GO BACK TO THE OLD SNAPCHAT
This update is so cluttered and unnecessary. I don’t even use the app as much as I used too. It’s harder to use for no reason & social media shouldn’t be complicated at all. This update makes the app horrible. Sorry not Sorry...
This update is absolute trash I used to use Snapchat everyday but now it’s trash. This update is the worst thing than any app has ever done ever you guys are such sellouts so you can promote famous people. Also when I tried to hide the steroids of the garbage people I just got more garbage people. The developers should feel ashamed of themselves for taking on of the best apps on the market and making it complete and utter trash.
It’s disappointing that Snapchat refuses to listen to their users. I refuse to use Snapchat now.
This update stinks, enough said. Bring back the old version of snap that we all know and love.
HATE HATE HATE HATE THE NEW UPDATE!!!! SNAPCHAT PLEASE GO BACK WHEN SNAPCHAT WAS A LOT MORE SIMPLE!!!! YOUR STUPID NEW UPDATE IS JUST FOR ADVERTISEMENT!!! LIKE COME ON!!! YOU'RE BETTER THAN THIS!!
Snapchat You Definitely took a Major Loss With This Compiled format , it’s extremely eye irritating , Less people watch cause they don’t like scrolling constantly to find your story . The Must Change Detail most of all tho is DEFINITELY the Discover page . Please fix this Snapchat or I’m putting you guys on hiatus.
When the new Snapchat update came out and everyone was mad about it, I was one of the first people to have it. I did not like it at first but now I am starting to enjoy it. Soon after the update (when everyone had the, “bad” update) a new update about fonts starting showing up on all my friend’s Snapchats. I REALLY wanted the new update but it never showed up... I updated Snapchat so the new updates say things like, “new fonts” and, “multiple text on a picture”. IT DOES NOT SHOW! I have deleted the app and reinstalled, Powered off my iPhone, reset my iPhone, and logged in and out. I even went into settings and checked out the keyboard and Snapchat stuff, nothing. All my friends have this update and I feel like I’m glitched in the middle... does anyone else have this experience?
Horrible !!
was a great app but now media is shoved in my face and new update is annoying and un familiar also clustered
Hate the update it\'s horrible
Just can we get the old set up back please no even cares about the stories anymore cause of this
I’m not big on writing reviews but after being a HEAVY Snapchat user for quite some time now, I find this “new update” to be very disappointing. Speaking from a avid consumer standpoint I hope that the Snapchat team is taking the time to read reviews because this update is going to cause a lot of people like myself to just delete the app all together. Please get it together Snapchat. This update is HORRIBLE seriously, And I mean that in the most un-trolling way possible. Please do something 😩🙏🏼
Revert it to how it was please, thnx
Terrible update, only reason they did it was for more ad money
All of my friends want to delete snapchat... thanks. Waste of time:)
Snap chat use to be the best app ever ! Now i barely use it. Change it back to how it was before this update !
The new layout is awful.  Please fix it. 
This update is garbage. Trying to stream line all of your friends stories and snaps into one page. Mucking things up, why don’t we just add all the news on the same page so we don’t have to make an extra swipe.
Please bring the old snapchat back
Sc is a great app but the new update is wack
This is a case of trying too hard done
These updates that they’ve been giving out doesn’t even seem to be progressing the more effective interface for user, since the update, everything is cluttered, random stories appear, my messages are all out of order, they need to revert back original format. Nobody watches the popular pages, so i don’t understand why they felt the need to make a page for the ex viners, make up artists, and big pages like ign or brother. They need to fix this ASAP 😤
:((
Bad
I wish it were possible to give it less than a one star rating but they probably don’t allow that as it could hurt someone’s feelings. Anyways, back when this app first came out it was decent enough and didn’t really need much expansion. But now it’s being targeted at literal 10 year olds. I feel embarrassed to have it on my phone and regardless if they do decide to revert to the last version, I’m not coming back to Snapchat. It has become such a chore to use and gets new pointless features instead of working out existing problems. Love using the filters to make myself look like a bunny 10/10 would enjoy being 5 again to enjoy this app.
The new Snapchat update is horrible!Bring the old one back‼️
Snapchat was so fun before the new update. Although, now it’s a hassle. It’s hard to keep up with my friends stories because the stories are not in order. Also, the update is making me lose my streaks even though I send them at the same time every single day. Lastly, MY VIEW ARE GOING DOWN. I used to get at least 130 views and immediately after the update I get only 70. Please change the update back to the old.
Terrible update, I would give it -5 stars if I could.
I’m losing streaks majorly. I keep sending streaks all the time Throughout the day and they still have timers. (They do send their streaks as well)
A lot of my friends on Snapchat HATE the new update. I don’t like it myself but now when I post on their if I post anything, my views have went down drastically because nobody is on there anymore. I get more views now on Facebook and Instagram so this new update may result in me deleting the app all together. If I were to make a suggestion, I would suggest coming up with a better layout because this one is not working. It’s a cluttered mess mixing conversations with stories.
Porque update? It was bueno but now it's  MAL!!! 
I loved snapchat until they released this new update. It’s too difficult to use. This update is only useful for people who are getting the app for the first time. However for other who have had this app for a long time, it is hard to do what you want to do because things are so different. A lot of people, including celebrities, do not like this update at all. This update is most likely the reason that Snapchat has a 1.8 star rating. Please go back to the old version.
So far the new update I actually got use to and fine with but one little problem. CHATS!! I don’t know how many times I want to throw my phone across the room because I want to respond to a chat but they move around after seeing the snap and having to play hide and go seek for them. This is the most frustrating feature ever. I do like having all the people sending me snaps at the top but can they stay in place after reading the message for like 30 seconds or so then be moved else where?? It’s also activating when a lot of people send you snaps and want to them read and respond but the move somewhere. Just PLEASE fix this!!! It’s annoying!! Other than that, everything is fine.
I have been on Snapchat since day one, the day I found out about this app I downloaded it. I’ll admit, part of the growing process for the app was a little spread out, it took a while, and it was a bit bland in the beginning until the face filters came about. The update that consisted of your personal story, with the discovery bar underneath, and then other people’s stories after that was, amazing. And the messages and streaks separated? Amazing.  But up to the point of this disappointing update, I find myself bored with Snapchat, and that’s it’s not very convenient anymore. I hate clicking on someone’s name only to accidentally enter their messaging area and have them ask me later why I was typing. It’s an awkward layout. I hate that I have to go to my profile just to access my story. Hate, hate, hate that. I have always been a supporter of Snapchat and it’s saddens me to have something that was SO good, and it be completely changed. Nobody wanted this dramatic change.  ANOTHER THING that just happened today, when I take pictures, sometimes I like to save one with text, and one without. Now, when you save something to your memories, it replaces it with or without text. Only one picture, you can’t have both. This is also very annoying and upsetting. I REALLY wish to see Snapchat go back to the good old days and simplicity, when the creators weren’t trying to over-think and over-do things. This was an amazing app, and I assure that if it went back to the previous format and layout, people would be more satisfied for sure. It’s really hard for me to want to stay on it. Snapchat went from 5 stars to about 2 and a half. 
This app used to be good
Clearly, NOBODY likes the new update, with evidence of only a 1.8 star rating to the previous 4.5+. If Snapchat refuses to bring back the old style, the least they could do is have a separate section for the chat page, another separate section for stories, along with an entire friend list somewhere.
After this last big update, when I try to move captions up, I keep accidentally deleting them. The same thing happens to my picture or video when I reach over to use the editing options sometimes, if my finger clicks the X on the way over... It would be freaking incredible, to us mere 10% of the population, if there was a lefty mode in settings to switch the editing options to the left side so we can actually reach them 😅😬
The New Update Is Trash ! No One Likes It. Change It Or I’ll Delete The App
Once snapchat was the greatest app ever made, but unfortunately that time has now come to an end! #booo!
CHANGE IT BACK!!!
I’ve always used Snapchat and I love it but the new update we have confused me and isn’t all that great I love it but I’m with a lot of people in the aspect of wanting the old layout back.
I don’t like the fact that’s I’m seeing others people stories that are irrelevant.🙃
This sh*t weak
Snapchat is wonderful but it could use some work. Maybe it would be better if you can see your story when you see everybody else’s. And maybe the filters could be combined to be even better! Although the updated version of Snapchat is not the best, but Snapchat is definitely my favorite app.
I would like to have an option to change your username at least once. Facebook gives you an option , Twitter gives you an option , instagram gives you an option . Please Snapchat ! I would like to change my username without having to make a new account!
The new update is wack go back to the last version.
I use to love this app honestly.  But the new update made it trash and I barely ever use it now. 
I was literally getting used to the update and then they do another update with the group, stories, and All and I absolutely hate it. The updates are getting worse and worse.
The new UI is terrible
I think that when snapchat made that HORRIBLE update they ruined everything they had done and they NEED to fix it😡.
Hate the new update! Its worse than before! Im done with snapchat!!! 😡
After the new update this app is basically just trash.
Until the latest update, snapchat has done a pretty good job with subtly, gradually turning the app into an ad machine. But they really jumped the gun this update, and consumers have finally noticed...you can't just turn your app into an ad machine without losing customers. Snap needs to strike a balance or their ads won't have an audience
Still hate the update it’s trash Snapchat just lost a bunch of people
This new update is so confusing! I like the control given to see the next story or not. Though to find messages or see how many unread stories is much more difficult now. I liked it much better when you saw the story it went to the bottom and only unseen stories were at the top. Also liked that the messages were much clearer swiping left and only messages were in that section. Please modify it!
I used to love snapchat, but I can’t stand this new update. My co tact’s constantly switch places and it is so confusing to use. GO BACK TO THE OLD VERSION
Hate the update go back to normal
Upon getting used to the new update, I apologize for my unkind review and actually come with ideas I’d love to see! First, when looking checking my stories, I’d like it if there were a way to refresh right there instead of going back to the messages/discovery to refresh data. Second, bring back the bitmoji to the top left! Seeing what I posted in my story is just dull in my opinion.
I loved snapchat, I used the app more than any other thing I have downloaded on my phone. Now, the app is only used to send my streaks and I get out of it. I can’t stand this new update! It makes everything cluttered and messy. First of all, not many people use the discover page, so I have no clue why it has its own separate page. Also, when I text my friends, their chat goes all the way to the bottom of all of the other snaps I’ve received. I have no idea when they text me anymore. I also don’t like how you guys made the stories mix in with the chats and snaps. I feel that people watch stories way more than they read articles on the discover page. If you wanted to separate celebrities from our friends, you should just put the stories into two groups, not two separate pages. All I’ve heard about snapchat was negative things ever since it updated. If you guys are loosing all of your customers AND getting all of this backlash, how come you don’t change it back? Honestly, I don’t mean to hate but I wish you can change it back to the old way, or atleast make it look like the old layout, I feel that would be appreciated by many. Your app was probably most popular before, and almost everyone I know used Snapchat. Now, your ratings went down to 1.8, and all of the comments are about the horrible update! What do we have to do to change it back?
update is trash
I absolutely HATE the new update. It’s way too complicated and everything is jumbled around. I WANT THE OLD SNAPCHAT BACK!
Needs To Go Back To The Old Update!
The new update is garbage. Like on a scale of 1-10 it’s a landfill of trash. If I could give this negative stars I would. Trying to see my friends stories has become quite the hassle and the new discover B.S. is just that. B.S. Nobody cares about popular stories. If we did, we would already be following those people. You guys really missed the target on this update.
I really loved snap chat but with this recent update I prefer not to use it as often. I hate that I can’t have oversight of the snaps from friends like I could before. It takes longer to find a snap by a friend I’ve seen before and wish to see again because it’s literally chaotic now. And the arrogance not to do anything about it by the company is even worse. Bye snap chat, I guess your time is over soon too!
I can’t even swipe conversations no more! Now I have to fully tap the conversation because of the additional things being added on the top which include “group, stories, & All “ which is good and all but at least change it up a bit to where people are still able to swipe on conversations instead of fully clicking them.
this update gotta go.put our messages back in chronological order !
Jk snap ily❤️
I use the app a lot and loved chats and best friends, the new update hasn’t been the best experience for me though. I do like the different fonts, but i don’t like how the stories are on the same side of the chats. It makes it difficult to find someone I would like to talk to when someone else who posts shows up first on the list. It’s harder to keep track of who I’m talking to and who’s talking to me.
Congrats Snapchat. You somehow managed to make your app go from the one I use the most to letting it gather dust. The user interface is counterintuitive and jam packed with ads. The only reason why I haven’t deleted this app is because I have a lot of snaps saved on it and I’m too lazy to export them one by one.
Change it back to the old format we out here still waiting
Due to the major update many people along with myself have complained about it, many others have stopped using the app entirely because it is easier to switch to another platform to share what you are doing with your friends. People in the world of fame have pulled out causing the stakeholders within snapchat to also pull out if a companies stakeholders aren’t happy why would you be? Hope for change.
Can y’all make it easier to delete all your conversations instead of having to click the “x” on EACH person. Thank you!
It started off great but this new app design is extremely confusing and unnecessary. It was great when the point was to send timed snaps to friends. Snapchat needs to revert back to its old look
Can you make a update to where you have a tab where you can send a single snap to all your streaks instead of having to click on everyone of them??
It was the app that I used daily as constantly. Now I don't wanna get on it. My phone does not automatically update but woke up today to Snapchat updating on its own. Please change it back! PLEASEEEEE CHANGE IT BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The people I used to follow on here rarely uses Snapchat now. PLEASEEEEEEEEEEE
This new update is completely uncompromising instead of worrying about the Ads and making a whole sheet for them how about you make users’ stories a priority. Very few people actually want to see their messages along side their friends’ stories and that’s what made the older versions so you useful. You would go one place for your messages and another place for stories the separation was good. And another thing that’s happened recently; yes I understand how advertising works and how you must make money but the frequency of Ads in between almost everyone of my friends’ stories that I watch. It’s excessive.  Furthermore, why not just revert back to an older form or compromise with your users after all they are what makes you money. The companies pay you but without users to see the Ads then there’s nothing. 
i hate this new snap update i want the old one back.
change it back.
the app keeps crashing and it’s really slow
This is the worst update Snapchat has ever created. I can’t even see the stories of people that I don’t talk to on Snapchat without scrolling really far down. Bring back the old one. Plus, I never asked to update the app cuz I always have automatic updates off. But for some reason Snapchat updated it for me. This is crap. I don’t want to be able to see everyone’s bitmoji all the time and Checking my own story is so bothersome. and the send snaps to friend part looks so weird. ugh. it’s annoying in every way possible.
I really liked using Snapchat up until the new update. Nobody was complaining about the way the app was set up. It was just fine. I don’t see the need to rearrange the entire app. It’s ugly and unnecessary. Please change it back.
The last couple updates of this app have been horrible. It’s out of order and messy. Snapchat just needs to accept that this update is not good and change it back. Listen to the people who use your app!
pls consider changing back. thx
Stop updating! Snapchat was fine before all this new snap crap.
At least fix that glitch or wtv is wrong when i try to swipe up from the list of who viewed my story
I only see about 20% of people story’s because I have to scroll so far through messages now. I haven’t read any discover articles since the major update because it’s so hard to find them. On the discover page are celebrities I never added. If I wanted to see their stories, I would have added them. I hate the new snap and barely use it. It was my most used app, but now I’m using Instagram stories.
I do not like the latest update at all!!
This app used to be a five star for me, but recently I’ve HATED the new update I want the old one back, it would make my experience using Snapchat more enjoyable; I am also sure I am not the only one who thinks like this. I would truly appreciate if you guys could change it back to its old format. Thank you.
I miss the old Snapchat  Straight from the go snapchat Easy to control Snapchat  Does what you are told snapchat  I hate the new Snapchat  The hard to use Snapchat  The bad reviews Snapchat  It’s time to LOSE snapchat! 
This “new” update is complete garbage and the simple fact that they know everyone hates it but decided that “ it is what it is” really pisses me off.
This update has killed snap for good !
This update is awful, I don’t understand why would you change it, it was perfectly fine now it’s just trash, you guys will slowly loose everyone who has downloaded this app, it’s so hard to work the app if I could give a 0 stars I would but there is something’s I do like, for example the new fonts for the text the gifs the multi captions that’s all good but the stories and text are just something else and that should be fixed
Hate the update! It's so terrible I can't find all my friends, I'm thinking abt just deleting the app. So annoying
You already know where you failed no need to explain my self!!! The number of star's speak for it self not to be rude but I'm not using it thanks
The app keeps crashing
I’ve had snapchat for years and I use it everyday. All I’m gonna say is that this new update is trash👎🏽 it’s so bad that I think I’m jus gonna remove my Snapchat account and never use the app anymore. It’s in the creators best interest to go back to the update before this, because snapchats overall ratings has gone down since the update.
y’all literally ruined everything about the app w/ the update smh
If I could, I would rate it a 0 star. The “update” is complete trash.
I’ve had Snapchat for a while, I use it very often. I’m highly upset that people have been complaining so much, speaking up about how the feel about the app & you guys have no been doing ANYTHING to simply fix it back to the way your customers like it to look. The app is suppose to be for us to like & you’re being selfish.. the app updated itself and that’s not right. Y’all was so quick to change it, I don’t know why you’re not being quick to fix it back to the way people have been asking to change it back too.
The new update is even worse!!!!!!!
I used to be a daily user of snap, until the update. the company changed the format and honestly its really ugly now and literally no one likes it. they got rid of the stories page and combined it with your chats (idiots) which makes finding stories hard, like dude i cant even find my own story. because of the whole story thing, it makes the chats alllllll out of order and when i want to find the person i want to talk to, im sitting there scrolling for like 5 minutes looking for their name. things were so good before the update, the sun was shining, my story had tons of views, my chats were all in order, but now, i want to cry because the update is so bad. #bringbacksnap
You guys are killing your own app just turn it back to the way it was please for god sakes 🤦🏽‍♂️we just want the old version back
i got yet another terrible update and i cant find the flash button🙄 really snapchat! im thinking about not using snapchat anymore thats how difficult it is now!🙄
This update is very confusing and is hard to navigate around the app. Change it back please
Complete trash with the new update
Don’t get too attached to your snap streaks. Eventually Snapchat will make you lose them. :)
Didn’t record the sound for a vid I took that was very important and special and me telling my sis she’s going to see her fav artist. So thanks Snapchat for your terrible app that bugs out and doesn’t record your sound
I can’t stand that there are snaps in my feed from people I never followed. I’m not interested in those people! If I were, I would have followed them! The previous version was great. Nobody, absolutely nobody, likes this new update. And it’s irritating that you didn’t even give us a choice about updating. It was forced on us by your decision of having the app update on its own. Please go back to the previous version. Take a look at your ratings, and pay attention.
snapchat used to be one of my favorite apps but ever since the update, i hate it. for example, i don’t know what strange algorithm they have to order the snaps you receive, but i don’t know why a snap i received 20 seconds ago is below at least 50 people? One more thing that i hate, is that when i go to click on someone’s name, the page refreshes and makes me click on someone else’s name. please revise the software to the old platform. the ratings will go up and so will the amount of people using snapchat! i don’t know why you haven’t done it already.
I really don’t like the update. And you updated it without my permission. I am very unhappy. Please, sir, change it back.
Stories are what makes this app fun and now no one watches them especially private stories!!! Please undo the update. Also what happened to chronological order???????????
I use Snapchat to communicate with friends and I subscribe to certain people (celebrities) because I want to see their snaps and keep up with their doings. Not for quizzes and people (celebrities) I don’t subscribe to.  Hopefully that will change. I didn’t see a need for an update. It was good the way it was.
You guys KNOW the update is trash yet you don’t care about your customers enough to change it. Really great company you got going on.
I like the new layout but maybe if it was organized better it would be a looooot better.
You didn’t have to separate personal friends and put them in a whole other category, you can litter ads all you want into the app, but there’s no reason to mix everyone we follow in with them.
The new update is the worst way more confusing than it needs to be
Why change something that wasn’t broke. Now this is broke, so change it back to the old update. Don’t even like using this app anymore.
snapchat had always been my favorite app. i would text me friends on here, share my photos, anything anyone else did. then the first update happened. all of my friends got it first so i was truly dreading what i knew what would catch up to me. and when it happened i was infuriated. but when the next update was to come i was looking at the ratings and everyone had thought it would change back to the old version- but little did i know, a smack in the face was coming our way. all you guys added was stupid gifs that no one cares about. truly am considering deleting snapchat because it’s so dumb now. snapchat needs to come out with an option of what style they want to have, like choose from the update or the old one, or to change all the way back. like seriously guys, you should have known better than to change the whole setup.
It’s a f*cking snapchat update you all act like it’s the end of your life. Try deleting snapchat for a week and see if you can even function See how many urges you’ll get to pull out your phone to snapchat and the app won’t be there Count how many times that happens to you I dare you 
I. Hate. It. This is sad
WE HATE THE UPDATE
Why fix what isn't broken?
I frequently used Snapchat but have found it annoying to use since the last update. Therefore, I have found I don’t really check it anymore.   The story moving locations has strangely had a big impact on usability for me. Additionally, I have a harder time tracking messages sent from friends.  I think there could be long term benefits that were envisioned for this update- drawing more interactions between users by separating out businesses from “friends” when seeing a story.   But, I think with everyone calling for the old format, course correcting “backwards” isn’t a bad idea. Why not message it like “we shouldn’t have changed a good thing.” You can still push out innovation through the app while reinstating its prior simple and easy to use platform. 
I cant even swipe in a conversation cause of the “all, stories, and groups” at the very top🙄 you guys need to switch back to the old layout and stop changing crap around😒
Used for mean friends to pick on you I know this isn’t Snapchat that caused this but it was over stupid Snapchat
Hate the new update want separate story’s and the most recent people I sent a snap up top not at bottom. The friends list is also very small.
tbh, i loved snapchat!!!! i used it everyday! except the new update came out and i am not a big fan. also, gifs came out and i dont have them :( i recommend going back to the old update
REVERSE THE UPDATE. Nobody likes it or knows how to use it. Even if we did know how to use it, we still wouldn’t like it.
i managed to avoid the rage everyone went through when the stupid update that got rid of your friends story line up dropped but my phone just did an automatic update and now here i am! ugh i hateeeee it!!! please change it back! i love the new gif stickers and such but the stories being in the same area as your messages HAS TO GO!!! put it back where you can watch all the stories in a row! def gonna delete the app and just stick with insta stories if it stays like this... WHO’S stupid idea was this?? FIRE THEM
I HATE the update, you made a great app confusing! I want to be able to see my friends & stars together, don’t force me to discover things i don’t care about! you blew it Snapchat, bring back the old version or lose most of your users forever!
I can’t tell where my friends’ stories are and discover is all the other stories I don’t really watch. Make it easier to use! This version is terrible. Makes me want to delete the app until its redesigned!
The newest update is better because you can now see the stories in a separate spot, however private stories are useless on this update because they’re jumbled in with all the news articles
Don’t try to adjust it. Change it back.
Snapchat CAN YOU PLEASE MAKE AN UPDATE WHERE WE CAN CHANGE OUR USERNAMES PLEASE!!!!!
Is a great app but with this update it’s trash I was hoping they go back the main problem is it feels so so so disorganized and cluttered
I finally deleted the app after years of just rather not use it at this point
I have the new update
I think the update is great i love just about everything exceptttt how the friends portion is set up
Trash
I used to like sc but then they update it and now I lose my streaks and it’s so stupid
New interface is horrible
plz make stories and conversations in separate places again thanks
We still never got our streak back. Me and @smithe2021 and it was really high, it was her highest and if we get it back we won’t lose it again so can we please get it back??
This is so confusing and I can’t find anything! AND WHERE MY VIEWERS WENT? let’s just change it back or at least give us a tutorial on how it works. Y’all finna make me delete this confused mess
Snapchat used to be so simple and fun and now they’ve clearly caved to those providing paid content and redesigned to make garbage nobody wants to see the main focus while you have to awkwardly fumble through to find your friends’ content.... the whole point in using it.
snapchat is a good app for communicating w friends but they have been making too many changes to their app’s layout recently. These new layouts do not make the app easier to use but rather more confusing, making everyone want to use this app less.
Absolutely terrible!! Don’t download.
Please brang back old snapchat
So the update is really annoying and complicated for most of us. I guess it's safe to say that most of us wants the old version of Snapchat back. It's crazy how we can't view stories on our discover page. And on top of that, I can't even slide to preview a message without it sliding over to groups or individuals and things like that. Moral of this review, change Snapchat back to the way it used to be.
All my friends have deleted Snapchat bc of this HORRIBLE update. Change it back!!
The stories on the same page as other snaps was a HORRIBLE idea. It’s hard to see all the stories and you can’t just choose the ones you want to see like in the past update. I don’t mind the rest of the new update just the stories need to be on a separate page.
Snap was amazing until the update and now my camera is stuck on my face and won’t switch. Thanks a lot snapchat.
It’s actually not that bad. People complain too much 🙄😒😒😒
Ok the original snap was way better and I tried so many hacks to get the old snap back and it keeps updating by itself and my snap keeps crashing and I have to go delete the app and re download it and I literally have lost all my streaks because of it I’m just so frustrated just plz snap change it back to the old update
Snapchat’s newest update ruined all the fun.
I hate it
Just horrible!
ever since the update it has been terrible.
reminding y’all that i hate the update that’s all
We want the old update back not this BS!
I can’t get the fonts that everyone else could have & I still can not add one of my friends. Snapchat also doesn’t help with anything at all. I have requested things to ask them and they don’t help. I wish Snapchat had a number
I use to love Snapchat but the update is very annoying
Snapchat has surprised me with its previous updates. Most of them have been really good and useful. I personally don’t like the new update that has been given to the app. Everything is mixed up, Peoples stories are in the same space where your messages are. The latest update tried to divide the stories with your messages but it’s even worse. Before the update you could peek the chats that you had without the other person seeing that you opened it. I used to like Snapchat and I mostly used it all the time but now I barely use it.
The new update is the worst. Such a horrible design. Bit emojis are confusing now. Why change something that was working just fine? Never using this app again.
I keep having hourglasses/losing streaks even though I will constantly be snapping those people back and forth. They won’t go away until after the 3rd or 4th time I’ve snapped someone and my streaks are being lost bc of it. It’s making me very annoyed.
What were you guys thinking about this stupid update but you guys fr need to change it back before I delete the app 😒I didn’t ask for the stupid update it’s just happened and I hate it 😤
My microphone isn't working on snapchat, when I take a video the sound  It's like Snapchat is recording sound in a background noise canceller mode, witch is not suitable for Snapchat. Audio recording is fine on the default camera, Instagram, etc. I mean you’ll been going from good to worst.  Make Us Happy!
It used to have a 5 star rating until they decided to use this crappy new update that ruined the app and has caused me to practically hate snapchat
So I was scrolling through the story’s and I see there’s a new font change and I go on mine to see if I have it and I don’t then there’s no update and I still don’t have it and it’s soooo annoying
I love Snapchat, but ever since the update I have boycotted the app, I look everyday for an update! Please fix it Snapchat!
This update sookz. That is all.
This new version is HORRIBLE! I don’t enjoy using this app AT ALL anymore. And my conversations won’t stay cleared! It’s SO cluttered!
Change back
The new update has been out for awhile now, and you’d think I would be used to how it works but no. I don’t like how you can only view a friend’s story then it goes away. As for the ads and story’s that are on the other page? Why would I care about some of this stuff? It’s annoying. Please change it back. As you can see, many people, including Kylie Jenner, don’t like the update. CHANGE IT BACK!!!!!
The new format is trash Chang it back to the original!!!!!
I really hope a new media platform seizes this opportunity and shuts Snapchat down like Instagram did to Vine. Nobody wants this update, so busy trying to please the celebrities. Update- Sooo Kylie lost y’all about $1.8 BILLION by saying she hates the new update Too! 😂 🤦‍♀️
Never new a popular app such as snap chat would make such a terrible update that ruins the whole Snapchat experience 🤦🏻‍♂️
The new update is the WORST.  It’s so unusable.  Please change it back
A cool thing that came with the update though are the new fonts, but for some reason I cannot change my fonts, which makes me hate the update even more. When you’re typing it’s supposed to show up right above your keyboard, but whenever I type it’s not there. I don’t know if you would be able to fix this because it seems like I’m the only one with this problem but it’s really annoying
I don’t think an iPhone(or any phone for that matter) should be completely shutting down when someone uses Snapchat. No I’m not talking about the app crashing to the home screen, I wish mine was doing that. I mean the app is forcing my phone to shut down, like it has a dead battery. I can open the app just fine, no problem there. But if I do ANYTHING ELSE, Snapchat forces my phone to shut down, my screen turns black and the little loading circle comes up. Trying to recognize a face? Force shut down. Trying to take a picture through Snapchat? Force shut down. Trying to take a video? Force shut down. Trying to look at your friends stories for the day? Force shut down. Trying to read the messages from your friends you haven’t heard from in 4 months and can only contact them through Snapchat? Force shut down. I’m done with Snapchat. Never. Installing. Again.
I hope the Snapchat app developers are listening to the reviews. I'm not the most avid user of Snapchat but when I did use it was easy to navigate. Now it's just confusing. If you want to keep customers and have them stop going over to Instagram stories, I highly recommend you change this update or go back to the original format.
Snapchat used to be simple and fun. But now they’ve completely ruined it. It’s so confusing to navigate and terribly designed. When I open a snap at the top of my list, after I view it, it goes down about 5 spaces and it’s so stupid. I just want the people who I snap at the top then the rest of the stories to be separate! Terrible job snapchat, nobody is pleased. Fix it soon because we all want to delete the app.
The newest update is amazing . I don't understand why everyone hates it. They say "its ugly" "its compact" "I don't know how to use it" and my responses are always -"its not ugly its more fluent and easy to use things" "its bot compact its just smaller so people that are famous you follow is to the far right and your friends are to the left" "its definitely not hard one single ounce. If you watch the video when it first updated it tells you how to simply use it 😉. Click on the cirle photo to watch stories. Clioc names to text or reply. Taking pictures is the same. Send to friends alphabetically. Alphabetize you streaks so they're in the same letter (I use S-[their name])." its simple and cute
Yeah
Once i open a snapchat is disappears and i have to scroll to the bottom to find it. To watch stories i have to click so many times to watch the ones i want. this new version is horrible.
It’s too hard to watch ppls stories and the fact they aren’t in chronological order makes me forget to snap ppl bc they end up at the bottom of my list. Pls just fix those two things
This app was fantastic, and I've loved it for years. And I get that some apps make bad updates and such, but why on Earth would you not listen to your customers when they ask you to change it back?? Clearly everyone hates it and if you went back to the version before this, everyone would be happy again. LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS
The new update is absolutely terrible! It’s not user-friendly anymore and no one likes it , Y’all should just change it back !👎🏼🤔
Can y’all just update it back to normal already please I’m tired of deleting and downloading the app
I do not like the new update on snap at all. I have tried to give it a chance since it updated itself (even though I have automatic updates turned off)  and try to get used to it, but its not working for me. I wish snapchat would listen to their users and revert back.
This app is trash
👆 That is what this app has come to with the new update. Change it back now and stop being sellouts to commercial snaps!!!!
The gifs update was absolutely the best update snapchat has ever done. However, since there are so many I wish they had categories. Also it would be easier to find the ones I like if folders were created to put your favorite stickers and gifs in so we don't have to keep searching everywhere for our favorites.
guys the update is perfectly fine with me. If you don't like it, just delete the app. It's not hard
While I am still not a huge fan of the update, adding that “subscribed” section to discover made it a lot easier to find the articles I want to read instead of random articles. Thanks for that addition!
Well even your latest update still a mess, why not taking it back to the old version . You better consider people opinions before its too late.
I just feel as if y’all should change it back to where we can see our friends stories without the discovery bs in the way 🤷🏾‍♀️
Do you guys not read these reviews? How hard is it to keep things simple? Why does the entire app have to change completely every time a new update comes out? What's wrong with keeping things simple and keeping things the way they were? It gets harder and harder to use. You took a fun, easy to use social media app that everyone loved and ruined it because the money-hungry creators only use the app for personal gain and don't care for the opinions of the users that bring them their success. Such a shame.
I don't know how or why, but you've made Snapchat even worse. Now when trying to open someone's chat, it takes me to the Stories. Thank you for giving us access to our stories back, but at the cost of our chats?
They added lots of things sure, but this new update didn’t fix the giant problem.. all of my friends have left snap to use IG stories because of the previous update, and I know there’s plenty more out there who have done the same.. with the new update you would think they would have fixed the Stories, the one thing that brought EVERYONE to Snapchat in the first place.
i liked the app and then SOMEONE had a “great” idea to change everything and make it A MISERABLE APPLICATION WITH A HABIT OF DISAPPOINTING PEOPLE.  thank you for reading goodbye. 
Honestly, I tried updating the new SC updates (fonts) and it didn't work. I tried exiting the app and going back in, didn't work. I'm not sure how to fix it but I really don't like the new update either.
You guys talked about a reverse update. Where is it !??? Please
I love Snapchat, hate the new update. Things have become way less social. It’s harder to find people’s stories because some of them go into that weird page that is filled with a bunch of people that I don’t know nor care about! Views on my stories has also gone down, which a lot of my friends have said happened to them. Not sure if it’s because people cannot find it or because people have just stopped using the app.   Snapchat should be more concerned about creating an interface that is user friendly rather than making changes for change’s sake. 
The new update is horrible I don’t know who thought it would be a good idea but until it’s fixed HELLO instastory!! At least they have their stuff together. Stupidest update ever Snapchat was fine just the way it was
Duuuude update is dumb af
all i’m gonna say is that the newest update is even worse than the one before it. the app is becoming even more crowded & makes me feel panicked. pushing the a story & group section into the already busy area, in my opinion, was a rather large mistake. you used to be able to slide to open a chat & since i’m into the habit of doing that it takes me a while to remember that i can not longer do that & it bugs. when you received a chat you’d be able to slide half way into the chat without fully opening it & be able to see what the person said, now i can’t because it swipes to a new area. didn’t we do a poll to change snapchat back? how did that go, cause last time i checked all the other opinions had lower votes than the section which said you should change snapchat back to its old format & style. i don’t mean to be rude, only to state my opinion.  -a concerned snapchater 
Not a big fan of it because of the updating of your friends when you're trying to snap one of them, and then it refreshes so you send a snap to someone you didn't want to. And I miss being able to click on who's story i want to watch and doing that all in one sitting. Plus, with the Bitmoji faces it feels too crammed on the snap page.
Used to be great now it won’t even start up. It crashes even after I re-downloaded it three times. Social Media is killing itself.
I love snapchat, I have been using the app for 4 years now. With the new update snapchat is harder to find the people you want to talk to or recently have snapped because if someone posts on their story it automatically filters them to the top. I realize there is the option to “Mute” stories but I have over 700 people on my snapchat and that would take a very long time to mute everyone’s story. I believe snapchat should keep some new features of the update like the bitmoji selfies and the filters and lenses but move the layout of snapchat back to the older easy to use version.
I would like it if you gave us the option to change our username whenever we want, kind of like Twitter & other social media so we won’t have to make a new account.
Snapchat is awesome but the update is terrible change it back every one hates it and it is a huge inconvenience
Y’all are outs and give 0 sh*ts about the community you built
It’s been weeks and I still hate the update. It’s too jumbled and I still can’t navigate it. I’m considering deleting it and sticking to Instagram. Sincerely, Someone who would pay you to get the update off of my phone. 
Now I don't even know how to use it :v lmaooo!
Snapchat reverse this update and stop playing games. Nobody asked for this and you keep ignoring it like we did. That’s honestly why y’all got damnnear 1 star ratings soooo I’d fix that.
So the first update was terrible. But I started to get used to it not mind. Like this new update has three tabs and I cannot stand it I’m about ready to delete the stupid app
Your app used to be fun. It was great to see all the snaps and now it’s AWFUL. I don’t understand why you would change something that everyone likes. This update did not make it better by any means!! Seriously thinking of deleting!! Maybe everyone else should too!!
I will delete sc it is to cluttered. Don’t get me wrong I loved it now it is too messed up.
The new looks itself isn’t ideal, we can all agree on that. My issue with it most, though, is that it is incredibly slow and buggy. Specifically, when I take a video, it freezes and often causes the app to crash. It’s happens with every video I’ve taken since my app got upgraded a few days ago. Disappointing since so often my Snapchat’s are videos.
There are numerous reasons why i deleted this app. Main reason being... there are people in my friends list i can no longer find or contact due to this ridiculous updated. I also had subscribed to several news and magazines on my snapchat (i watched these daily) that i can no longer find... I have contacted snapchat numerous times with no response... thanks snapchat for NOTHING. I no longer want this app or ANY social media!
i updated my snap and not everything is there! on the main page, everything is the same and i know somethings have changed, but when i take a pic, new things are there like gifs!
The new Snapchat update is stupid I use to be on it all the time and now I’m not
I miss the old snapchat  strait from the go snapchat easy to control snapchat does what it’s told snapchat I hate the new snapchat  the hard to use snapchat  the bad reviews snapchat it’s time to lose snapchat 
Can Snapchat PLEASE go back to how it was???
Not using Snapchat until the old version is back. I cannot stand it. It's hard to use and less friends see your stories.
The new update is not very good. It is very annoying to have stories pop up and load up your conversations. I’m requesting to go back to the old style.
The update is god awful.
Hate the new update it is way too confusing and makes me not want to use the app anymore!
This update is beyond garbage. Snapchat has hit an all time low. Just change it back to the way it was before everyone gets used to it!!
I’ve had snapchat Since 2007. It is been my favorite app to use to keep connected with friends and to network my business throughout the world. However lately my app constantly shuts down. Constantly freezes and nothing ever works the way it supposed to. With that being said I’m getting pretty sick of Snapchat and it’s stupid streaks. I hope you guys will resolve this issue and get it back to the way used to be.
The update is horrible. You can tell all snapchat cares about is making money with all these new ad features. Bring back the old snapchat, we all want it
All of my streaks are disappearing?
i love snapchat and i use it all the time but ever since you guys updated, it went down hill and i don’t like it very much. please change it
I really don’t like the new update at all , snap chat should go back to the old update
Yes, now stories are separate so thank you from everyone... but now we can't even slide to snap text someone without opening every snapchat that they sent?? This needs to be fixed because it is getting way to difficult / confusing for the users.
bad
Okay, I tried to be positive about this new daring update to Snapchat, but can’t do that anymore. The app is so f’ng annoying to use now. I have stopped posting stories, stopped looking at other people’s stories, and just stopped using the app as much overall. You guys are catering to what advertisers want more than the users that put you where you are right now. Something positive did come out of this though: I’m using Instagram stories much more frequently. Nicely done, Snapchat 👏🏼👌🏼
Screw your update change it back or go bankrupt
Bring back the original Snapchat back!
PLEASE GET RID OF THIS NEW UPDATE. NO ONE WANTS TO SEE RANDOM PEOPLES SNAPCHATS. IF WE DID WE WOULD OF ADDED RANDOM PEOPLE AS FRIENDS. WHY WOULD ANYONE FORCE US TO WATCH RANDOM PEOPLE ON SNAPCHAT?? THIS IS HORRIBLE AND EVERYONE SHOULD START USING A DIFFERENT APP
Snapchat is an amazing app, I use it to talk to many of my friends, and it’s great. But ever since the new update, everything is super weird. The entire layout is terrible, you have to view stories in a really weird way, and the public stories are really super difficult to find. I hope Snapchat takes away this update, and let Snapchat go back to normal.
the app was good until the bogus new update
Why did snapchat update this. It just stupid. Snapchat said they they’ll bring back the old version back on the 20th of February but snapchat lied to everyone, so snapchat, I beg you please bring back the old version so that way I will view my friends story on the discover please.
New update is trash. Many focus is on celebrities and money from ads. Byeeee
If I didn’t have a 700+ streak that I really care about I would delete this stupid app. The update is HORRIBLE. change it back already. NO ONE LIKES IT
Over all I loveee Snapchat but lately my streaks are not working.. I had over 34 streaks most of which I talk to on a regular basis with and no matter how many snaps I sent to them.. they still disappear and I lose my streak! I dislike the new update so much though, can you please put it back #snapchat
could be update get any more uglier and confusing???? I HATE IT
Fix the app back
this update wack
Honestly I would still use Snapchat to this day if they didn’t update it and changed the whole format .. I think If snap wants there users back they need to change it back to the old format ! It’s horrible and confusing to use & I know people Would get back on it if they did the old format again!
They really shot themselves in the foot with that update- I was loyal to Snapchat and refused to use instagram stories but now they've killed it, so goodbye
📉🤦🏾‍♀️
If I could give this zero stars I would. I want the old Snapchat back!
The update is terrible. Everything is confusing and my views are way down so it’s easier to just switch to Instagram and only use snap for filters.
This app is great it lets me talk to my friends all around the world and had great filters for fun photos
Update is really really bad
Snapchat was great before the new update came out.   In this new update, everything is harder to find and access, and communication is difficult since the fact that whenever someone places something on their story, they get pushed to the top of your messages, and you have to scroll down to retrieve your previous texts.  Snapchat is very difficult to use, and what’s worse is that no matter what you try, you cannot reverse it. People say there are hacks where u can fix it and return it back to the way it was, but in the end the hacks are futile.   I rate Snapchat one star for its poor service to its users. 
Besides redesigning their app to make it harder to view friends’ stories, I’m sick and tired of seeing racist, anti-white, stories from SPONSORED sources. Also tired of oversimplified news stories from biased sources that I don’t want to see
Piggybacking stories onto messages makes everything confusing and cluttered. I’ll be using IG stories from now on, snap was my fav app and it’s not ruined by this update.
Horrible up grade.
Snapchat turned from my favorite to my very least favorite app. So disappointed. It updated about two weeks ago and I still hate it. Sometimes it will notify me that someone snapped me but I won’t get the snap until 3 days later. Everything about it is so dumb and I hardly use it anymore.
It was good till they added this stupid update
I feel as if this update was very confusing. It doesn’t give an accurate time of when people actually snap. Give us the option of going back to the old version. Snapchat use to be one of my favorite social media outlets, not anymore going back to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
Simply just jumbled....
I HATE the new layout. I have to search and search for the stories I want to see amid all the the stupid adds and stories of celebs. Give me be old layout back.
The app is still trash. Ok so the newest update trying to make things easier to use honestly did nothing. It’s barely even noticeable that anything changed. The entire discover page is still useless. I’m really annoyed, snapchat was my primary social media but now I don't even use the app. I only open it to keep my steaks alive
My snapchat had been working fine until two days ago when I couldn't read the snap stories of my friends. Then I could open the snapchats I received from my friends, which then led to me not being able to open the app at all. I'd try to open the app and it would crash after a few seconds. Tried to open it for TWO DAYS and nothing. Very disappointed. :(
The prior updates helped to make things more fluid and streamlined. This last update simply made things more difficult and unnecessary. To split the stories up based on whose following you back and who isn't is stupid. And seems as though it's just a tactic to get people to view snapchats advertised stories. I'm missing tons of stories now because the stories are in 2 different locations as opposed to being all together like before. I'm constantly hitting "chat" instead of story since that's been combined now. Smh. Snapchat used to be so good and now it's just more of a hassle
Deleted my SC coz of the recent trash update
An update was yesterday and made it even worse
I always loved the app but the new update makes it confusing. I hate having people's stories mixed in with my personal snaps and chats. Everyone who has done the update feels the same way please revert that back to the way it use to be, separated, please!
Please add the dragon filter with purple wings to the lenses you can create. It was the best
why why why ?  we are so confused and the new update is so complicated guys plz get back to the old version, you are losing us ! 
The new update made this app almost impossible to use anymore and very frustrating.
This update is trash and needs to be changed back , too confusing and stupid.. go back to the way it was mayne
Please please the new update is terrible!!!!
Change snapchat back to how it was.
The new update that doesn’t allow you to swipe right to see the persons snaps without opening is awful. It should just open everything when you click on a profile!!!!
the app is great but the new update is actually terrible  OKAY SO YOU DIDNT FIX IT WITH THE NEW UPDATE AT LEAST MAKE AN OPTION FOR THE OLD SNAP BACK IN SETTINGS 
Still horrible. Give us the old snapchat back
Let’s all agree this update was terrible. The only point I see is that they can push more of their spammy buzzfeed type content on us now.
Hope you’re proud of that update. Way to screw it up, guys.
Snapchat has always been my favorite messaging app, hands down. I love using it for just normal texting because let's face it, you'll never want to see 90% if your text conversation anyway and the 10% that matters is easily saveable. This update is horrid. People that incessantly snap me that I can't exactly delete or block but don't really want to hear from are constantly at the top of my messages! Just because someone is always snapping me doesn't mean their story update is a high priority to me.  And why on Earth are messages and stories mixed together? I almost never look at stories so now the majority of the messages page is clutter I don't care about.  I remember the days when Facebook would issue a massive update and people would flip out -- the difference was that they'd complain about the update by posting on Facebook. Snapchat, however, is alienating users.  I know y'all need to generate revenue. How about you take a page from Facebook's strategy? Go back to the old design but modify the way stories are displayed. Mix ads in as their own thing. Facebook has proven that quality content will engage and convert. 
I LOVE the new update it has all of the stories on the same page as the messaging. I love it!! It is really not that bad when you use it for a while. So I hope Snapchat does not change it. Cause what happens if it takes away all of your streaks you would not like that so go back and give them a good review 😍😀
Snap chat won’t even open lol. Crashes as soon as I click on the app.
Change it back please, everything is so cluttered and unorganized!! There doesn't need to be an entire page dedicated to celebrity snaps! Also viewing stories is a lot more difficult because now not as many people view each other stories. The old format was beautiful in which it gave us freedom to view which snap stories we wanted to see. Please return to the old format
I loved Snapchat for a long time used to be my first social media app that I would check constantly . Now with the new update it got more complicated, to crowded on one screen, and less fun. I’d wish the developers listen to the comments and switch back and make 80% of their users happy again. I understand the more “famous” people now are easier to access , but remember who your clientele is... the average person. I use the app less now and could see myself not using it  anymore if the settings don’t go back to what they used to be.
So O updated my snapchat and it says that there would be new fonts and multiple captions and gifs, well, the gifs were there but the mutiple captions and fonts weren’t there 🤧
This Snapchat update is so annoying!!! Now they updated it to where you can’t side over on conversations!! Now if you side over you will be sliding to all the stories!! HOW DO YOU VIEW YOUR CONVERSATION?!
Please why there lag in last update 👻🤬
Love Snapchat, the face filters, the Bitmoji (I caved in and started using them even tho I SWORE I wouldn’t), the location filters, snap streaks- all of it has been fun so far. Until this past update at the beginning of February. I heard so much complaining on Twitter about it so I decided I wouldn’t do it. My boyfriend came home and immediately started to complain about the update and I just laughed and told him I hadn’t done it yet. In fact, I even turned OFF my auto update for all apps on my phone just so I wouldn’t be forced into it...well joke was on me because Snapchat updated itself anyway. Without my say so....🧐 so now I’m stuck navigating this horrendous app that offends my eyes at every screen. I would say what I dislike but honestly after reading the reviews, do I really need to?  Well actually yes I do: -discover page/ I’m forced to look at stories of famous people I don’t know or care about now. -discover page/ no matter how many times you select “I want to see less of this” those SAME stories just keep popping up. -personal story area/ the circle you select at the top right corner of the screen to see your settings and such? Hate it. Do you know how long it took me to realize I could no longer just look at my friends list? That I had to actually select another circle to view my own story? -snap+message area/ really...that seems just about the worst part of this update. Normally I’d probably applaud the convenience of it but something about it just feels wrong. I don’t care to select the circles of people’s stories I want to see, add on top of that I can’t even select a group of stories I want to view and ignore the rest? -sending a snap to a group/ I can’t even begin to explain the torture this process is now....  The few pros? -when uploading a snap to your story you get to see what percentage it’s at, that was kind of nice. -the added fonts. This one is kind of iffy though because you can’t just click the large ‘T’ to access the big font which I enjoyed.  -apparently there was a new bitmoji update? Though I rarely mess with my bitmoji so it’s more of a pro for others. 
Okay, so to start.. I love Snap, even though it’s weird now because of the update.. anyway.. with all the updating that’s the app has gone through, why don’t we have a photo timer.. that would be awesome. It would give Snapchat another awesome aspect if you ask me.
I use Snapchat often, and since the new update I kinda hate that l do. It’s kinda hard to see all my friends stories and I wanna see them. Please change it back or l will leave a worse review!!!!
we all hate the new update. we all know it. even kylie jenner hates it. i went from exclusively snap stories to using ig stories if i want people to actually see it because no one checks snapchat anymore since the update. i will literally save a snap with a filter and post it on instagram. also i never look at the ads anymore because i don’t get on snapchat as much and definitely don’t go to the right side because it’s full of celebrities i don’t want to see. i just watch their stories on ig. so i can’t imagine advertisers are happy if this is a common occurrence with others. just do everyone a favor and change it back while we’ll still forgive you.
Please go back to the old version. Not only was it simpler, but the fact that I have to search for stories is way more complicated than any of the updates you’ve had. If you’re going to “upgrade” this hard, do your users a favor and make it easy to navigate, or at least easy to learn. Bluntly put: NO THANKS.
It’s absolutely incredible you haven’t fixed this yet.
I the new update I feel like just keeps getting worse and it should be reversed
Works good but you should make the filters free
So I'd been seeing people take to social media about how terrible this update is. I couldn't imagine it'd be that bad but just to  be on the safe side I decided I wouldn't update. That's when I learned that snapchat doesn't give a hoot what kind of decisions you want to make. The new Snapchat was on my phone like a thief in the night.   I know ppl generally don't like change and I usually don't get all up in arms about these things but it is truly awful. At first I couldn't figure out how to see my friend's stories. Finally figured how to check them through the messages area. A big problem is now I get significantly less eyeballs (views) then before. It has something to do with this feed that is saturated with random ppl's stories mixed with corporate ads. Essentially snapchat trying to dictate your content. It's everything I've come to disdain about Snapchat.   It's a shame also because I've ignored Instagram and FB stories simply to support Snapchat the originator of this idea. I've now uploaded my first Instagram story and it was very well received.   Snapchat might consider reevaluating their business practices if their own competition took their idea and is doing it better. I was really rooting for you guys. Filters are still the best. 
Ok first of all I loved Snapchat. I used it daily multiple times a day. I really enjoyed having all my subscriptions right there together and I chose what I wanted to see. Now y’all do. I’m seeing stories from people I have never heard of or some celebrities that I don’t care about or the Olympics and my subscriptions are kinda mixed in there. I keep hitting the ‘see less like this’ and it does virtually nothing to cut down on the pointless stuff. Y’all apparently changed the chat/friends stories thing which is the one thing I actually liked about the last update where all my friends stories were all in one place along with chats and did absolutely nothing to the discover portion. Make it where my subscriptions are in one tab and all the pointless stuff is somewhere else where it doesn’t get in my way. And also a way to change the font on an iPhone would be greatly appreciated! I’m so jealous of all my android friends that have pretty script fonts and all I can do is change colors and sizing of mine. Please listen to your users. Or I see a lot of people going to Instagram full time and ditching snap.
They only upload one or 2 filters a day and they’re not even good ones. I’m so over the animal ears, they need to bring back the crowns. Females aren’t feeling it...
I still hate it so bad
I’ve had Snapchat for four years. Out of all the updates the newest update is by far the worse. I could handle most of the updates before this update like the new colors, bitmojis, fonts, stickers and all the unnecessary things nobody asked for, but the format where all the stories are with the chats is really confusing. People have stopped using this app because of the new update. It’s hard to watch people’s stories if you don’t talk to them and you have to scroll all the way down to watch people’s stories of look for a specific one. It’s annoying and it feels like a puzzle, updates are supposed to make things easier to find not harder. Please go back to the old format.
سيئ جدا ولا يعمل
You know Snapchat was once a great social platform that was not at allllll confusing but once with the new update it seems as if everyone hates it.. if Snapchat keeps this update they are ignorant and obviously do not care on how we feel about this .. 37% of snap chat users are between the age of 18-24 which I find to be strange since Snapchat said that the app was confusing to them even though this age group are generally familiar with technology..once again I feel as if Snapchat should bring the old snap back.. Thankyou.
You know what we want Snapchat take away this new update or lose profit
Used to be fun and easy, now it seems like they're trying to force people into seeing or participating in events and stories most of us care nothing about. I liked it before the newest update.
Why can’t I see who all has seen my snap story anymore? Why are the messages and stories all clustered together? It looks so disorganized. Why isn’t the app refreshing all the time and letting me know when I get messages? Why why why…
Update is terrible
Words can't really describe how awful this new update is! Simply said, I don't even use Snapchat anymore. 
New update is more trash then my ex girlfriend.
Please go back to the old update, this app is now trash
If snapchat could go back to the first version we will be back on snapchat 25/7 and I'm totally okay with that. If snaps getting all this hate...why aren't they doing anything?
Y’all did another update and didn’t fix anything!!! Now I can’t read my messages without opening them... and y’all know what I mean by that
Not using snap chats anymore 👎🏻
I used to love snapchat but the latest upgrade is just not the best. Probably will delete the app soon.
ok the new stuff like the fonts and gifs are cool but... the reason why i use the app is to keep streaks. the update displays streaks in the middle, which is impossible to see when the streak is ending or has a timer. it’s frustrating.
The new update is unbearable
Before the latest update, snapchat was my go-to. A pal, a supporter, a true soul. snapchat USED TO let me easily watch the stories i wish to watch without confusion. snapchat USED TO have all my recent conversations at the top in order. now it’s like the first person is someone i talked to an hour ago, the second is someone i talked to a month ago, and the third is someone i talked to yesterday.   UNACCEPTABLE, MY FRIENDS.  It’s as if i had changed from the lovable girl i am now to a confusing hot mess without warning. some of you were lucky and had automatic updates turned off, but if you’re like me, you are as shook up as i am. i now assume that most of us have that turned off now which is sad. it’s as if snapchat was like “sorry snapchat can’t come to the phone right now? why? OH CUS ITS DEAD”  i will happily change this 1 star rating back to a 5 as soon as i have my real friend back  ps. i tried to rate it lower than 1 star but sadly not an option. apple, do better. 
User interface has completely gone to $h!t and your articles are 100% trash and useless waste of data. Half the articles are pop culture trash, and the majority are repeat articles that one reporter copied and pasted from another source.
seriously who thought of the idea of pilling everyone snapchat videos, can even figure out whos who... let alone find my own snapchat videos why do this creators always mess everything up ... oh well lets see what other app is hot on the market  RIP SNAPCHAT 
PLEASE GO BACK TO NORMAL PLENTY OF US HATE THIS NEW UPDATE IT WAS VERY PRETTIER THE OTHER WAY!!! THE BITMOJIS BY THE NAMES SRE UGLE ID RATHER HAVE THE OPEN AND SENT BOXES JUST PLEASE GO BACK TO NORMAL!!!!!
Just give us the option between designs, I’m about to delete Snapchat and go to Instagram because of this.
Everyone I know and me hey this newer updates bring back old Snapchat
I think the update isn't really well but I think you should make section on the top of the chat side. For example u go on the side where you could chat and on top of it under the search button u should put the option Groups|Stories|Chats. People would enjoy it more.
So it’s been sometime now Snapchat and it’s still the same. Why not listen to your users and make snapchat great again? Doesn’t the rating of the app speak for itself? A 1.8 rating is pretty bad if you ask me. But don’t take my word for it. It’s facts. Hope these reviews don’t go over your heads. New isn’t always good. Keep it simple.
New UI is annoying. Sometimes I don’t want my friends to be all up in my homepage every new story they post. Everything is cluttered and this update was suppose to ease users to something less all over the place, but lots on unnecessary information everywhere
Terrible
Brings of an error to try again. Tried so many times! :(
Hate to jump on the bandwagon but the update is trash. I honestly don’t understand how they chose to organize people’s stories and the snaps you receive. The change probably has something to do with advertisers getting their own tab. They probably thought that their fan base is so strong that people would get over it in a few days or so and then they would be able to capitalize on all the new possible ad revenue but I don’t think that’s the case. I’d say half of the people I know have completely stopped using the app and I myself took the time out to write this pointless review. The update is seriously horrible but will keep using the app until the Snapchat fad eventually fades to darkness. A huge change has to be made or the companies demise is right around the corner.
Seriously? I have to look through my whole list of friends to find out if someone posted a story? This is stupid and will be deleting my Snapchat if it doesn’t change
I agree with so many others the new snap is over crowed with everyone’s snap and story on the same screen! You guys are losing reviews and etc by continuing to not reverse the update this is horrible! I’m destined to uninstall the app after this encounter!
I love using Snapchat but the new update has made stop using snap a lot!!!
Snapchat was great. Then you ruined it. It’s almost impossible to swipe out of the app on the iPhone X. Fix it!
Totally hate it.
don’t get this app i can’t find anything anymore. i am so annoyed by this. this used to be simple and easy to use. now it’s like trying to defuse a bomb.
With the new GIF sticker feature, it takes forever for all sticker to load or doesn’t even load at all. If the GIF sticker took little to no time popping up like Instagram, it’d be great. Hope this problem is resolved.
Update is horrible!!! So difficult to use.
personally i hate the new update the way it’s set up, the way you view story’s, and the way you can see your story/streaks just isn’t good. please have it go back i don’t want to delete the app, so many people already are!!!!!
If I could give it less than one star I would... The new update is confusing and shows me snaps of people I don’t follow. I see they’re making suggestions based off people you think we’d like but wouldn’t we follow them if we did like them? I don’t care about a lot of those suggested snaps that you’re trying to show me. Please change it back to the list or at least give us the option to view whichever mode we want. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.
Snapchat is going to die out if they don't do something soon
Update Is absolutely terrible I’m deleting the app until they revert to the old version. I like the stories separate and it’s just so disorganized right now.
It’s so bad
Snapchat was absolutely ruined with the new update. It’s now a cluttered mess that’s too bothersome to use.
Just stop updating it, you all keep downgrading. Might as well delete Snapchat.
Dañaron la app con ese update nuevo. HORRIBLE.
Nothing everyone hasn't already said. Y'all really goofed on this one SC. This app is a hassle to use now.
One page for chats, one page for stories, one page for the other bulls*** no one cares about anyways. Keep it simple, there’s a reason we use Snapchat, it was simple and fun. You clusterf***** everything together and it needs to change.
Look Ik u guys have been getting a lot of bad reviews. But that’s because they’re true this new Update is truly horrid. Personally I still use the app but it has become extremely harder to use the app. So plz Whoever decided that is new Update was a good idea plz..Plz... Just revert to the old Snapchat set up.
the. new. update. is. so. bad. change. it. back. nobody. likes. it. when. are. you. guys. going. to. realize. that.
The update ruined it for me...it's so confusing and unorganized. Everything is all over the place🙄
YOU WILL EARN A LOT OF 5 STARS
The new update is terrible and I am still not sure why snapchat hasn’t done anything to fix it.
I enjoy the app, but recently I’ve found the Bitmoji of your character drawing a katana. Well I wanted samurai armor to go with my Bitmoji but there simply isn’t any. How am I supposed to chase off the filthy Gaijin without armor?!? Explain that to me Snapchat
Used to love snapchat, now i ended all my streaks and no longer a snapchat user until this bs is fixed.. Shame on you guys. lol nice 1.8 rating
Honestly this new update is so difficult to understand. Mixing people with the discover news segments. And then throwing out people they think I would like. I obviously would be following them if I liked them. I rarely even go on Snapchat anymore since I don’t know how to use it.
Get rid of the update, you literally ruined the app
I Hate the update so much. It’s garbage to the fullest extent. Do not force people to switch to this ugly, difficult, HORRIBLE new update. We want the old snap chat back!! Social media shouldn’t be difficult to use and you guys found a way to make it absolutely awful. At this point just shut it down!
I honestly do not know what is happening to Snapchat :( it was all good before the update but then it became weird after the update. The new fonts were so cool! I loved them! They took those away too *facepalm* I actually am really upset that they took away the cool texts... why would they take away the best thing about the new update UGHH anyway the struggle is real :)) byee
ew
I’m sure you guys know we don’t like the new update. Can we get some action to fix it pls🙄y’all really just gone ignore our complaints? Lol, we don’t want to leave you guys. but if another app comes along with easier navigation and similar concepts, you guys are done.
Snapchat is really annoying...
Snapchat was doing fine until this update. I think they killed their own app with this new interface. If you’re like me, I had every story i could blocked on the stories tab. I believe they weren’t getting enough views on their ads and stories from partnerships that they rolled out this new update to make all that more in your face. With this update, everything is a mess. The way to view friends stories is butchered, especially when you click outside of your friends story circle and it takes you to the messaging screen. And yes, I’m aware that it takes time to get used to a new interface, but the old snapchat was better by a long shot. Highly doubt snapchat would go back to the old interface regardless of all the complaints and how many less people are using the app now.
So you guys still didn’t change that stupid update huh?! You have to do betterrr
Y’all saying the new update is too confusing really need to just take a breath cause it’s not even that hard. It’s vvv simple actually.
Ask any of my friends, Snapchat used to be by far my favorite social media, after the update I never use it. Please go back Snapchat, Kylie Jenner was right! Snapchat was so much better before.
It’s okay i mean, the new update will bribe anything like the last, but I still like it. I just wish that Snapchat would release what a bad idea this was and go back to the last one, because to be honest look how bad the rating is, and it’s just because NO ONE LIKES THE UPDATE, so I think it a good app not bad or anything but just don’t wast   Your time if you don’t what the last one was like, so get it if you want.
Snapchat has really downgraded from being super awesome to just having unnecessary updates. I really don’t like the new layout of having stories on the left swipe menu where your snap history is. If you have a friend who’s sent you a snap and has also posted a story, you can’t see how recently they’ve posted until you open their snap. You can’t see both times of their posting and sending because there’s no room! Combining the stories menu with your snap history doesn’t make sense and just makes it all crammed up. It was so much better seeing stories on their own separate side on the right and having them in order of recent posting. If there were too many complaints about the news stories, maybe they should be placed on a top or bottom menu where you swipe up or down to see the news.
Bring back old snap, new one’s trash
Honestly, this new update isn’t that bad. But it’s so annoying at the same time. 🤨 I used to love Snapchat but I think I’m going to delete it.
The new design is absolutely horrible. Snapchat should listen to their users and redesign to have stories and snaps on separate pages. Everything feels so clustered and squeezed together. Overall a very unaesthetic update, in natural feeling and sloppy.
I don’t know who they hire and told them to use this new time line but they need to get their money back ASAP plus interest. I hate the whole look. Nothing is smooth about it. Change it back before you lose more people. IG WAS BAD BUT THESE IS FAR WORSE.
Snapchat it’s just not doing it for me anymore. Like after this new, new update to “help customize and make things easier” you somehow MADE IT WORSE and MORE CONFUSING than the original update it self!! Just keep the multiple captions option and go back to before these updates. Like are you even listening to us? These updates are trash. Not only that, but after I turned my automatic updates off I took a nap and MY APP UPDATED!!! HOW?! These updates are ruining the app and the app ratings. I would give it negative stars if I could
I am saying goodbye. And you know why! 🖕
I wasn’t going to write a review until I saw that a spokesperson said their goal was to make Snapchat more “personal”. What, exactly, is your definition of personal? Because I find it impossible to find a lot of people that I know stories, and people who’s stories I loved to watch in general. Responding to people is now a pain in the a** because every time I open a snap, it moves under my unopened snaps. When I swipe right to look at stories, I’m bombarded by articles and celebrities I don’t even want to see. Navigating through the articles is almost impossible considering if I accidentally close it, things move around or my place in the article moves. Also, interacting with ads and sponsored content is cool and all, but when I accidentally move forward and can’t find it again when I try to move back, I get pretty frustrated. This new design is absolutely horrible. It makes no sense. I understand that the company may have wanted this to work, but it doesn’t. I definitely haven’t been using Snapchat as much since this new update, and I until things are cleared up a little on this app, I probably won’t be using it as much either. This was once my favorite app, and I’m sad to say that it no longer is. I’ve returned to using Facebook and Instagram more often. I would love to return to using Snapchat as often as I used to, but I can’t bring myself to deal with the frustration. Please consider everyone’s responses to this new update, as you guys are losing users who have been around since the beginning.
Ok, first off like I love snapchat. I’ve been using it since it came out. I usually had really laggy problems when I had my iphone 6. But now that I have my iphone 8 plus, like it’s so laggy. I thought it was the phone but it was snapchat all along. Please fix.
Ever since the update my Snapchat crashes frequently sometimes I’ll open snap an it’ll say I have no friends or not memories !!
Seems as if this app is reaching its own capacity every time I upload to me videos within a day they take forever to post and then eventually delete before ever actually posting the app also crashes a lot more now that I use it a lot more this is irritating Snapchat developers what can you do to fix this lately the app didn’t stay open long enough for me to shake it and let you guys know what’s going on through the app
I could not be more disappointed in this new update!! What kind of app updates BY ITSELF without my permission?? The algorithm is trash and always predicts that the wrong stories that I care about. Thank god I'm not the only one that is forcing myself to use Instagram as a big “fuck you” to Snapchat.
I understand you guys need to make more money or something by advertising but why not just add another section to the right instead of forcing advertisements? Voluntary action will produce much better results than force. Grammar is terrible but food for thought. Deleting this now
This new update is wack. It needs to go back to normal!!!
The app is almost useless now, thanks.
BRING BACK THE OLD SNAOCHAT. We follow people for a REASON! Now it’s impossible to find their story. Come onnnnn!
Snapchat used to be my most used and favorite app. Then we got the new update, I strongly dislike it. My main snapchat screen goes out of order, it’s not organized anymore. It used to be in order by time and it was easy to see everything. Then the stories got all unorganized too, I really miss the old snapchat. Definitely do not like this app anymore :((
Change the update back to normal !!!
BRING BACK THE OLD SNAPCHAT!!! THIS UPDATE IS HORRIBLE AND CONFUSING PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD UPDATE
I truly hate snapchat for this update like i lost all my streaks i barely go on snap anymore bcs of the way it’s made now
The new update is terrible. I’m all about change sometimes, but I do not enjoy the update. I want my old version back, and as a high school aged girl I have started to use Snapchat less due to the changes from the update. PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK!!
The new update is horrible with the stories If they put the stories back the way they were the app would be better they can keep everything else but put the stories back to the way they were
I know that u guys spent a lot of time on the update but seriously turn it back plz unless u like all the hate no one likes it all I’m saying is plz plz plz turn it back soon just don’t think hate is good plz😭😭😭
snapchat has literally changed its whole outlook and I’m about to delete it. i don’t even get some of my notifications until days later which REALLY is annoying, and i can’t see people’s stories as easy. i hate how people i don’t even talk to are in my recents too. it’s so messy & glitches way too much and if it doesnt change back i’ll probably stop using it for good.
Snapchat was cool before the new update
Trash after the latest updates
Just got the new update. Good in theory but we have always slid over to open the chats and now it’s just confusing and even more hard to use. Not to mention crowded still. More so now that the story and group slides are there.
Hey Snapchat, I was wondering if you can take this request in consideration. Everyone nowadays uses the filter with the hearts. So why not have the same filter but without the hearts, it would be amazing and everyone would use it. So why not?
if you know people dont like the new update dont make it worse
Bring back the old interface. I haven’t been using snap like I used to because of this terrible update.
So is it going to get fixed or ... ?
New update is very bad feels like I’m about to fly a spaceship useing it
Title says it all
I absolutely love snapchat, the idea of it and everything was executed perfectly, then the newest update And well feeling like everyone else, why snap, why 
The update made everything more complicated, slower, and makes snaps send to the wrong people. When you open it and it refreshes, the streak people aren’t at the top and they’re way down at the bottom. Stories are not even worth it to watch since they’re on the same organization by most recent story. Plus the discover tab on the right is really just pointless. If I wanted to watch celebrity stories, I would’ve added them.
They need to reverse this update because I hate everything about it is is not as well functioning and it didn’t even fix any of the previous issues it only made the app worse. Considered deleting it.
I hate the new update so much. I think I mightjust quit this app ugghh!!
I was always a fan of the updates, till now. It is so hard to find my recents on my Snapchat now. It’s all very cluttered and very messy.
The app functions fine. The update isn't my favorite, but what would vastly improve my rating is an option of sorting who you see. I'm assuming it sorts by story now? I don't actually look at many's stories, but I do talk to those I talk a lot to. Before it sorted by who you talked to last. Now, someone I talked to 10 minutes ago is suddenly halfway down my friends. A simple option to choose how to sort would be fine.
You know how Pokémon Go was doing incredibly well until Niantic changed it’s features and then everyone dropped it like a hot potato? Just pointing it out, Snapchat. Sometimes change isn’t for the best.
Please please please! Just go back to the old update!
I love Snapchat so much it is such a great way to interact! The update is very confusing and hard to get used to, but it isn’t that bad. The basic use of this app is to send pictures back and forth with friends. The app makes it fun though using things like filters and stickers! There is also ways to FaceTime and call on there, but there very laggy. If you need to send a quick message and don’t feel like taking a picture great there’s a just chat mode kind of like texting! You can post on you’re story and make it to where all of you’re friends can see and comment on you’re photo or video! If you Snapchat someone for 3 days straight it starts a streak which pops up at the end not the right side it will go up the more you snap everyday! The more friends the better you’ll get a higher snap score (this really doesn’t matter though). Bitmoji is a huge part of Snapchat now it is a custom made avatar of you it is a separate app but it links up to you’re snap and has filters, stickers, and emojis, it also shows it on the very left side to show who you are with you’re name an everything! I really do recommend this app it is worth the download!
i don't like how the chronological order thing is different now but that's ok. … well it was. it didn't really matter cause i could just swipe right on their name so that i would respond immediately after opening their snap. now when i swipe right it goes to stories/groups.  suggestion: make it so we can still swipe right to open chat but can swipe to stories if we put our fingers at the top. 
Loved this app but it went down hill honestly, it’s not the same
Gimme the old Snapchat🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
Bring the old Snapchat back.
PLEASE GIVE US BACK THE OLD SNAPCHAT!!!!! I want it back you just updated again and it’s still terrible. I have to press the circles instead of the names. Please please bring the old one back.
I’m glad the seperatedthe stories and snaps, but I wish you could still clear your conversations and still see people’s stories, what was so wrong with Snapchat before that made it need these stupid updates?
Not a fan of the update at all.
This new update is absolute trash. Everyone wants the old Snapchat back.  Y’all really messed up this time lol 
Snapchat...Idk who told y’all to literally flip snap upside down bc idek what I be looking at when I get on bc im so confused, ITS SO UGLY NOW I HATE the fact that I can’t scroll to the left and see my regular snap messages instead I see stories, which y’all really screwed be over with that because I have like 500 people on Snapchat and I DONT EVEN KNOW WHOSE SNAP STORIES BE THERE WHEN I SCROLL LEFT BECAUSE ITS NOT THE PEOPLE I WANT TO SEE, I don’t even scroll to the right because the discovery tab is UGLY full of celebrities I’m not interesting in so now I can’t even find the ones I am interested in, PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK SPEAKING ON THE BEHALF OF EVERYONE PLUS KYLIE JENNER, y’all Average rate is a 1.8 now before this update y’all was a 4. Something....think about it...and do yourself a favor Snapchat
Super cluttered ! Everything is jumbled on one page and it's now easy to miss group stories and such.
Y’all should seriously give us back the old version. This update is the dumbest thing ever. If our friends stories is on their Bitmoji thing then their is little to no reason to swipe right on the app. Think about that plz and decide if u wanna change that atleast.
The more it updates the worse it gets
Please get the snap chat back to normal fr
This new update is trash. I delete the conversation to have only my closest friends on the page and a day later everyone who posted a story pop up. No. My closest friends sometimes don’t pop up on the top so finding them is painful to look for them. Also y’all trash. Yes I’m hating and using the app. But if y’all don’t change quick some other app will pop up with a better layout and gives the people what they want and y’all will end up like vine. So listen to the people.
i have been loving snapchat for the longest time, but after the update everything became so unorganized. First off I am so annoyed   of seeing hourglasses next to  my streaks when we have both sent each other something in the past 24 hrs and then having the streak disappear all of a sudden. Second off when I want to talk to someone that I have just been talking to they end up going to the bottom right after I open them making it a huge hassle. Third I hate how the stories are as of right now it makes things more difficult.
The new update and layout is just trash. There’s no way to go back and watch popular stories and if there is a way, it’s super hard and using SC shouldn’t be hard. The popular stories always get lost in other stories and those articles. If I wanna go back and watch a story from the popular page, I couldn’t be able to do that in a reasonable amount of time. Everything is just extra now. Can we please just go back to the old one?
I can’t tell the difference between a story and a personal snap. Bring back the old version please!
This tweak is better that I can see just a page of stories, and that subscriptions are separate from that whole mess of a page. But I'm still having a hard time telling someone's snap story from them sending me a snap directly. Make a separate page for stories and another for snaps/chats.
this new “update” is literally the worst thing you could do to the app... you’re killing the popularity of the app. NO ONE likes it. Change it back immediately.
Snapchat is definitely lame now. Ever since I updated the new version. Some of my friends have deleted the app. No one goes on it, or enjoys it anymore!!! 👎🏼
I don’t like the new update. It’s not good and you really can’t see people story . Need to go back to the old way
Your app can’t be #1 when every other photo and video app have higher reviews than you. Fix your app go back to the old version I might think about downloading it again
Jesus Devs, when are you gonna start listening to your consumers rather than your yesmen?
This new update is terrible... please go back to the old version.
bring old snapchat software back asap
This app use to be great. I could stay up to date with my friend's stories and everything on the latest news. Now its just a cluttered mess. Anytime i try to have a conversation with someone i get irritated now. If i get a notification for a snap and people update their story, the snap notification gets shoved to the bottom and its impossible to find. SEPARATE THE STORIES FROM THE CONVERSATIONS!!!  I can never seem to find all the stories from the people i follow. Half are in the chat area, and the other half are in the discover area. YOU CANT VIEW A STORY AFTER YOUVE ALREADY SEEN IT. I think its part is ridiculous since the story stays up for 24 hours anyway. I use to rewatch my friends stories all the time.  Snapchat, please go back to how the display use to be. Listen to the countless number of reviews that are all based on this last update. You guys really messed up this time 
App is trash !
What did y’all do to that pretty filter. I need that back in my life.
change the update back!
Everyone will be happy if you just get rid of this dumb update i don’t like that i can’t swipe into a chat anymore that’s dumb to get rid of now you’re forced to open a snap from someone before you can see anything in the chat part plus everything looks cluttered and less aesthetically pleasing.
Garbage
There wasn’t a need to make Snapchat the way it is now... CHANGE BACK!!!
I love Snapchat, it’s fun and I don’t really mind the new update and how it looks and all that but I CANT GET THE NEW FONTS AND CRAP!!!! I’ve tried uninstalling it then reinstalling it like a million times and I still don’t have them. It’s really starting to annoy me. Other than that I love it. So keep up the good work
The new update is horrible. It’s confusing at times and is just plain out bad. The stories now in my feed is not even from people I follow. I want the old update back as much as everyone else. Plus Snapchat updated by its self.
Keep conversations and stories SEPARATE! Also, no one cares about the Discover section. Make that optional viewing.
all i have to say is that i loved snapchat. definitely my #1 app. until they updated it and now u can’t find stories, get confused and just don’t like it. it’s still functional but definitely needs to be changed.
Whenever I open up the app or even try to take a picture the app automatically crashes and/or goes black. Please fix this bug, other than that this app is good.
The new Snapchat update is completely awful the only reason I gave 1 star was because we couldn’t give zero,this new Snapchat update makes it harder and more confusing to enjoy the app while talking to your friends it’s way to busy for just one page for the stories and the chats
The update ruined the stories. Completed stopped using Snapchat. Thanks snap for making me hate your good app. Also any one that gives this app 2 stars is prolly getting paid!
Literally just swallow your dang pride and undo the freaking update
I think the newest update is alright. When I go on maps it just takes me out of the app.
Snapchat is so boring now I hate the app I’m going to delete it.
To who ever is reading this I don’t like the new update it makes everything so confusing to use and I can’t see my own story without bring my whole thing up and I don’t like that I have Jacob Sartorius as one of the home pages to see their story and I don’t have my friends and it’s really hard to see who texted me because it changes so please Snapchat bring he old one back 😕
I have my automatic updates turned off for a reason, and I’d been able to avoid this update for a little over a week. BUT THEN OUT OF THE BLUE, I open my app and the whole layout has gone to sh*t. The plague that is the new Snapchat invited itself into my phone. Babies cried. Someone was crying in the corner. I could hear screams in the distance. World War III and the Zombie Apocalypse began simultaneously.   But seriously, it’s so cluttered! I’m forced to look at everyone’s new stories - people I don’t really care about [but obviously can’t unfriend because that opens another can of worms]. It is unnecessarily cluttered.  All I ask is that my personal snaps stay in their corner, and stories stay in their corner. We can be happily separate - LIKE IT WAS BEFORE. 
I’m not a fan of the new format, that is all.
The update is not bad. It takes adjusting, it’s hard to satisfy every consumer. Functionally the app does everything it’s ever done and more. We must learn to adapt people.
I know snapchat thinks people will forget about this update or get used to it BUT the difference is no one literally no one likes this update. There’s usually a few people that do, but not this time. It’s cluttered, confusing, and all together messy. It’s time for Snapchat to stop making excuses and listen to the people that are the reasons they have jobs and paychecks... stop saying you don’t care! Social media is a volatile environment and this update is taking your app out of what’s in and throwing it into what’s out. Do better market research next time
yea hello snapchat creators, I don’t know if you have been paying attention or not, but what is this new update. We want the old one back with out the faces and the stories and snaps on one page. We want the old snapchat back and by the way it is a lot slower now. Please give your users what they want, the old version back.
CHANGE IT BACK FFS
The new layout for stories is absolute garbage. It’s confusing, unorganized, cluttered, and flat-out stupid. Fix it.  Update: usually with app style changes as time goes on people get used to it, and continue using the app as per usual. With Snapchat’s update this is not that case. I hate it more than ever. 
This update makes it feel cluttered and not pleasant when you try to talk to your friends in a cool way by filters or bitmoji. Now it's just not fun. Please please please consider to remove the update. Like come on, everyone is saying it's cluttered. So just remove the update. I would give this a 5 star rating but ever since the update at the highest I will give you guys a 2 star rating.   Thanks for ruining a fun and easy way to talk to your friends. I also heard a rumor about ending streaks. Like are you trying to get people to delete this app? I'm going to delete this app if you don't remove this update. I know I am being a little harsh but it's the truth so deal with it.  But besides the update everything is going well. Really no glitches. It's a stable app. Plus the filters are looking snazzy:) thank you for reading this!! 
used to be such a good app but the new stories page is so bad, it’s just another way of showing ads and unrelated people that you’re not interested in (if i was, i’d have them added already lol). change snap inbox back to chronological order instead of disappearing from the top of the list after you open it?
I used to love Snapchat until they decided to come up with a new layout. The older version is so much easier, and I don’t understand why they would keep it for so long seeing how many complaints they have and how their reviews went down.
I never thought a social media app would take such a strong stance against the 2nd amendment of the bill of rights and make insane anti NRA advertisements. I’m not a trump supporter but it seems he is right about the media with this coming from Snapchat. This was a messaging app, keep politics off of it.  P.S. the nra was founded for marksmanship of Americans, and now is the biggest influence to firearm safety putting out every class for firearm safety 
My snapchat says that its updated but I don't have the multiple fonts and texts
please stop updating and adding more stuff! my snapchat has never been so laggy and slow before 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ i know it’s not my wifi because the wifi i have is always super strong. stop it!!
Give me the old snap back. It didnt need fixed it wasnt broken and now it’s just stupid and hard to use. TRASH
I can’t believe they switched the formatting on Snapchat. I haven’t used it since. It needs to go back.
I used to love snapchat, it was like my favorite app! But now, I dislike it. The snap chat team says they would bring back the original update and ditch the new one February 20th, but that never happened. Snapchat just gets complicated with the new update and honestly, I actually and contemplating on deleting it.
Snapchat should add a streaks list option ! Most people on Snapchat have a ton of streaks and if there was a button created to sent out streaks life would just be easier! Most people at the moment just put a emoji or a sign to keep their streak list and have to scroll to find the list. Like I said before if this streaks list button was made then it could easily send out streaks without a problem!
I am honestly really upset that Snapchat updated the app. I was enjoying it and now it is unorganized. I just hate it how the stories are now on the chat side and I can only see stories from the people I actually talk to. And also when people Snapchat me now it’s hard to see if they did because the red square is so hard to see. I think that you should bring the old Snapchat back because the new update isn’t like Snapchat at all.
New update trash 🤦‍♂️
I HATE IT!!! It's all complex and it's not good. GO BACK SNAPCHAT!!! 
How you know snapchat is losing money is they have to trick you to click on their shlt. Discover page.
Horrible app. Very unorganized. Used to be easy to use not anymore. Starting to get into instagram its easier to view .
This update is 🤢🤢🤢
Needs to be fixed. The screen is cluttered with useless details. They need to keep it clean and simple.
Bad
Go back
the new update is bad 😑👎
I absolutely hate it. For starters everything is now so slow and glitchy, Snapchat was working perfectly fine then this mess cams out. The format is horrible, y’all need to work on this bring back the original format please!! I’m deleting the app until further notice.
This app is great and it is now my only form of communication but this new update has made it very confusing and I like the idea but I agree with other reviewers that I'm not a fan of the layout itself just my opinion.
This update was bad but now it’s HORRIBLE. I’m losing a streak everyday WITH me snapping them within the 24 hour aspect, which I don’t understand why they are disappearing! Something NEEDS to be done like NOW
If you don’t want your app irrelevant by 2020 then I suggest y’all go back to the old format. After the Kylie Jenner incident I hope y’all realize this ain’t a game no more.
.....y’all.....  this update is so bad. please take it back, we don’t want it. 
When will Snapchat go back?  I don’t know how much longer I can take it.
The update is horrible!!! I mean the old way was so much better! And please make it able so I can delete conversations and not everything? I don’t any to individually unsafe 6 years worths of snaps
alrighty so i love snapchat, i use it everyday! i like looking at peoples stories to see what they want to share with the world, i like snapping back and forth with ugly pictures with my friends and i like using the filters. but the new snapchat update makes snapchat feel cluttered. the old snapchat was way easier to see everything and control. the new update makes it hard to find things and it feels like everything is in one spot. please change it, snapchat! i know thousands of people HATE the update and would like it to revert back to it’s old format.
Seriously snapchat, please just change back to the old version. No one likes the new version!
I’m done with snapchat you ruined it with that dumb update
trash update is inconvenient
Could be better
The new update doesn’t allow you to slide left to start or view a conversation anymore, you have to load the photo or video before you can view the chat. It’s annoying seeing the stories how they are and the group chat. Please bring back the prior version please.
I really hate the new update. As in I literally cannot find a single thing I like about it. Please change it back! Wait, I do like that I can have a story for just my friends now. There’s one thing.
I LOVE THE APP, BUT EVER SINCE THE LATEST UPDATE CAME OUT MY SNAP KEEPS ON CRASHING WHENEVER I TRY TO TAKE A PICTURE.
Snap is great. But the new update is horrible. It could take us a longggg time to get used to.
It’s awful after that last update. I’m not enjoying it anymore and definitely using it less. I feel disconnected and I’m considering deleting it
This layout and feature set in this update sucked so much I actually went on to write a review. Please fix this crap screen that is miserably unintuitive and non user friendly.
The new Snapchat update makes everything more confusing it was just fine before it was updated all weird please change it back to the old version the update is just getting worse
I really don’t like this update and I know I don’t see everyone’s story like I used to. I don’t want stories in two different places that’s really stupid...
Why even update this app when it’s crap now lol
this snapchat update is honestly stupid and you guys need to bring back the old snapchat because this new update isn’t working. it’s messing with my streaks and i don’t understand how to cooperate with this update, it’s making my brain hurt. BRING THE OLD SNAP BACK!
This new version is terrible guys how can I even see my friends stories? Please stop trying to fix what is not broken. You guys are already rich. Please stop trying these weird ideas.
terrible. absolutely horrendous
Regardless of all the backlash you guys have gotten since the latest update, you STILL won’t change it back. I don’t get it. I still can barely locate some of my friends to watch their snaps. I have to literally navigate through my whole list of friends (which is a lot) just to find certain people. You guys can’t see everyone HATES THIS? Fix it!
I love the new update... I don’t understand why everyone says it’s confusing. Discover section was condensed from two pages to one page, stories, friends, and conversations can be found in one area which makes more sense, everything just makes more sense and is easier to access and view. I like that it tells you whose story you’re viewing before just playing the next story, I like that you can break it down into stories, groups, or all friends/everything, I like the new Bitmoji styles, I like it all. I hated the last major update, but I definitely think this one has changed things for the better.
This app used to be great but now they don’t listen to their customers.
We need the old update back . With the new update no one can get views and no one knows how to work it 👎🏼 .
God i hate the new update
Thanks Snapchat now I can’t find my daily news and everything is so complicated
The app was amazing until the update happened, it’s so hard to snap back to everyone.
This update is awful. Please, bring the old one back.   #bringoldspback 
this app takes wayyyyy too much battery and data. which i was ok with, until it changed. like you changed the ENTIRE app. you didn’t even give the users a chance to contemplate wether or not they wanted the update. you decided for us. not to be rude, but that is something a dictator would do. dictators don’t ask the people, they do whatever they want on their own time.  thank you,                  krista🌟 
Worst decision ever, can’t believe executives are that naive to make a decision like this. The new update is terrible period.
Look what you’ve done. No one wanted this update. Ever sense the update, your shining 4 start rating came down to a freaking 1.8.
I don’t need to write an essay because everyone’s saying the same thing already, but you guys screwed up the whole app. The format isn’t far from user friendly, it’s too much to scroll through, too hard to find people you wanna see through the discover page BS you’ve added, and I will NEVER understand y’all or Instagram thinking it’s best to stay away from chronological order. Nobody wants to see content out of order. So why the hell would you change it
Bring back the old Snapchat !!! The new update is downright terrible and confusing to use. It’s basically a useless app when u can’t even find out how to navigate.   Why are my friends out of order on my news feed? When I Snapchat my friends I want them in the order that I last talked to them. I don’t like how Snapchat automatically “shuffles” them 
Ok so the update sucked. And the most recent one sucked even more. You can’t just easily swipe to get to the chat. Instead you have to hole down their name and press chat. The huge update sucked. I want the old snap back!
Why change something that was already good! Now I have trouble sending my snaps cause they just delete going to the trash bin. Like why even add this stupid feature. People didn’t complain about deleting the words. Quit making dumb updates!
Trash
The update is so gosh darn awful I feel like I’m trying to read the instruction to setting up a new television when accidentally only being sent the Russian translation. The way to view stories is so painful that my masochist friend opens the app for his own fun. And somehow someone from my high school that I know’s story won’t even show up on the dang screen but he shows up on the public story section??? Didn’t know he was a celebrity. Oh and if you want to view a story again after opening it and you don’t remember who’s it was?? Oh boy, it’s like trying to determine which snowman Dwight is hiding in bc they just disappear and you gotta scroll all the way down to the fourth circle of hell to see if the person maybe has one. I’d rather eat a whole bag of Haribo sugar-free gummy bears than use the freaking app another day the way that it is. Instagram is gunna just be the new way we communicate, and absorb the snapchatting qualities of Snapchat just like they did with stories. Hope your 1.8 stars were worth it, Spiegel.
The new update is worse
this update is awful. please change it back.
biggest mistake in snapchat history!
I absolutely do not like not being able to have a separation between stories and Snapchat stories. One of my favorite things about Snapchat was the fact that you could send messages where you could open them and show whether or not they were read- however I liked this because you could scroll the screen over a little and read the message without actually opening It. Now, the slightest swipe will change the screen to “stories”. I love Snapchat but I would hate to get rid of It because the updates made It much less sufficient
i really love snapchat but i have a suggestion why don’t y’all make a stories tab but just stories and than the chats just chats no one story poping up and the chats with chats it gets pretty annoying that people’s stories just pop up in the chats
Edit:While home gesture heat disabled on the iPhone X when scrolling on discovery like really   I like that Friends are separated. Would like  to see more popular snaps in the Discover page than Publishers and news  . This app so much better compared to IG, I don’t have videos playing automatic and audio playing all over while I listen to music. Instagram is a mess their app is 💩 compared to how fast and smooth this app is 
Snapchat was my most used and favorite social media source to converse with my friends. when the app was updated, i was actually one of the few people that said they didn’t mind it. It wasn’t until now that i realized i had convinced myself i loved the new update, when in reality, i hate it. Looking at the new format, at first, WAS fun and interesting. But just now, as i was replying back to my best friend snap, i really (and i mean REALLY) looked at the format for the first time; this time, i realized how much i missed the old layout and how popular it use to be. i wish they would change it back
It’s a good app to use but they need to stop trying to force people who don’t want to update to update even when your auto-updates are already off in your settings!! 😡😡😡
I used to love this app, now with the update, not so much. I wish I could give zero stars instead of one😭
still waiting for that update reversal everyone's been talking bout cuz the new update actually gave everyone cancer so yeah
reverse the update back. it's stupid.
Please switch back. Couldn’t be less user friendly
now, i know you’ve received a lot of reviews about the new update. and to be honest, they aren’t wrong. it’s confusing, no one actually sees my story (or private one matter of fact), i can’t see others stories, my snapchat is all out of order and so much more. i don’t want to see these people’s stories! yeah, they’re my friends but i like to choose my stories. and when i am privately snapchatting people, i don’t want to see these random people whom i don’t usually contact. it messes everything up. FIX this update. make it back to the older version, where everyone knew how to use it.
I don’t really need to make this post because everyone else already knows the new Snapchat is horrible. But that’s why I’m here. It’s horrible and I hate it. I wish they would stop selling out to the horrible “news” companies that have taken over the app.
ok so first of all, updates by itself , now it seems like snapchat is times square which basically has ads!!!! All over the place where i was supposed to see MY FRIENDS and not just popular ramdom bull***** , also besides just having a alot of  popular stuff i dont want to see at all!, THERE’S EVEN MORE AND MORE ADS !, i get it snap LETS MAKE THIS AD MONEY CAUSE WHY NOT? , BUT SERIOUSLY WHERE IS THE APP ? ( ALL I SEE IS ADS AND ADS AND “”””POPULAR”””” snaps and more ADS, and friends or chats become less and less appealing.   Nice job , Advertising money is the way to go , but ENOUGH IS ENOUGH .  I guess i’ll be using snap once in a while   👍🏻  UPDATE : when is this going to be fixed? I use snap once or less a week now 
it was my fav but now the new update and how it looks stresses me out so. please fix that :/
❤️
The discover page is awful. I only watch my friends stories which are now mixed in with junk I don’t want to watch.
No notifications for any of the new messages I get.. this app is trash to me now.
I also used Snapchat everyday to talk and share pictures with my friends and family. It was easy to use and to navigate through. But now with the update, I feel like it’s hard to use and sometimes I can’t find my friends and family’s stories and I just don’t like how it works. It’s not that easy to use anymore. Hopefully soon the developers will figure this is something that needs to be fix.
Are you kidding me right now? This is ridiculous, everyone wants the update removed and put back to normal. YOUR APP IS LOSING MONEY. Come to your senses and fix this everyone hates the app now. You’re all being naive and thinking that people will get used to it. They won’t. So fix the update before you lose more money and I lose faith in the app.
It's been said but the update was trash. I really don't want to see the stories of degenerates like J Paul
Yooo what the heck this new update is mixing up from the recent people I talk to so when I go respond to someone on snap it's the wrong person..... this needs to fixed!!!
As a 30 something year old that used this to communicate with his wife and his wife's friends and a small group of my friends , your update has rendered this app useless to me. I don't want to see random people's stories? Why would a married guy want to view some THOT's Snapchat story? Did yall not product  test with any user groups?
snapchat is trash because of the new update. honestly just might delete it all together. the update ruins absolutely everything and everyone hates it. rip snapchat 2011-2018
Change this SH***T
Baaaaad update
The new update you just did with sectioning the stories didn’t do absolutely anything. It is still extremely disorganized not being in alphabetical order and where is your friends list at and how come I have all these random people mixed into the list of my recent snaps? This honestly is the worst. I have yet to post a story because it confuses the heck out of me. Enough with the smart technology of trying to show what you think I wanna see. NO. Let me choose what I want to see by making it easy to find what I am looking for myself.
Once again this update is absolutely terrible. I managed to avoid updating it for 3 weeks after everyone else told me how awful this new update is. However, my phone finally automatically updated it without me doing so myself.  This update is the last thing from innovative. I can no longer find the celebrities I follow, at least not easily. It also makes it so I see celebrities I DON’T follow, nor want to follow, in my feed. I hardly want to use the app anymore, which is unfortunate because I use it daily.  Long story short, please revert back to how it was. This was a bad decision. 
“I hate the new update” says everyone including me! Why would they change the layout when the old one was working just fine. I rarely use any other social media app besides this one. It’s making me not want to use social media at all! What’s up with all these apps wanting to show you things out of order that’s DUMB. I don’t want to see what someone posted last night or a day ago i want to see most recent FIRST that makes sense. Someone dropped the ball with this. The worst move Yhall could have made
so snapchat was the most amazing app EVER but then came along this NEW update and what a complete let down. one Star rating nothing more simple as that. I'm comfortable with change but this is not the time for it, all other synonyms that come to mind with snapchat, Trash!
Can’t find friends stories. Nothing is in order. Snapchat is too stubborn to listen to the people and revert to the basics. Why try to improve on something that is already perfect the way it is. It’s like when movies create 10 sequels. Shoulda stopped at 2. GO BACK TO THE BASICS or you will lose a majority of your customer base. Would not recommend this app anymore
I love Snapchat and use it daily but this will no longer be because of the new update. Please change it back to the original way!!! Why fix something that isn't broken???
Please go back to old layout
This update is literally just an abortion. That’s the only word I can think of to describe it.
I used to LOVE snap it was my favorite app but now i’m considering deleting it. i hate the update. it’s cluttered and very unorganized. It’s so hard to use and I hate it. sorry but i’m probably going to delete it.
Please bring the old Snapchat back the latest updates are so useless and I’m sure I’m not the only one that dislikes it. I will uninstall app if there is no change made !
I’ve always liked Snapchat and liked the simplicity of it and how it is easy to scroll around the app.  The new update just makes my Snapchat a mess and hard to maneuver.  Having streaks is also made harder because of this.  You guys are great I love this app, I just wish it was back to what it used to be. It’s been a while since the update and I still and very upset about it.  I will not be happy with Snapchat until it’s fixed.
i still use snap to stay updated on things at school or interact with friends but i don’t enjoy it anymore. the new setup is harder to navigate and is more time consuming. Your rating have dropped tremendously and they aren’t getting better guys. I suggest you reverse the update. Don’t be stubborn.
I use to like Snapchat and would use it on a somewhat daily basis but after the newest update I pretty much quit using it all together. I absolutely hate he new update and wish I could undo it.
Ever since the update, I don't use snapchat as much. I'm not able to communicate with my friends like I used to. Everything on the app is confusing. I wish that maybe, just maybe everything could go back to how it used to be.
This new update is very confusing...And I don’t care to see all these people i don’t know on the discover feed....
Snapchat was most most fav app and now i hate its hard to navigate and very confusing. They should go back to the old ways.
This is by far the worst update snapchat has done,they should really just keep it the old way and see who's best friends with who instead of changing how you can't even see how many snaps you have on the camera screen👎👎👎 also the the new stories is by far the dumbest think I’ve seen also how recently you snap someone doesn’t help at all because they’ll be all the way at the bottom so way to play yourself Snapchat,ratings have gone down,people hate it and barely use the app only for emergencies,and it’s not the way we like it it’s the way you like it.
The current version of snapchat is less than satisfactory. I don’t care to see all of the buzz feeds or celebrity snaps that I don’t follow so why are they always flashed on my feed? I don’t understand how come I can’t control what’s on my feed. The “discovery” tab now controls the feed and finding my friends snaps are more difficult... I think my snap days are coming to an end.
They need to change the update no one likes it 😬
Con una actualización arruinaron todo...
Please change Snapchat back how it use to be I'm really getting annoyed of how people stories pop up on my conversation log.
Terrible changes to the story system, ads are gradually getting more invasive, and banned for 24 hours? Said I was using a third party app to access snapchat? I'm not entirely sure what a 3rd party app is, much less do I ever use anything other than regular Snapchat from the appstore. Even worse my friend was banned permanently, would not recommend downloading until some changes are made. I r8 0/8
So I’ve been getting a lot of very strange crashes and I have the IPhone 8 which is fairly new and I don’t know why I’ve been getting crashes. So if you could get some bugs fixed or if their is a glitch that you could patch, that would be awesome!!
Although I loooooove the app, the newest update is trash. It was more like a downgrade instead of an upgrade
Trash thanks snap.
is a nightmare that scrambled the basic functionality of the app. It's now confusing to use, they know no one likes it, and they're refusing to acknowledge that. Frustrating.
It runs smooth but the new update lagged it out
:the new update
I have been using Snapchat since I was thirteen years old. I don’t like this update at all!!!!! Everything is different, I barely get any views on my posts because no one can see my story, and it’s showing me random people’s snap stories that I DO NOT follow. I don’t like this update Snapchat PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK OR IM DELETING IT FOR GOOD JUST LIKE KYLIE!
bad app. deleting
Complete trash. The update is absolutely horrible and messed up. Good job Snapchat
i literally can’t use snapchat anymore because of the update. it is aweful.
i don’t like 🤕
I hate snapchat I was on it everyday and then they updated it and now I hate it so much I stoped using it so unless they take back the update I will be elsewhere
I liked Snapchat before and thought it was a fun way to stay connected with friends, and I also liked the discover page because you could subscribe to what you *actually wanted to see*, not other, unorganized stuff that is always mixed up. I also don't like the act that now Snapchat is showing random celebrities sc stories on the discover page. Idgaf about them; if I wanted to see their story, I'd follow them on sc.
sis we just want the old snapchat back
it’s so cluttered. i wish i could give 0 stars. maybe a half a star to be generous..
The bs update got me caught up with my girl smh.
This update is horrible! On the side where you usually have your friends stories there’s other people’s stories I didn’t even add. There’s like Alissa Violet, Patrick Starr etc. I didn’t ask to see their stories!!! And the side where you have the people to text it’s their stories on top of their bitmoji. It’s so hard if I want to see their story again! I’m so unhappy! PLEASE change it!!!!
Snapchat needs to go back to the original way before all these crappy updates its going down hill from there 🤦🏽‍♀️
Update made it very bad
When a company has a product they want people to use but won’t listen to the people, the company will die. I know the ceo just got a 700 million dollar bonus so he doesn’t care what happens to the company from here.  But you’re losing people every day.
Yeah no we still hate the update.
I love Snapchat a lot and I use it every day a lot but ever since the new update I lose a lot of streaks because I can not find people’s snap hat I opened and the new update is super harder to use
I see the point of the new update, but not only is the cluttered mess making it hard to use, but every time I check my streaks, it says they are gone or it has an hourglass by it. It’s ridiculous and completely stupid. After all of these reviews, Snapchat should really consider their next move.
Please bring back the old version, this new platform is absolutely atrocious. The old platform was well worth 5+ stars.   Sincerely,  An avid user, that may start to only use a an unnamed big competitor. 
Okay so I’ve been using Snapchat for a while now but it’s This one filter that everyone seems to have but me it’s the one where it says like “Hayley’s Saturday “ the date n time with the t.v like imaging I can’t describe but I really want it but I’m not understanding how I don’t have when my Snapchat is up to date.
I don’t like the new update!
Worst app ever with this dumb update do not recommend it at all
Ok so this update is seriously wack, it’s so unintuitive and why make it so difficult to watch people’s stories who may not post often? Becoming increasingly frustrated with Snapchat and their frickin’ dumb updates, keep the platform the same and just add cool stuff don’t jumble up everything and make me relearn how to use your app every 2 months. 😡
It was my favorite app but after the last update super disappointed!
This app is fugly as cheese.
Update is terrible why do i have to view people’s story that i follow in two different places ??? It makes no sense !
Snapchat takes up mad storage but the update is better for messaging and subscriptions sorry just my opinion
New update makes it crash and freeze
Wow, Snapchat messed it up with that one. It used to be so much easier to navigate without it. Now it’s frustrating asf and I don’t even know these people😒.
Update is horrible
Snapchat has been my main way of communicating with friends for years, I use it every day, but this update has literally shattered my prescription of Snapchat as a whole. It went from being convenient and familiar to frustrating. I can’t even secretly slide over and read a message without opening it anymore. I can’t always find the subscribed stories I like to read even though I am subscribed to them all. Someone told me to uninstall and install the app again to get rid of the update. My phone has almost no storage space left so it takes time for me to download anything at the moment. I did it though and I waited and I was prepared to wait hours to have the old Snapchat back. Didn’t work. Please, someone, fix this mess. Everyone hates the update. I’ve yet to read one positive review even though the reviews are “”””””””””mixed””””””””””.
I don’t like the new update
Snapchat used to be easy to access. The new update puts stories and snaps together on one page. Awful update.
I turned off automatic updates so I wouldn’t get this garbage and now I’m mad. All of the celebrities I followed are gone, and from reading news articles Snapchat doesn’t even care. I can’t even tell when my friends have new updates to their stories. Instagram already had a lot of cool features, and with them I can follow the people I want.
I'm just going to keep this simple. The new update is terrible. I don't know why you guys had to change it like that when there was nothing wrong with it at all. It makes everything look all cluttered up. Once I heard everyone saying that the update was terrible I decided not to update it. But guess what it did it anyway. Like what the hell. I also don't understand why your not changing the app back. You know everyone hates it now so change it back the way it was already. Is it that freaking hard?
Ever since the update happened i have not used snapchat. Which is a disappointment because i would frequently used what was once my favorite app. Even Kylie Jenner announced she no longer uses snapchat. So I suggest you fix it now.
Loved the app but the new format blows, I loved having a section separate from my conversations dedicated to watching story’s, very disappointing and kinda bummed the app updated without my consent
New layout totally made this app is the worst update ever. ✌🏼
it succs so much, I don't like it, I'm finna delete this heckin app if you don't make it good again
Please change it back !!! It’s so hard to navigate and to clustered ! Please Please Please change it back !!! Also it crashes and closes at least once a day and it keeps doing it unless I restart my phone then it does the same thing the next day .
When we switching back to the old snapchat?
We want the old update !!!
Well I’m just going to say it the update is a f*cked up piece of sh¡t that nobody likes why’d you do this Why’d you do this Why’d you do this Way to go Snapchat updating something that really didn’t need to be updated at the time and then changing the format which has happened more than once and is the equivalent to having the same in-laws 3 times in a row.(you can figure that one out by yourself) 
Snapchat don’t care bout our opinions🤷🏽‍♀️y’all getting 1 star ratings Nd made it worse‼️finna delete
Hate the update
Snapchat was great until this new update came out plz get the old update back
One of how many millions who HATE this app with the current update? Please fix this.
Ever since they took out the stories tab, Snapchat has H U M O N G O U S  G A Y. I hate it
You guys just keep making Snapchat worse
So I was FORCED to have the update (which is just a jumbled mess) and thought I would just get used to it.... NOPE. I’ve had the update for a few weeks now and I’m still SO confused. Sorry Snapchat, nobody likes this update. Change it back before you lose even more money.
I hate the new Snapchat! please bring back the old one!!!!
I can’t find anybodies snap that I actually like to watch. It’s just seem like everything is cluttered into one screen.
Update just feels jumbled, unorganized & unnecessary. Definitely love upgrades but this one is a NO from me.
The newest update is awful. Go back to the way it was before
I love Snapchat and use it almost everyday. It’s fun to snap and talk to my friends but also make new ones. But since the update it’s a lot more difficult to use the app and see stories. I don’t even use it that often anymore. I would like the old Snapchat back.
Why didn’t the update you guys Justa came out with change the format back to the way it was. Your rating have dropped from pretty much 5 stars to 1.8 obviously there’s an issue. Fix it. No one likes this format, it’s a jumbled mess. I can’t see where my snaps are and I can’t find my recents because all of the stories are in the way. Please, on behalf of all Snapchat users, change the format back.
I now hate snapchat because of the new update. can’t do anything, always lags, and it’s so crammed in! can never see my friends snap or the people i’m subscribed to. too many ads it’s just terrible.
The update is dumb
I love snapchat a lot it takes a lot of really cute pictures, but I can’t change my username which I’ve had since fifth grade and it is really embarrassing.  It would also be really cool if it said people u might know because I would like to add more people
Snapchat made the clutter a little better, but I don’t want to see people’s stories where my messages are at all. It’s still too cluttered and confusing. I can’t find active chats still because stories pop up. Please fix this. I changed my rating, but I can’t give my 5 stars until the clutter is fixed.
Snapchat was a great app but ever since the update my phone is glitching and so  please fix that
Snapchat reviews went from a 5 star to a 1 in so little. Bring back the old version!! This new one is horrible. Or until someone else invents a new app similar 😂
Snapchat used to be a fun and awesome app but thanks to this new update snapchat is awful
I don’t like everything being clumped together with the new update.
The new update is trash , lost 10 of my streaks because they deleted the app due to the new update sadly I now deleted the app , hopefully they change the layout to the old one sometime soon cause snap chat really is a cool app just the new update really is trash
Reverse the update and you all will be back at the top. This is the worst interface ever. CHANGE IT BACK. NOW.
It feels way too cluttered now I don’t even check my friends snaps anymore. Also the friend list is not alphabetical order now so it takes long to find someone which is why I don’t look at the app anymore.
Okay so Snapchat already has the bad update, but you know what bothers me the most? The font option: It’s not there.  Around the beginning of February the app had updated to have a font option...but not for me. Everyone was getting; my friends said to wait. So I did. A few weeks past...still NOTHING. Finally, an update came around. I excitedly updated the app wanting the font option. Nope. I tried restarting my phone, logging out, and even deleting the app. Still nothing. Why? Idk. Snapchat, if you promise a feature to an update, actually add it; or at least don’t give it to certain users and not all. I used to love Snapchat...no I’m just...disappointed. Wow. How could you do that. Edit: After the newest update...STILL NOTHING. Wow. I’ve also noticed that the videos sometimes don’t record and zoom in. 
1.3 millón lost. thats the beginning for the End!!!
NO SNAPCHAT!!! I CANT SLIDE MY FINGER WITHOUT OPENING A CHAT ANYMORE!! IM SO SAD STOP THE BS YO😓😓
The maps are not working on Snapchat. I don’t know why. A lot of people is telling me there not working. Can you please do a update and make the maps work??
Terrible
Stop making things complicated. The new update is horrible & makes me not want to ever use it lol..
Honestly hate it. Everything is cluttered and nothing is streamlined anymore. Don't like the new send screen as it prioritizes people's names that I don't even snap. I'm sick of Snapchat pushing this "news" which is all glam ad BS. The new story system is clunky and unusable. New Update is not quality.  Ps: new Update actually made the last update preferable. Can you stop making the app worse please? 
I like the whole new update, but it’s peeving me off that I don’t have the different fonts that are supposed to appear for text. I have an iPhone 8+ and all of my updates are current for my phone as well as Snapchat. Please fix this.
How can I rate y’all zero stars?
You botched bro
I used to enjoy snapchat a lot but ever since that stupid update I hardly go on it and when I do use Snapchat you have to watch back the old stories in order to see the new one. This is the most terrible update ever I hope you guys do change it.
Ever since they updated it’s horrible can’t even open stories before it closes on its own 😡 use to love not anymore go back to the way it was next time please ask the users if they like it or not before doing any changes after all we are the ones using the app 🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️😩🙋🏻‍♀️
The look of the new update is very nice, but the old version is better. It was more organized. Now it’s very unorganized. I liked having my friends story’s on one page, Messages on another, and explore on another page also. I dislike how the messages and people story’s are mixed. You can’t alphabetically scroll to who you want to see. I loved Snapchat but after this update I really dislike using it.
Honestly don’t even know how this was approved. The new update is just so confusing and ugly. I cringe every time I open Snapchat now (which believe me is not much anymore)
I’m no longer able to even use the app. It’s not user friendly
The new layout is trash. The user base spoke out and said they didn’t like it, and was ignored.
I’m seriously disappointed in the new update. It’s  frustrating to navigate my friends page, and all the stories make it cluttered. The other side is really hard to navigate too, celebrities and my followed pages aren’t clear anymore, and they’re mixed in with pages and people that I don’t really care about. Please bring back the old Snapchat..
It was good till the updates. Now everything is jumbled. Go back to the original best friends, stories, and not cluttered
I want the cop filter back on
Change snapchat to its original form cuz this one trash
f the new update man
this update is not good for anyone, and you guys should listen to all of the people that are complaining. If there has been this much backlash, you should listen to be a respectable company. Mine updated automatically and I had no choice.
You should change it back to how it used to be it’s way more complicated now.
Usually we can get used to an update because it's simple. This update is absolutely stupid, why would I want to see stories from people I don't follow. I DONT. I'm deleting this app. Thanks Instagram for having a better story option. Bye Snapchat. 👎🏿✌🏿
Hate the update so I will not be using snap chat as much no more IG it is
I used to love snap chat and all its features. But, the recent update is a disgrace to the community. It is messy, stressful, and most certainly unorganized. The new update must go. BRING THE OLND SNAP BACK!
i love it, ion know why others don’t... it’s great:)
The new snapchat update is very bad I’m sorry but it’s true when I watch a start and another person puts something on there story It takes me out the story that o was already watching
Love the redesign; much easier to use. It feels so different from the old way of thinking of social media - Friendster, Myspace, Facebook and now Instagram - they’re all the same. The whole profile page with a history into people’s lives; that thinking feels so dated now and unnatural, and i think its time is almost up. Snapchat is the future. It’s so much richer and feels like a more genuine way to connect with people you actually talk to, vs ‘liking’ (voting, validating) everyone’s photos. Once you stop to think about it, you realize how unnatural and far removed that old social media model is from actual human interaction.
Snapchat really didn't properly think this whole update through.
This is the worst app ever,ever since they updated Snapchat I don’t know how or where to find my friends or add them.
I don't like the new update cuz everything is disorganized 😕 i love Snapchat I have years using the app .
This was once a five star app. And because of the new update it’s a 1... listen to the people and change snap to the way it was before! 😪
I’ll rate this a 5 if you bring back old update ;)
Snapchat used to be user friendly and I could see everybody’s story with one click, now everything is on the left side of the screen and I have to click every individual story. It’s absolutely horrible. Please bring back the old Snapchat.
Nobody can see my stories anymore. It doesn’t even say that I’ve posted anything. Please fix Snapchat and put it back the way it was.
Terrible update, the community hates it and I view stories that I don’t want to by accident now.
How did you guys ruin Snapchat so effortlessly. It’s truly amazing how you guys were able to do it that quick. I don’t use Snapchat anymore it is terrible compared to what it used to be
I did not consent to this garbage update
This new update is terrible. Please change it back to how Snapchat use to be.
THE NEW UPDATE IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST. I never use snapchat anymore, absolutely ruined the app
Please like Remove the update :) & now you can't swipe to chat which is even dumber 
Don’t get me wrong I love Snapchat but this new update is kind of pointless. I mean I got the hang of it but it isn’t a very useful update, it’s like the iPhone X where it has that random notch at the top like what’s the point mod it just make it a full bar. Anyways what I’m trying to say is that nobody thinks this is a good or useful update so could you either go back to the original version or could you just make a better version? Thanks :)
The overall is great and has tons of good features but the new update and the new layout is horrible like so bad the should change it backup the original
I never write reviews, I'm writing this one only because of how bad the new update is. Snapchat knows nobody likes it yet they do nothing about it. This app has gone to from a platform to send pictures to friends to ad after ad about random generated stories that no one cares about.
You guys seriously need to go back to the way things were. I liked it it when the stories were separated. I don’t like seeing everyone’s stories, I seriously don’t. And the stories about everything else is extra. I like Snapchat plain and simple like it was Before- when you only had just snaps and your friends stories. This new update is discouraging and makes me not want to use it. I truly love Snapchat but not the way it is now.
I hate this update so much. I used to like to be able to see my chat when I swiped right, but now it goes to the stories. I want to old snapchat back!!! Obviously a majority of the people who use the app dislike it now. Please change it back snapchat
Love Love Love the app!! However, the day update ruined it all! Unless your not a public figure, the option to play snaps is terrible!! No tabs for just regular peeps using the app??? Are you kidding me! Fix it! It’s awful😩😩😩
I love Snapchat and I know it’s been getting a lot of hate cause of the new update. I hate it too. It’s very unorganized. Everything is squished to one side 🤷🏻‍♀️ now the newest update makes it so when you are added to a story there is a group chat. Change that please. It is very annoying. People have spam stories and they add me and a bunch of people and if you leave the groupchat you leave the story.? Please change snap back to the way it was or at least fix the stories. The stories are very annoying and confusing at first. Also I saw a post on Snapchat going back to its old format? Was it true?? 🙄
Change it back everyone appreciates the old layout your just causing your own downfall of this app
Snapchat clearly does NOT care about our thoughts. How can the majority of its users voice how much they hate the new update and still not do anything about it?? This company sadly is all about the money that it made using the app for difficult and plain boring.
The update ruined Snapchat. Guess I’ll start using FB messenger and invisible messages..
Get rid of the discover feature. I’m not interested in seeing all the crap you want to offer. That’s all.
This went from being the best social media app to the worst!! The updates are very upsetting.
👎👎
This app update is horrible!!!!
You guys are literally killing Snapchat no one is enjoying it anymore, the updates you keep developing are making it worse.
It makes stories and the location from which you’ve posted them available to anyone on Snapchat. There is no privacy setting to fix that. The stories page is gone. No one who values “privacy” or Snapchat stories likes the new update.
This new update is awful I don't even like it using snapchat anymore. This is not snapchat. I use Instagram more now and I use to love snapchat now I open it once at day or less
Since adding the GIFs into stickers my stickers page slow and laggy and never loads
I used to love SnapChat, used it all day everyday, until the update. The new update is confusing and cluttering and ruined what used to be my favorite app. After over 1 million people signed a petition to change it back, they're response was to make a few minor changes, that doesn't account for what anyone wanted or asked for. I'm very displeased with the way Snapchat is handling such negative feedback. I'm deleting my app until the layout is changed back to what the majority of it's users want.
The new update is absolutely terrible and is way too complicated. I’m begging you to please change it back. Thank you.
THIS UPDATE IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. I RECOMMEND YOU CHANGE IT BACK!! I MEAN IT!!!   love,     All Snapchat Users 
I use the app daily and it works fine but the switch in locations of snap stories makes it unnecessarily difficult to use. Please switch it back in the next update!
I was so much happier with the old format. Why did they combine stories with convos? The order is constantly changing, I can’t find certain people anymore. I’m so close to just using Instagram stories and delete Snapchat
I used to like Snapchat and use it o the daily basis but now I don’t because I don’t like the new update.
😤😤😤👎👎👎
This update is disgusting and feels cluttered. I don’t want to have stories on the messages page. I also can’t look at who my friends are without searching them! Having the bitmoji and the story in the chats page looks messy, and I don’t care about the ‘discover’ stuff at all. I don’t want to see stories from people I don’t know.
this junk trash
This is crazy please changed back to the old Snapchat 😩 this new update is really aggravating everyone💯You can’t even send your streaks without Snapchat logging you off of the app🤭 This update is ugly asf😂 so can y’all please change it back to the regular way it was I would appreciate it 💯 Thank you very kindly
Serves no purpose other than to make it less user friendly.
مخيسس
Snapchat is so selfish for keeping this update. Trying to make more money through discover and even saying this update was only for the sellers of Snapchat ITS SO DUMB. You’re not thinking about your users and what they want, and that’s what makes good business, not promoting yourself regardless of the public opinion. I hate Snapchat now.
i bet you’re sick of reading this but the new update is terrible. the only good thing is that people’s bitmojis are next to their names and the gif finder. EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THE LAYOUT IS TERRIBLE. please put the stories back where they were, and please switch back to the normal way of sending things. the only reason i’m still using it is because of the streaks.
This new update is trash
What's the point?
Used to spend hours a day on this app, now only about 20 min to do my streaks each day, that’s the only thing that keeps me on the app, it’s some trash now.
The new update to fix what you messed up in the previous update isn't any better it's still just as useless. I have to say I loved snapchat but now it's not as user friendly and frankly a bad experience. This is it I'm at the point of deleting this app. You can see that users do not like it due to your incredibly low rate (1.8) so why don't you just fix it the whole point of snapchat is to take pictures to share with people but it's so hard to use the app people don't share, people don't view stories as much because you can't find them the new update fixed that but I don't want to be swiping left for stores make the tabs in the order the old snapchat was in and get rid of bitmojis before names because it's creepy if they don't have a bitmoji.
Can we just go back to the old set up please? This update is horrible. I liked the way it was before sooooo much better.
Do not like the new update and how Snapchat is switched around. It doesn’t make sense when your trying to talk to your friend and then it disappears because someone uploaded a recent story . It’s annoying ! Liked the old version
I hate the new version change it back to the old version.
I STILL DONT UNDERSTAND WHY THEY KEEP MAKING UPDATES BUT ITS STILL THIS NASTY LOOKING FORMAT!!! WE WANT OUR STORIES SERRATE FROM OUR RECENTS AND WE WANT THEM TO BE IN SOME TYPE OF ORDER!!! IF YOU THINK WE FORGOT ABOUT IT WE HAVE NOT! CHANGE IT BACK TO THE NICER, NEATER, BETTER FORMAT!!!!! ASAP
We should rename this app Crapchat! Idk when they are planning to fix this app, but I hope it’s soon.
So you know how the iPhone has a deleted file where whenever you delete a picture or accidentally delete a picture you can go back and recover the picture/video. Well you should add a deleted file where if you accidentally deleted a video/picture, you can go back and recover the picture/video. I’m only saying this because I get the “edit picture “ and the “delete picture” button confused because the buttons are right  next to each other and it has cause me to accidentally delete pictures/videos and I wasn’t able to get the pictures/videos back. Please consider on adding this, thanks :): 
the new update suckssss
Since that last stupid update I CANT SEE MY FRIENDS STORIES. FIX IT
I want the old Snap 💔
Can you change it to the first Snapchat because I just don't like it and i hate that it shows me the stories of the person when i talk to them so please change it to the first snapchat PLEASEEE
Trash
Are you not reading any of these reviews or is it not important because by mixing up the stories you receive more in add revenue because you are forced to watched pushed pages when cycling through. Delete the app people and they will change it back when they lose money. Until then all they care about is profits not customer satisfaction. This is why there is no Help Chat or Phone number for Snapchat. They are a tech joke. 1.8 solid rating.
The last update is absolutely awful. Interface is confusing as hell. Everything is jumbled together and direct messaging is atrocious now. I wasn’t even a big fan of how it has been in the past, but I really don’t like what you guys have changed. It is not easy to use and navigate.
I had to re-teach me gma but oh well I like the app
app is garbage now. yall messed up big time.
I cannot stand this update. I have almost deleted the entire app because of this. I hate how everything is all together now, it makes it feel like there’s less to do. Also, if I don’t Snapchat someone normally (and even if I do), it’s hard to ever catch their story. One of the most annoying things is how when you Snapchat someone, their name/chat goes all the way to the bottom of all your other chats you haven’t opened yet. I understand this is because it is now ordered from most recently posted on their story or most recently sent you something but it’s so stupid! I hate that order it makes it so complicated and takes extra time. This next complaint has been around for a while but I wish there was a way to erase like the little pen , X (if you want to delete the snap) , and like emoji button etc because sometimes I want to see what’s behind that. Additionally, now the discover page will replay stories I have already seen.  I miss the old Snapchat. Please bring it back I’m begging you because overall I think the idea of Snapchat is genius. Everything disappears so you can say whatever without worrying about it always being there to haunt you. I love streaks, they make you get on Snapchat everyday which is smart and addictive. I don’t want to have to delete it but I will if nothing changes.
Used to use this all the time, now it’s on to Instagram!
Garbage update
What happened?? Used to have cool stories and articles to read now all I see is bull crap about celebrities and the kardasheons or whatever the ef they’re called. All the filters are the exact same stupid puppy bunny cat ears and noses. Add some new stuff!!!!!!! Deleting this app soon if no changes are made. Sad it’s gone down hill this much.
Bring the old snap back
The new UI is literally so ugly and poorly designed that I barely even use Snapchat anymore. SAD.
if this new update isn’t reverted soon i will be deleting and only texting people. it’s actual trash. NOBODY likes it okay? take our advice.
You guys tried to fix the original and it didn’t work. No one likes the format and in the plate recently the format barely changed. Just adding a little “stories” tab doesn’t fix it. Listen to your uses and BRING IT BACK TO NORMAL! Don’t try and rearrange the format and think you’re making it better.
The new Snapchat is so confusing and overwhelming. I’m a big fan of updating and changing, but I think this one really hit the mark and it seems everyone else agrees. I hate having to scroll through tons of friends I don’t normally talk to to find the stories or chats of friends I talk to daily aka my “best friends” whom use to stay at the top of my easy to guide messages. I also hate having to go through tons of stories to find the one I was searching for. Now the popular stories from celebrities or groups I use to watch a lot are on the other side along with ads and stories I don’t care to add, so their stories go I watched usually. I think this is leading to a lot of people getting off the app and sending to other social media’s so now I’m missing out on a lot! The only part of the update I enjoy is the new text styles and multiple texts you can add to your snaps, which is what the app is all about. We don’t need fancy updates, we just want to be able to snap and hear from who we want to.
Snapchat sold out to advertisers.
Despite the recent update to add a tab to access stories which is a start the app is still TOO busy and complicated. You have to click one TINY icon to watch stories despite it being its own tab, click the name and it opens chat. The swipe option to chat was way better on the old version. Sadly if this app doesn’t improve I will be deleting it, several people I share with on the app already use it much less after these updates because it is so complicated. Such a good app but now it is just annoying to navigate.
It’s been a while since the update with the new layout was sent out. I understand that the company was hoping people will get use to the layout soon enough but from personal experience as well as what I’ve heard from many friends we still think this update is horrible. I’m not reaching a larger audience anymore because my story is not necessarily always shown at the top for all of the people who have added me as friends. I also have a hard time looking for my friends or their stories.  I have already stopped used the Snapchat app as much because I do not understand or like it very much. I don’t know if it’s possible but many of Snapchat users would appreciate if you could bring the old layout back. The new one is way too confusing and complicated.
It’s garbage . Change it back to the original format please !!!!
I think we can all agree the new update is terrible and many have said it. Snapchat, why don’t you just listen to your users and change snapchat back to before the update or fix something quick. What is the point of this stupid update anyways, you guys are losing so many users. I seriously hate this app now and it’s a shame because I used to love snapchat.
i recently just got the new update and i’m already used to it. i don’t really have a problem w it anymore, but everytime i need to use the camera it goes all black and it’s really annoying bc i like taking pics. so maybe could you do a new update that fixes glitches? also i really like the new giphy option!
Please please go back to old version. This update was a terrible idea.
I’m sorry but I’m a huge fan of Sanp 👻, but this update is not engaging anymore, it’s so complicated now that it makes you almost not want to use it.
It was awesome app before u came up with last update . Don’t like how we have recent chat list it was suppose to be secret when other ppl go through ur phone they wouldn’t know. n all the chats I deleted r still coming back. It was simple n easy slide to the right u get all the messages u sent now after deleting them they still there
No one wants another Snapchat update when the last one was so bad. We just want the old Snapchat back. And unless this update with reverse the last update, not interested.
good
New update totally ruined it, would give 0 stars if I could
Snapchat is a awesome app I love it and honestly I would rate it 5 stars but thanks to the new update I’m not. I hate the new update Snapchat please fix it and go back to how it used to be.
The features are good but the customer service is subpar.
The new update just made snapchat confusing. And also has lots of bugs. When i try to send someone a message it turns out i sent it to the wrong person. When i CLEARLY PRESSED ON THE NAME.
I hate this update.  I’ve tried to get used to it but I can’t do it.  I can’t find any of the people whose stories I want to see.  It seems like you put what you want us to see.  It is really terrible.  You should have left it as it was.
New update stinks. Don’t download this app until they go back to the old Snapchat
Snapchat crashes whenever I try to save video snaps. Please fix this.
Change it back please .
Please go back to the old layout
Fix story’s ASAP or no one will use this app lol
The new update is bad make a new one but It is very convenient thanks
I much rather have the old Format then the one they updated it to. It’s hard to understand and hard to actually use, when you reply that person goes down to the bottom and you always end up leaving them on seen and confusing someone else
It’s terrible NOW if I could give it 0 stars I would sorry lol
The update is too cluttered and doesn’t reflect on snapchats originally simple nature. It’s ruining the formula it originally had and it makes everything harder to navigate.
So I love snapchat and I’ve been using it for a while. I liked how easy it was to view stories and snap people. But the latest update makes it almost impossible to watch stories from everyone, and I can’t see private or group stories at all. I really liked the way it was before, with chronological stories, so please bring the old snap back
The change it back to the the old lay out it was literally perfect
You should make some adjustments and simplify the new face of your app. I have two phones and I never use the new updated one for snapchat !
Hate Snapchat. Take me back to snap chat in 2013 🤦🏻‍♀️😩
y’all really made it even worse than it already was i’m out
The new update is so awful!!!! Fix this big mistake
Bad
New update is the trashiest update ever created
New update ruined the app
We want the old version back !!!!  I hate using it now bcuz it became so complicated, boring, and hard to use.
Please change it back to how it was. I’m ready to delete this app because it glitches out and the new update is trash. Everyone in my school hates the new update
Every update is even worse than the last. Take this L
Okay so on all of my friends phones, they have Snapchat and they hav the new update thing where you can make the text into like neon or a rainbow. They’ve had that for about a few weeks now and I still only have that yet. I got the update yesterday, but I still don’t even have the cool text features yet.. please help me out!!
I hate the new version. They should of kept the app the way it was. The old version was way more organized with the stories and friend list separate. Just looked cluttered. Smh They need to change it back!!!!!
i hate this update. i lost all my streaks.
Now I’m never on Snapchat, this update is just really bad plz fix it back :(
I never write reviews for apps so this is my first but why did u have to ruin Snapchat it’s was completely fine as it was before, ik this is making you guys more money but think about us also 😭
as i’m sure you know, nobody is pleased with the update. but for me, i have many streaks and send them out at least once every single day for sure. it keeps saying i’m losing streaks and have timers even though the other person and myself have definitely sent a picture. the streak will be gone for a while and return within a few days, but i know this isn’t just happening to me and it’s a very annoying issue.
The new update is the worst. I don't use or look at Snapchat anymore and I used to use it daily. Uninstalling it.
I lu e Thai app truly I use it everyday to post, talk to my friends, and use the silly filters. But the update has made the app a little harder. You can't find you tubers  stories unless you text them which is kinda stupid or you have to look through the whole discovery. Again silly. Please bring back old Snapchat. #oldsnapchat
I’ve been having Snapchat for years now and I’ve always loved every new update but ever since Snapchat has updated to .25 version everyone including myself been really upset. It’s trash now. It’s so hard to find my friends story and it’s just so bad !!! WE WANT SC BACK
Update is horrible. I don't even want to use snapchat anymore.
I have to go back and try and find stories and it’s extra af and I hate this app now probably going to delete it
Okay anytime I make a video on Snapchat. I get a notification during the video it delete the video while I am recording. Please fix this bug like ASAP.
I’m right handed, and with this update, when I take a snap and type out some text and say I want to slide the black text bar up a little, I typically slide with my right thumb. But now, the trash icon will pop up on the right side of the screen when you want to slide that text around so now 3/4ths of the time when I want to slide that text bar up my thumb slides over that trash icon and I accidentally delete my entire text. This whole update is completely not user friendly and it keeps getting worse. Just my opinion, Snapchat is so hard to use now.
App gets worse and worse. So disappointed
I think the update is stupid and I hate it
Just delete the app already... this person been harassing me the name is finesse_prince4 how could I make this person not have snap anymore.Thanks if you could do that I would appreciate it.
Not sure why you still haven’t listened to EVERYONE about going back to the old one .
I personally loved the old Snapchat, please change it back.
تحديث فاشل
Can you add back the most recent chats to the top. It’s annoying to have to manually look for my people
Snapchat was my favorite social media platform for over 5 years and I had been a very avid user that whole time but it really saddens me that this new update has actually ruined the whole experience of being on the app. I can’t see where the stories are clearly, it’s horribly cluttered with wayyy too much for the user to ever ENJOY their usage now. It seems largely focused on just shoving dumb, paid-for articles and “popular stories” down our throats by the fact that their is one entire screen side for that. Before it was smart because everyone knew the articles were stupid but because they were so close to your friends stories and at your eye level, almost everyone still clicked on some. Now I just don’t even bother. I used to absolutely love posting stories and it was honestly a main form communication for me and many others—now I’m it just feels like a pure waste of effort because everyone else also hates the new look/update as well and in the end it all just means goodbye to snap )): it had such a good run...
I thought when I updated my snapchat, it would go back to normal. Instead, y’all just added to the complexity. Was it supposed to be better just cause you added a section for stories? Everything still out of order! I like to be able to slide and preview my chats before opening them but now I can’t because when I try it just slides over to stories! These updates get worse and worse I don’t understand why we can’t go back to the way it was before. I’m really suggesting that I stop using the app. This is getting nothing but more aggravating.
Used it from the beginning, now the discover area is infested with advertisements and the app is cluttered so bad. You guys ruined this app and you’re not even considering how the community feels about it. 4-5 stars down to 1.8? Should be a pretty decent example of your screwup.
The only reason it is a 1 star is the new layout is making people uninstall Snapchat please change it back because you’re app will crash and burn and everyone will hate SnapChat if you don’t change it now you will lose you’re popularity will decrease and no one will ever use SnapChat
Is horrible I want the old snap back
Snapchat was always pretty rough UX wise. This new update ruined it. Just broke all my streaks and uninstalled. 
you guys are idiots for making this update, I hope you guys lose stock market
Please revert this update. That is all.
This update is fowl... y’all need to stop
I want to update, did not get me
In Snapchats beginning it was a simple and fun way to connect with your friends. Over the years they have become a huge platform to brainwash and instill communist / socialist beliefs into the youth of this country. They prey on young people’s gullibility. Take my advice and delete this application. It is filled with nothing but propaganda and irrelevant stories. It is no longer a social media application. It is a nasty bias political platform. If you like the functionality of the app just do yourself a favor and download Instagram. They have this horrible application beat and the app doesn't try to shove left side political propaganda down your throat every second of every day. You also will not have to worry about knowing what the worthless Kardashian family ate for breakfast every morning. Also Snapchat thinks they have the right to force you to save your posts to THEIR servers before you can save it to your camera roll. Invasion of privacy to say the least.
I hate the new update 👎🏽 wish you guess would just change It back to normal....If y’all going to make any new updates make It were Snapchat can go live !
new update, the face filters do not work. sad. disappointed. bummed. back to IG only! :D
I gave this app 1 star because, the new update is trash and we want the old one back and don’t ever do this again we all hate it and you will start only getting rated 1 star and everyone will use Instagram and no one will use Snapchat anymore and all the money y’all make off of this app is all gone !! CHANGE IT BACKK NOWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The tab feature was a good addition, but these changes can make the app nicer to use.  1) Make an option for stories to be sorted by “Recent” (time the story was last updated) or “Alphabetical” (by the name of the friend who posted it). Maybe default to recent when the app is closed and opened to prioritize new stories.   2) Bring back the button where you can play all stories at once, or select a group of users’ stories to watch. 
this update is the worst
😡🤬
fix this bug because it is so annoying when i get a notification and it pauses my music
order customized filter and paid, but did not worked after paid approval
Good bye trashchat moving on to ig stories. You actually played yourself
AIDSAIDSAIDS
Awful awful awful. HORRIBLE update, notice how your ratings went down from almost 5 stars to 2 stars???? TAKE THE HINT
these updates are trash , take it back to the old version
Update is full of bad ideas.
This sh*t trash now
please bring back the old snapchat. this new one is really not fun to use and I rarely go on it anymore. The times i do go on it, I get so frustrated because it is so hard to use and I recommend you bring back the old one.
Perfect example of updating for updating‘s sake. Hard to find things now, a lot more annoying to view stories the developers get ad revenue off which makes no sense. Great app just heading in the wrong direction .
Okay so I literally get on Snapchat everyday it’s my go to app and I didn’t mind the new update but this NEW UPDATE is actual trash I can’t stand it for one it didn’t say that you would now have to tap to chat w someone and it literally takes 8 years to pull up and I’m not very fond of it AT ALL FIX IT !
You don’t understand how much this makes me want to die, why haven’t you fixed this yet ?
this app was the best thing until they did everyone dirty and made the most ugly and complicated update ever that even kylie jenner stopped using it. CHANGE SNAPCHAT BACK. NO ONE WILL JUDGE YOU. THERE IS LITERALLY NO PURPOSE THAT YOU HAD TO MAKE THE APP SO HORRIBLE. I USED GO GET 100+ VIEWS NOW I GET 40 ON A GOOD DAY BECAUSE EVERYONE GAVE UP ON THIS APP. anyway correct your mistake.
Every time I open snapchat I want to throw my phone across the room. Thanks update.
This new update is the worst thing you could have done to this app. The old Snapchat was way easier and more efficient in finding things that I wanted to see, now it’s all cluttered and inconvenient. As far as I can tell by the other reviews NOBODY like it. Your ratings are crashing and use of this will soon plummet as well please just bring back the old layout
Everytime I take a photo it takes a while to show the outer face and when it does it crashes I go back on the app take another photo and the same thing all it does is crash please fix this
RIP SNAPCHAT!
Look, I wrote a review complaining about the update and so have many people before, so why haven’t you undone it already?? I love Snapchat and don’t think will ever stop using it, but this update is frustrating so for the love of God (or whatever you believe in and if you don’t believe in anything, than for the love of humanity) change it alreadyyyy!! 😭
...
this is the worst thing ever. i have deleted snapchat because of how much i hate this update. please return to old style
You’ve made it easier to just use our all-in-one/minimal ad having Instagram 😊
okay so i could live with the update before but now on the chat page you can like slide for stories and groups and not only does that make the storied page kind of irrelevant but it makes it harder for me bc im used to sliding over to open conversations and i do not like it at all
IT STRESSES ME OUT THAT NOT EVERYTHING IS CHRONOLOGICAL OR ORGANIZED!IVE BEEN USING SNAPCHAT SINCE 2012 but I WILL NOT USE IT AGAIN UNTIL I HEAR ITS CHANGED BACK
I love the app. I like to post to my story for my friends to see and watch the stories they post. But I really dislike the new update.
I love Snapchat but the new update is awful. Everything is on one side and it’s to much clutter and it’s annoying,but other than that I love it I use it all the time to interact with friends.
This app is so amazing i recommended for people u should get it and I really love the filters
CHANGE THE UPDATE
I’m sorry Snapchat, as you’ve heard a million times, this update is so bad. Stories and private chats should not be in the same menu. I constantly accidentally start chatting with someone when trying to view their story. There’s no order to it, my friends are always jumping around. Also the public stories window is awful. I only want to see things I follow, NOT what you suggest. And it’s disorganized, Pinterest feel.   Honorary star for the new fonts though. 
More things to fix. Everytime I try to swipe left to open any conversation like I used to, instead it goes the “stories or groups” windows integrated with the last update. Please fix this and stop ignoring people
Usually I would of given this app a 5 star but I’m completely annoyed w the new update. The way it used to be was SOOOOO MUCH BETTER.  BRING BACK THE OLD SNAPCHAT 
Hi Snapchat Team,     I know you announce for this new snapchat look and maybe there’s no way to bring the old look to us but im sure we have the Right to follow the people we like and hide the other if we not interested to see them ( example ) im a Football Fan what i do with this makeup artist  Or Music people all what we request to give us a choice to have what we like because thats what we deserve   Thanks . 
👎👎👎
So snapchat WAS this cool app, now it’s all just a waste of cellphone memory.
I loved yo use snapchat and i use that everyday but the new update made me stop useing the app the new update is complete bad i hate it my chats and story got togather and onces u saw story of someone then your not able to know who posted in case you forget or want to see again so u have to click on each ones account to see if they were posted. Make the snapchat like before.
Update is so bad change it back to the old snap plz
The newest update has made Snapchat extremely unorganized and messy! Please change this!
Plain and simple, the new snapchat design style killed the app personally for myself. Watching friends stories is very confusing, tedious, and the overall design looks cluttered. The new explore panel is awful, and the content seems to cater to snapchat themselves by advertising low quality "news" articles and contains stories of celebrities who I don't care about. Snapchat is dead unless they go back to the old format.
don’t get app
Just go back to normal. Stop making it worse with each update
Please stop pulling a Microsoft. Personally I like the new design, but do you know what would be nice? IF YOU GAVE PEOPLE THE OPTION TO CHOOSE WHICH LAYOUT THEY WANT! It's not that hard of a concept, you keep the setting you want users to use as the default, and you implement a setting to revert to the old style. Why is it so hard for developers to understand that people want options? I'm all for rolling out new designs, and I personally LOVE the new design, but I HATE how you forced it on your users without a second thought or another option. So many people hate this version, you would've upset LITERALLY NO ONE if you gave your users a choice.
Please.  This new update is awful. 
The new update is terrible. Just a push for their discover page. Just so those companies can get more traffic and Snapchat can rack in more $$$. Selling out their users to priorities the companies that advertise on the app. Hoping for a change but i know that is not happening. Wouldn’t recommend it.
Sc is a mess and I don’t even want to open or use the app anymore.
Please go back to the old version. This new update is so bad and no one likes it
Hey Snapchat u need to fix ur app ! Every time i go on and like take a picture or saving something * boom * snapchat crashes * like at first i was like wth then i see it keeps happening like this is not okay . 🤦🏽‍♂️
NOBODY SHOULD OPEN SNAPCHAT ANYMORE THIS UPDATE IS THE WORST 🖕🏻
Still waiting for y’all to fix this crap, gonna delete soon if not.
change it back no one like it’s you’re losing money!
So I LOVE Snapchat! And I love the new font options on the newest update but I wouldn't update unless you have too because. The new story upgrade is HORRIBLE! And so confusing! And really hope SC makes it the way it was again SOON!!
this update is trash and confusing  everyone hates it 
I don’t like the update plan and simple I liked the old Snapchat better and I made a new account to see if it would be the same old Snapchat we all loved and well I had to update cause the old one was “outdated” I’m just really displeased with the update but I guess I’ll have to get used to it
The newest update is horrible !!! All of this is horrible !!
I don't recommend to update this version! Really bad! I can not see the message before I read it!
I hated the update but the “stories” section made it more tolerable, it would be even better and more organized if the stories were back in order from who most recently posted though
4 words. This update is trash. Nobody likes this update. It S U C K S. Change it back to how it was before. Yeah I’m going to continue to use it because that’s how I contact most of my friends, but seriously nobody likes this update. Have you seen your ratings for this app? 1.8 stars? Woah.
Snapchat was fine until this last update. Cannot stand the new format. Will most likely delete and just stick to Instagram.
Can’t stand the new update.. I no longer use the app and have now uninstalled it from my phone
Snapchat used to be the only reliable thing in my life and now it’s all messed up and I can’t handle it
It’s awful since the update
I usually like to see other people’s stories especially the famous people. Now I have to go to the discover to see their snaps. My main concern is that it’s all disorganized. I love the rest but I need more organization like the old update PLEASE.
The new update 👎🏼
Needs to bring back the old easier snap chat
In my opinion I like the new update.👍
sooo snapchat is a great app and i love it so much. but the new update is so confusing and hard to find stories and the names go away so you always have to search for them and i don’t like it. i just what the old update back. please set it back to the old ways 😭😭
Let me know when you bring the old Snapchat back.
New update makes everything look cluttered. It’s hard to read the text. Personally I liked that you had two different pages for your friends stories and then another page to chat with other people. On the other hand the Bitmoji was probably the only good thing I liked about it.
Whoever thought this update was a good idea needs fired. CHANGE IT BACK.
Change the new update! It’s so bad
At this point I’d rather send pictures over iMessage
this new update is trash . i Don’t understand why you guys keep updating it. y’all just finna lose a of money cause ain’t nobody finna be using snap . this app is real trash y’all den messed up 😑.
Ever since they updated Snapchat it’s terrible don’t use this app until they fix it everything is confusing and unorganized I can’t even find a friends snapchat without having to type it in right after sending that friend a message don’t use this app #changeitback
rip to the good ol’ snapchat. honestly the worst thing snapchat could have done 🤷🏻‍♀️
The new update is terrible the old one was great u hope they reverse to the old version
Hate the update. Will be using Instagram story’s instead of Snapchat from here on out
Update Garbagio
Update is wack, confusing to find my friends
Yup, definitely won’t be using this app anymore.
i was ALWAYS on snapchat but the new update is TERRIBLE I HATE IT!!!! PLEASE CHANGE IT
Trash
If there was an option to put Zero stars I would. This app is destroying itself. no need to try and fix your mistakes by adding new more complicated stuff. Change it back to how the old snapchat was where stories and snaps are completely separated and there is no ads page. This is becoming annoying. I cant wait for another company to create what this app once had. Give the people what they want, stop trying to ruin your app because of money.
Loved snap until this new update. I called customer service and they said they were going to revert it back in 2-3 days and that was 2 weeks ago. Honestly, screw you snap chat for not listening to your users. No one likes this update!
I love snapchat but the new update is horrible. I just hope they change it back
I actually love the update but can you have one big change. I don’t like the quality of the front camera on iPhone X. It comes out blurry can you please optimize for a higher quality.
I'm not gonna lie the update looks pretty cool but when I open my friends story it only lets me see the first one then stops other then that it looks really nice, great job Snapchat I just have to get a little use to it tho
Rip to my youth you have let me down, I have no other option but to discontinue this app
I used to use this app to text most of my friends. It’s becoming very confusing. The first update most of the people in my classes hated it including me , this update is just making it worse. Just put the stories back on the original page and have the group chats and normal chats on the same page. I can’t believe that Snapchat is still updating.. :/
EVERYONE ON THE PLANET HATES THE UPDATE, I HAVE A HALF MILLION SNAP SCORE, THIS APP USED TO MY LIFE MAKE THE APP USEFUL AGAIN AND GO BACK TO BEFORE THIS UPDATE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE I CANT STAND IT ANYMORE, OR GIVE US AN OPTION FOR THIS VERSION OR THE PREVIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I loved snapchat and use it everyday for everything , it was one of my favorite apps and most effective and enjoyable to reach a large audience fast. BUT due to their recent update it has made it so complicated, hard to use , and nearly impossible to hold conversation and talk to all your friends like you used to be able to . I feel as if snapchat is over until they change this update or revert back to older versions . I will now be moving to other social media’s for ease of use and network ability, Snapchat is HORRIBLE now & everyone I know agrees, I only gave it a one star because 0 stars isn’t possible... VERY DISAPPOINTED SNAPCHAT! 
Please bring back the old update this is devastating. The stories should stay on the right side and the conversations should stay to the left without seeing their bitmojj it just makes sense.
It's just a mess. I open the app less and less every day.
the new update is SO HORRENDOUS. no do not tell me it is something to get used to. there’s a difference btwn needing to get used to an update and knowing when the update is terrible. this update is TERRIBLE.   edit: it’s been like a month now and nope not “used” to the update like snapchat claimed we all would be. it’s still horrendously awful. i barely watch my friend’s stories now and they barely watch mine. what’s the point of even using snapchat anymore. it’s terrible.  edit: sc has been updated and i still hate the update, but it improved. if snapchat moves all the private stories and stories of the people we subscribed to to the “stories” section on the left side, i’d forgive snapchat for this horrible mistake they’ve made with their app 
i’ve never been more disappointed i lost more than 100 views i’m legitimately upset
It’s great , we’ll it used to be , considering everybody wants it to go back besides you MEANS you should change it back , I mean look at your ratings... more than 70% is 1 star. But hey if that’s what you want , that’s you.
Snapchat change for their benefits I don’t want to watch Random people I don’t know and my friend are separated and it’s hard to find the list terrible update
I used to love using Snapchat. I use it more than my regular iMessage to stay in touch with my friends. But the new format that came with the update is terrible. I like the old format where you had the chat section and then the other section to view anyone’s story. Now it’s all together an erasing conversations doesn’t even move the person off the page because they post a story. It’s just to cluttered. Bring back the old format
The update made me delete it  🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 
This update is really confusing you should make a setting on where you can have the up or the old version if you want
So, I got the notification to update Snapchat so I was like why not, I know people were saying it was bad but I wanted to try it out for myself. So first off, I would like the say the way the stories are set up is great! You don’t need to press and play on people’s Snapchats, all you need to do is press on a Snapchat story and you can go through all your friends stories. But here’s the issue that I have right now. When opening up Snapchat’s of your friends, it would normally just be that person and you send them that Snapchat. For some reason, I opened someone’s Snapchat, it opened the next one after. At the same time, I pressed a person to send a snap, I even checked who I was sending it to and apparently, it sent it to another person! I’m really annoyed with app and I’m not even 2 days in to using the new update. I would like either the old Snapchat back or like these issues to be fixed. I’m really close to not even using this app anymore right now
Snap chat was fine before the update
Before the update you used to have easier access to your friends stories as well as other peoples stories. Now with the new update it takes a lot more effort just to see what your friends are up to. At this point it is only a messeging app because views on stories have dropped more than half!
I cannot use snap anymore it looks so gay so pls bring the old update back. BTW AMOS: g.llauraa (no creeps plz)
Snapchat overall is my go to for talking to friends and keeping in contact. The new update really throws me off, I don't like the stories tab aspect. I like how it used to be. I nearly never look at them anymore unless it's on the Chat tab. Then I'll look at a few and be on my way. I love the Bitmoji update although, mine actually looks like me now. The stories, not so much. Put the story watch like it used to be and I'll be satisfied to use it again!
If it isn't broken, don't fix it ya nerd.
The new Snapchat update 10.26.1.0. is probably one of the worst changes in snapchat history. Nobody has been wanting to use Snapchat lately because of the whole stories on the same side as the snaps and that really irritates people because you can’t tell whether someone snapped you or if it’s just a story. I think the bitmojis by the name will be ok in the long run with getting used to and I think that if you change the stories to being separate from the snaps it would truly make a big impact and I think everyone would enjoy the app so much more. Thank you
You’ve introduced a ton of new features that aren’t that great. I’m still waiting on a freaking chat log. No wonder your app is just for 🍆
The app was one of my favorite apps but ever since they updated it, it has just gotten worse and worse might as well use email now. They try to add little updates and make it a little better but for me it’s just not working, I’m sorry. I like the Bitmoji style, but I really don’t like the actual stapchat it’s self. I top part were you can swipe over to see story’s and groups and stuff is really bad. I liked how you could swipe half way over on a chat so if you didn’t wanna talk to someone you could just see what they said and decide to not answer them. If some people like it then I think snapchat should have it to were in settings you can switch to the old snapchat and how you can switch to the old snapchat. If you could please change it back or something that would be greatly appreciated. Until then add me;)-elliseroses18
When you are drawing on photos every thing like the send button and back arrow should go away. They make it to where you can’t color in some places.
The whole layout after the most recent update that automatically downloaded causes the app to crash constantly and the layout is horrendous. I deleted the app when I had an Android because I couldn’t stand the camera quality. Now I have camera but the app constantly disappoints or lets me down rendering it worthless. A much older version of snapchat ran better on my Note 4 than my iPhone X. Looks like it’s time to take it off again! 👍🏼
The redesign makes no sense, but what’s worse than anything is the fact that everything is out of order, the whole point of snapchat is to be in the moment with what ur friends r doing right then. So taking away the chronological feed just doesn’t work.
Still strange, but it just takes some time getting used to.
This app is trash now
Give us the ability to go back to the old version of the app.  Stop forcing people to watch these ridiculous stories. If you’re in the game of making money listen to your users instead of forcing this on them... I get it, you guys really want to make as much money off of adds as possible, but you’re not youtube or instagram, you’re Snapchat, where it’s supposed to be as simple as sending a pic that disappears in a few seconds. You guys really butchered this app, good job 👌🏻
My friend’s Snapchat has been hacked plsss we need It back  Snapchat help us pls 😭 Her username is @altionab  Pls help us snapchat 
There is absolutely no logical organization of the friends page. The app used to make it easy to watch stories by clicking on the first one and it would take you though the next stories one by one. Now you have to click on each name individually and scroll all over the place to find stories.
Your reviews have clearly spoken and it's should be obvious that people don't like this update. Bring us back to the older version.
IM REALLY NOT ENJOYING SNAP ANYMORE, CAN WE PLS CHANGE IT BACK
I loved Snapchat but the update made me hate Snapchat all together
What makes the app lame is that the messages and stories are on the same page, why must it be so cluttered, messages are hard to find and when you don’t Message a certain person often it looks like it just disappears. That’s really annoying that you literally have to go search for the person you want to talk to you and then message them instead of it just being there in your messages. The Discover page isn’t a big deal to me, it’s annoying that it plays automatically, but it’s not the worst thing. Please revise the message and stories. Because that’s dead.
The new update is just complicated. The old one was simple and easy to use.
And the update keeps getting worse and worse just make it back to the old Snapchat that we love and miss !!! Only got 1.5 stars out of 5 just change it back
Put stories in chronological order
The new update it’s horrible, you couldn’t have done anything worse than that.
I want to change my Snapchat I hate the new upgrade it’s so stupid you could’ve left it how it was
Will not download Snapchat again until the only snap comes back
The old old Snapchat was amazing and I used it and liked it but then the update came and it made me not like using it anymore and I stopped using it. Now you just got a new update trying to fix hay and it’s even worse. You guys messed up your app. Everyone agrees that it’s awful now and no one likes it
Please BRING BACK THE OLD SNAPCHAT. The update was absolutely horrible & I’m not impressed at all. I’ve been using Snapchat for a very long time (4+years). I’m very upset & giving up Snapchat because I just can’t find anything to like about this new update. Unless the old version of Snapchat returns, I’ll start using the app again. Very disappointed.
Its very hard to Find your own story, why is it so hidden? Also why do I have random celebrities stories pop-up on my Snapchat?! I never followed Snooki in my life, actually I find it offensive that you would chose somebody for me to follow. Please fix these issues!
The new update make everything look messy. Now i have to search for my main snap chat buddy's when before they were just at the top of my messages. Why change that?
Crazy
The new update so bad.
All that anyone wanted was to put stories back in chronological order. And to be completely separate from the received and sent snaps. And you missed the mark yet again with the update today. I don’t want my received and sent snap order out of order because of other people’s stories... that’s what the story tab is for. Don’t mix them. And put stories back in chronological order. There is absolutely no practical reason why they shouldn’t be in chronological order. Unless you’re trying to piss everyone off.
I purposely did not update my Snapchat because I HATED the look of it. I turned off automatic updates and everything. Then, one day, I clicked on Snapchat and it had updated itself. I am FURIOUS. I haven’t used this app since. It’s stupid and so messy. This has been a terrible update and I think it shows - given the terrible rating and drop in stock. Snapchat, you should really fix this problem or else Instagram will take over.
The updates get worse and worse
Patiently waiting for you to get rid of this update and go back to how it used to be
New design is so awful
Its just plain dumb
If you get the app you won't regret it I promise you that!!!
Dear Snapchat, I am one of the very few people that do not hate your update. However, I HATE that you have to avoid sliding your text over the trash can. My app updated yesterday and I’ve ended up deleting my whole text about 20 times already. This is pointless. If a user wants to delete their text, they can use the delete key on their keyboard.   This is just going overboard. 
I just love it 💝😊
I just wanted to take time to say that I still have not gotten used to the new Snapchat and probably never will. I still want the old one back because I have sent some embarrassing things to the wrong people and so have my friends. It refreshes when I am not ready for it to refresh and I have found myself missing the stories of snappers that I actually want to watch. Even if you guys do not bring the old Snapchat back, at least separate the stories from the actually chat side. Life will be so much better with just a little separation. I dread getting onto Snapchat these days, but I have streaks that are well over 400 days and I refuse to break them. Please help us out soon because I miss seeing things that are going on with my friends the way that I used to. -A Lifetime Snapchat User 
The new update is awful and confusing the old Snapchat was good. When something is going good y change it?  Maybe if you changed it back to how it was Kylie would use it but doesn't seem like you guys care about the consumer. 
What a crappy update! What a crappy layout. I don’t want to watch the worlds drama and life of the world. Only my friends & specific snaps. I HATE the layout and how I have to tap on the little circle just to view a story. Or to write a message, I need to tap on the NAME?! Ughhh. Go back to the old layout where the main page is of my friends and family, not the stinking celebrity lives. Sheesh!!
This update has made everything cluttered and packed into one screen. It’s definitely not one of those updates people will just get use to over time.
Was one of the best apps, and an app i personally used everyday before the update. Stories and snaps should not be correlated together, all it does it make you forget who you were talking too, and make you see people’s stories that you don't care about. All snap needs is to separate the stories and snaps.
Dear snap team,   Thank you for this app. It’s not like Instagram in many ways and that’s why it’s amazing.   Let’s get real though. After using Snapchat for years...the newest update is not clean and organized when it comes to the messaging aspect. I have to search for conversations when I’m messaging people. Why does the most recent conversation not stay at the top of your list?   I’ve read the new algorithm is suppose to organize based off of what we would want to see. Like artificial intelligence. But hate to say, it’s wrong! this is not the order I would like my snap stories.   It’s just too much searching around For different things. I liked how it was separated prior with the stories posted newest oldest and your messaging was totally separate!   At least give us the option to choose which version we like more! Let us VOTE!!   Thanks for listening.   Sincerely,  @laylah36 
I like the fact that you can just pick stories, group, or all but you need to have the option for just messages. Because it said I had a message and it took forever to find it.
Please make Snapchat the way it used to be! This new update that will “make it better” made it worse
Sweet lord Jesus. Don’t do it. It’s trash. Use to be my favorite app now just opening it to clear out the notifications is a chore. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Update is trash I hate using snap now
I never review apps, and had to take time to review the new update. It is horrible. Snap, I hope you understand that simple is better!
I honestly hope they just switch it back to the old update because even the “newest update” is still trash . Nothing changed besides the separate stories . They should’ve left it alone to begin with , I hardly get on Snapchat now because the new updates are trash !
They really messed up the app. Stop trying so hard to change everything please, it’s disappointing
Snapchat should let us snapchat users to be able to see our own snaps we send to others snapchat users it would be really helpful, you guys should also separate the conversations from snap stories because since they are mixed together now i lost a lot of my streaks since i have trouble knowing who i have streaks with or not
Freaking app updated on its own. Super cluttered, really hard to see where anything is anymore. I’m barely using the app anymore. Seriously snapchat, what were you thinking?
Obviously a looooot of people hate this update. When are you going to do something about it???? Even the queen of Snapchat and most followed user, Kylie Jenner, says that she does not open the app anymore. How much does your stock need to fall for you to fix this update?   Sincerely, a lover of Snapchat filters, Asia 
I really love Snapchat! Are you so every day I barely even text anymore and it’s great. But the new update is absolutely awful. No one likes it and it is so hard to find anything. please come up with the new and improved update everyone would appreciate it. Thank you.
Snapchat “WAS” lit at first now it’s more complicated, and lame.  No one barely uses it anymore smh!! Go back to the old update
I've been an avid user of Snapchat for three years. Now I'm thinking about not using it because this update is so HORRENDOUS!
Hate the newest update. It is so cluttered and busy!
Thank you for fixing the update and separating friends’ stories from the messages.   The new format is still odd, because I liked having friends and the discover content all on one screen and the map on another. Now that there’s three pages to swipe between along with three individual tabs within the friends’ section feels like a bit much and uncomfortable to use. Also, the chronology of friends stories doesn’t make sense. I don’t see a sensible order.   But at least tweaks were made to that ridiculous update. Snapchat is better now but still doesn’t deserve 5 stars like the old  10.24 version. 
Snapchat used to be great, but the update completely ruined the app. Definitely abandoning Snapchat and going to instagram full-time.
Change the UI back to the old one. This new one is terrible.
I used to love using Snapchat but now with the new update everything is on one page, your chats don’t show up in order and it’s confusing to use. Most definitely not going to be using Snapchat as much as I used to anymore.
My Snapchat usage went from 85% to 0% because of this update.
The new update changed the whole format of the app, when the old version worked perfectly. No one cares to see stories of people they don’t even know. Now it’s almost impossible to talk to people who you regularly talk to on the app. Now people who you don’t even talk to are at the top of the messages. I suggest change it back to the way it was.
This is the worst update ever!! It’s way to complicated you could say but it’s not as fun as it used to be, I loved the old update. They just did another update and it’s not what we wanted💯🤦🏽‍♀️
Leave well enough alone. It’s fine to keep the bugs out but go back to how it was 2 weeks ago. This was the worst decision made by Snapchat
Tbh I hate this update I miss the old snap 🤷🏾‍♀️
this snapchat update makes it hard to use it. i hate the new layout.
I hate this new update on the Snapchat app I miss the old snap chat app where your names don’t pop up on the chat when you chat with your Snapchat friends please put the old Snapchat app back so Snapchat users don’t see their names in the Snapchat app when they chat with their Snapchat friends
You guys are honestly making this worse. I know you guys think that we will get over the new update but to be honest we aren’t. You guys are just losing more people each day and it’s sad. So coming from a person who uses Snapchat put it back to how it was of not I’m just gonna delete the app
I have been using snapchat for years and used to love snapchat but this update made me hate it. I don’t know why you even have a whole page for the discover tab and not one for the stories. Who the hell uses those that much to make you guys think that you would need a whole page for it like it outweighs the stories. I seriously have no idea why that was a good idea. Stories are one of the best features and you ruined it. Thanks
The new update is horrible. Cluttering the discovery section with “Celebrity” & “popular” stories.. really? Who cares about these people? I have never heard of half of the ones that show up on my feed.. And when you hold them down and select “see less like this” they disappear for a brief moment until you close and reopen the app and ... waallllla, they are right back at the top of the feed... major fail Snapchat.   Considering deleting after update. 
When you try to swipe to open a chat, it slides you over to the stories page now, instead of opening the chat with the person like you could in the past. Now if I want to open the chat to message someone without opening their snapchat photo, I can’t. I understand that it’s supposed to be easier to navigate than the last update, but now it has annoying little bugs like that. Also, when you type in a message on a photo and then try to slide it up, the trash icon pops up and if you slide it up above/next to it, your entire message deletes. Two very frustrating things.
Why snapchat? There was no need for the new update. This update clutters EVERYTHING! Like please keep my incoming snaps in chronological order. I don't want to see a 15 minutes ago after a 2 hours ago. Also, why must all the sent go after the received? Why were stories mixed on the same page as our personal snaps? Why can't we select the stories we want to see? What gave you the audacity to make my life 20 times more difficult? I just want to Snapchat my friends and family for fun. Now, I know people who are giving up on their streaks and deleting the app all together because they don't want to deal with this. Can you all PLEASE bring back the old format??? It would be much appreciated by all of your consumers. Also, I didn't like how the app automatically updated without us actually going to the App Store and updating Snapchat ourselves. While I'm at it, the new update is forcing bitmoji a little too much on everyone. Everything fills up too much space on this screen. I don't like how when you pull down the drop down on the middle circle, you can't view your best friend list. By the way, the best friend list was wayyyyy easier to see when the whole list was vertical. For such a big company, I am VERY disappointed and disgusted with this new update. I have not heard one person yet say, "Wow! I actually like the new Snapchat update!" And do you know why, because it's complex, cluttered, and inconvenient. Please make Snapchat casual again and go back to the old format!!!   p.s. No one would be mad if you went back to the old Snapchat! Plus, simple is better sometimes and don't always try to out do yourselves! My generation just wants a fun and chill app to share our social lives and keep in touch with some people. 
Bad update
I don’t like the new update change it back please
You guys are losing soooo many users from the update! change it back !
Loved it until the update now it’s ugly and weird I hate it and if if goes back to how it used to be it would be five stars PLEASE SNAPCHAT TAKE BACK THE UPDATE
Honestly wish I could give no stars. Hate the update. I wish it could go back to what it was. And the newest update closes my app out every time I try and snap. Very annoying. Snapchat used to be fun ☹️
This new update is terrible!!!it took me 5 mins to post a pic 🙄this is stupid!!!! I hate this app
This new update it terrible
The app has gone downhill ever sense they are changing everything with this app. Keep it simple.
Update is terrible. Don't even bother downloading this app and if you haven't updated just delete Snapchat
No one likes update just throw in trash and walk away and let it burn plz read and agree with me we don't like update lick me later
Snapchat was cool starting off but once the new snap update happens I hate snap chatting it’s stupid try to act like Instagram story bring back my old Snapchat
Snapchat used to be my absolute favorite app and since the new update, I have not been on it as much. The old version was so convenient because of the stories on one side and the conversations on the other. Now, the stories and conversations are on the same side and the stories that no one really cares about are on the other side. I just really wish the update never happened. Please change it back snapchat.
New update is trash.
I used to love SnapChat but it is horrible with the new update. I can’t even filter through the celebs I do follow and popular stories. Stick to IG and FB.
honestly idk who in the world changed the way snapchat used to be before this new weird update. I would politely like to request the old snap where the stories and chats were all on different screens. My views have gone down ever since the new update. I can’t find my friends stories because they’re all the way at the bottom or something. So pleaseeee bring the old snap back!!!
I been using snapchat forever and I love it but with this new update, EVERY. TIME. I try to respond to someone, the entire app crashes and I won’t be able to send anything
The new update is Horrible I used to use Snapchat everyday it was part of my Daily life now I barley use it . I get so confused, Change it to the old one and I could give u more stars
I had snapchat since 2014, when the app layout was simple and straight forward. Now the halo just seems cluttered and congested. I feel like snapchat inc. should go back to the format before it was redesigned but those are just my thoughts.
The update is nice because it separates celebrities from my friends. I love being able to see what my friends are doing and if I feel like watching celebrities, I have the option to. Snap is the best social media app
The update just made things super hard to follow I don’t even wanna use it anymore
Do not get me wrong, Snapchat has been and still is my favorite form of social media to this day. But this new update is bad, I find myself using snap less and less each day. Sometimes only when I get a text. I would kill for you guys to go back to the old Snapchat. It was sad to see you go from nearly 5 stars to 1.8 stars. Please change this, for the greater good of your company.
I dont know what the CEO is thinking he seems to be thinking like a man only  that everyone will just get use to this update we’ll news flash we’re not all men and some of us including celebrities do not care for this update no one wants to have the stories and are conversations in one place and if we all want to feel as though celebrities are our friends then that’s are right not yours to say we can’t feel that way . Who ever ends up with you I feel sorry for , you are not a man who will listen to what everyone is telling you . You will learn the hard way by losing a lot of people  including celebrities. Now look you lost Kylie now who’s sorry , looks like your going to lose a lot everyone told you , but you don’t listen
Not liking the new update. Not very user-friendly.
The latest update makes the app unusable. News flash, guys: you’re not Facebook, and nobody has to use your product.   I won’t miss the annoying, inane ads either. 
The new update is annoying, just the ways is setup I’m not a good fan of it .
I like this
After new upgrade it is considered as failure
New update 👎👎👎👎
Are used to like Snapchat a lot and I use it every day but after that update I did not like it at all
I like the app and use it pretty frequently to take pictures (whether they get uploaded to my Story or not). The only thing that I don’t like is this last update. I don’t like it all that much because it’s really confusing seeing the typical Stories in the Discover section but none of my friends nor mine. I think that we should have that feature back (having our Story and our friends’ Stories in the Discover part) so that it’s less confusing for all of us. I also try to hide the stories in the Discover section that I don’t want to see, but then they come back as they’re updated. Although this is the case, I do like that I can switch through the photos and videos in my Memories really quickly and easily.
RIP Snapchat
We hate the app joe fix itttttt
You need to change it back to the old update    Cause if u keep this new update I guarantee u that you’ll go out of business  this update stupid
I loved Snapchat until the new update dropped. I and everyone I know are not a fan of the new update from what I have observe. The stories should be separate from the snaps and messages and on a different screen like they used to be.
I think snap co had deafness all the users complain of the app and they still argent to them
So Snapchat used to be an amazing app intill they updated it and ruined everything now I have started using Instagram more cause atleast they aren’t forcing updates
The new Snapchat is actual trash. Please just bring the old version back. I don’t want to see random stories from people I DONT follow. I can’t even find content from people I do follow. Also, I keep accidentally going into chat mode instead of clicking on stories. 10/10 a no.
nah.   fam. 
Snapchat was a pretty good app, but now with this update it's not. I personally really dislike this update. It ruins the app the thing that bothers me the most is how the stories appear in the chat section so now there is a whole section for ads called "discovery" it pisses me off. The only reason I still have this app is for my streaks.
The happy see to be good ten they put that new update and I don’t get anything intill a hot layer it not good anymore I about to delete t then app was great but then they made it were it useless
Ever since this update I can’t stand using Snapchat. They really lost it when they changed everything. Not even worth having.
The new update is just awful. It makes me not want to use Snapchat  anymore.
Bring back the old update this new update its confusing and not as exiting. No one likes this new update idk why they haven't changed it.
horrible app
I use to love the app till the new update came out! EVERYONE ELSE FEELS THIS WAY! Pls change it back before it turns out dead like MySpace
The I have tried to get used to the update but I just can't. I don't even want to open the app anymore. I used to slide ride to watch all my friends stories and now sliding right is all the stuff I never watched anyways, and my friends stories are cluttered on my conversations page. Bottom line this update is trash.
I am very upset. I have not yet updated the app and was planning not to because of everyone else's reaction. Today I opened the app and somehow it changed on its own. I do not like the new change and now I'm stuck with it when I didn't even update it !!!
I recently got the new update and I absolutely hate it! Please creators of Snapchat change it back to the way it was. Almost all Snapchat users hate this update. It’s too confusing and cluttered.  Also there is no friends list. When I text someone their name doesn’t stay at the top it gets moved around whenever someone post something in their story. The stories and chats in the same page are too confusing. Please change it back to the way it used to be.
I had written a nicely worded review about the new Snapchat update, however that got deleted so I’ll make this short. The update itself isn’t that bad..it’s trash. Snaps I just sent and just opened go all the way to the bottom. Story’s are hard to find, and no one cares about the explore page. I just updated it again yesterday and now it has this swipe thing that changes it from story’s to groups. It’s a cool feature but I don’t like it. You can’t slide over into peoples chats anymore. You just have to tap it. I don’t think changing the layout of Snapchat was a good idea. Everything is small and cluttered in one page. Please keep in mind that many people are unhappy with this change and take into consideration maybe changing it not all the way back but at least separate the story’s from the sending and receiving snaps page. Like I said it’s just too cluttered.
Absolutely NOT happy with the new update. I barely even use Snapchat anymore because I can’t tell who messaged me and who posted a story. I used to be able to have the person I was talking to be at the top but if I’m having a conversation and someone posts a story and I go in the page I can’t find who I was talking to. I hate this update. A barely even use Snapchat anymore. Worst thing ever. I will probably be deleting soon
Go back to the old format
Since the update Snapchat is always crashing for me
I hate this update, I don’t see stories from the people I actually follow or friends now just people I have no interest in or random strangers. It’s so cluttered and annoying
This update is trash completely ruined the app change it back to the old one.
pls change it back, the old design of snapchat was user friendly and i liked it. now it is confusing and annoying to have chats and stories on the same screen. it doesn’t make it more convenient or whatever.
This new update is awful. It is so hard to find anything. Any story you were previously subscribed to see you have to search for now, which makes me just not want to use the app anymore. It isn’t user friendly. And my app became so much slower now because it is loading these *popular* stories from people I don’t know about and don’t care about. Plus having the stories from your friends in your message area is just dumb. The old set up worked out much better. If something wasn’t broken why try to fix it.  The only positive is changing the fonts and adding multiple captions. But that doesn’t outweigh the awful setup.   If they go back to an easier more user friendly version I will go back to Snapchat. But I gave it a week with the new app (since that’s pretty much what it is, a new app) and as of now I’m done. 
I don’t care the news in my Snapchat, I just want a part where are all my stories, the new ones and the old ones that I already see, snap news is crap take off it
New format due to the update has our friends moving to other apps!
We don't like the new update 😕
This new update is terrible. Please change to the old one.
I was on snap daily before this awful upgrade happened. I have to watch the same stories over over to get to the new ones. Soni just stopped. Undo this update please it's awful
The new update is pure, hot garbage. Get a better UI/UX designer and try actually using it before you push it to millions of users. It’s no bueno 😭
Snapchat was great the WAY IT USED TO BE. Why did it have to get so complicated to use! I hate the new update. Although I won’t be deleting my account, I will be deleting the app. Instagram is more convenient, and at first I would still use Snapchat but ever since the update you guys are really making me consider never using Snapchat again. So Let me know when and if it will ever go back to it’s original setting!👍🏽 #BITTERSWEETGOODBYE
I enjoyed using the app with friends mainly because of the fun filters. However, the new layout is just awful. I wish they would’ve left it the way it was. Change isn’t always bad, but it’s not always good either. It’s frustrated me to the point of rating it a one star. I’ll be glad to change the review if they can improve it, but ad of now I simply prefer to not use the app as much.
Dear Snapchat,  I don’t think you realize that EVERYONE HATES THE NEW UPDATE! The fact that you’re trying to make everyone like it takes a lot of guts, but no one is enjoying the update. I certainly am not enjoying it. I’d like to watch/listen to my friends’ stories as I was getting ready for school or for bed because the stories never stopped in between each person. Now, the stories stop between each person and I can’t do what I was once able to do. It’s not the end of the world and I realize that but it is very annoying since you haven’t changed the format of Snapchat back to its previous glory. The current format is still very confusing and I do not like it at all. If you could please change the format back to the old one, I know I’m not the only one who would rate you 5 stars again. Thank you for your time.      Sc username      d-fittje 
Ok... To be honest, the new updates are just trash. Everything is just jumbled up and there's hardly any organization. It's more difficult to find conversations, they brought back the endless stream of public snap stories, I can't peak into a conversation anymore without fully opening it, but to top it all off, you can now buy custom filters. I thought I'd give that a try but when I saw the $119.00 price tag, I laughed because this is getting so out of hand so quickly. I guess what I'm trying to say is... BRING OLD SNAPCHAT BACK THIS OBVIOUSLY ISNT WORKING OUT. 
It’s confusing!!!!! I hate it!!!!!
Can we please get the new update back...
Is this what you call an update? Making the interface more confusing is far from being an improvement. The layout was fine the way it was. Snapchat needs to rethink its strategies.
I have used Snapchat in the past, and I love it! It gives you many options from texting people to posting pictures or videos of your daily life, WITH FILTERS! But this recent update is super confusing! If they put it back to the older version I would give this app a 4 star rating! The new update makes it hard to see people’s story’s, many of my friends don’t like it either. But it is a great app, they just have to fix a few things!
Since the app auto updated, everything is unorganized. I used to post to my story and watch my friend’s stories, but now I don’t even use that feature anymore. Disappointed.
I HATE THE UPDATE PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK
That app was fine the way it was before... you guys need to undo this garbage and bring it back to what it used to be...
all my favorite filters are gone. fix it.
Keep the fonts and the new Bitmoji but change the layout back to the other layout. The new layout is aggravating and annoying. You made it worst than better!!
Literally hate everything about the new update. Sorry to whoever worked really hard on it. Great idea but honestly why must we continuously change things??? Just leave well enough alone. I like the addition of the bitmojis to contacts names but HATE how stories are mixed in with everything. Makes it way to hard to find everything. It feels so jumbled. I like having everything sorted out. Makes me a little OCD. Been a user since Fall 2012. Don’t start getting complicated now. Change it back!! PS please like just change it back to how it was and we can all pretend like this new update never happened! 
New update is terrible.
I hate the update reverse it please
Snapchat got worse! Whats going on with all these updates? We want the old snapchat back!!!
I never go on it anymore. Thanks a lot
l’ll probably end up deleting the app. The new update gets a 👎🏼! Put it back to the way it was! Or a lot of people will delete! ✌🏼
if i could give 0 stars i would. i used to love snapchat, and now i hardly use it. the new update has tainted the snapchat name, and i am disgusted. please return it back to the old snapchat. what are you doing snapchat.
This update is trash , definitely uninstalling . You guys took something that was completely fine like it was and made it horrible
Okay the new update has some good things but why are we mixing the stories together on the same side. It’s confusing and looks stupid. Please change it back to the normal snap that everyone misses
I hate this so much there’s literally no point in even using this application anymore. No one asked for this update and no one wants it. You better stop this madness. What are you doing Snapchat check yourself because at this point you’ve already recked yourself.
Your renewal of Snapchat is absolutely horrific. The easiness or finding stories before was so great, fix your app and bring what we had back please! You guys should know it is garbage by your 1.8 star rating. Smh
This app is amazing but the new update is trash! So can you go back to the new update?
I used to love snapchat but the last update is so confusing, I totally dislike it.
At the beginning Snapchat was the most used app I have ever got. But the new update is very difficult to use and puts in center of the Publisher and very well-known people  which the friends should be there, and now is‘ that’s to know which friend uploaded a story which you already watched so in conclusion this is the worst Snapchat have ever had 
Snapchat was my favorite social media App until they decided to update the sh*t. Its so unorganized with the recent people you messaged and your actually followers. I use to get so many views but now I get only a few in 1 hour🧐! They tried to be like Instagram & updated the app to be better however I believe it was perfect the old way! I don't even care about the popular page... a bunch of nobodies with large following! Change IT BACK WE DONT WANT THIS UPDATE!!!!!!!!
Since the update I can’t even use Snapchat because it’s to cluttered and unorganized
So I enjoy how the newest update has more options like “groups, stories, all” but you should also just make a conversation portion so we can just have an option to focus on who we’re talking to instead of who is updating their story. Because it like refreshes when somebody posts and then our conversation gets lost. Which is really irritating. The new improvement was good though, just could be better with a conversations option. 
I love Snapchat but this new update is what I hate
snapchat keeps losing my streaks when people already sent them
The fact that the CEO of snapchat said they “will not go back to the old update ever” shows the stupidity behind the company and the new design. I can’t think of a single person that likes this update. It is clear that the company is losing a ton of money, and if they continue to not reverse it I’m sure snapchat won’t be used by anyone.
This new update is horrible can you change it back?
I loved Snapchat when It first come out but now I hate what has happened to it.stupid boring update to the point where I had to uninstall it
what is the new update
Fix it, i love snapchat the old one until you came with this automatic update . no one likes it , your rating is going down, so fix it .
I have had Snapchat for 3 years and the new update is the worst! The old one was the bomb.com but the new update just messed up everything. It's disorganized and the snap icons are too tiny so I have to squint to read them! My eyeballs are slowly dying just because of the new update! Don't get!
This update is terrible still
CHANGE IT BACK ... SO SELFISH ALL SNAPCHAT IS CONCERNED ABOUT Is MONEY AND ADVERTISING.. THE UPDATE Is HORRIBLE CAN NOT EVEN PUT IT INTO WORDS CHANHE IT BACK CHANGE IT GHANGE GHANGCE GHANGE CHANGE
What good is updating your app for advertisement revenue if you have no consumers to keep that revenue? A lot of people at snapchat need to be fired.
Bring the old Snapchat back oh my god
Terrible update
Why all the unnecessary bs adding they've been doing? Money. That's the only reason. Will be uninstalling. Sellouts.
Take the hint Snapchat that your users do NOT like the new update, including myself who actually deactivating my account. It’s just not worth the hassle with this app now. Y’all changed it and refuse to change it back. Well it’s your lost when y’all go bankrupt. Enjoy
Are you kidding me everything is just really really bad
This new update is awful! I used to love Snapchat. Everyday I use little less, I see myself deleting this app soon!
Absolutely do not like the new changes !
Lastest update is despicable, never asked for it, NEVER WANTED IT! Once again I ask; change it now please! Not ONE person, NOT ONE has said they liked this new update, and you know why...? Because it’s the WORST UPDATE EVER!! So people over moving on to Instagram in the meanwhile.
Because of the new update snapchat really  got bored
I used to loveeee snapchat 😩 but then this update cameee!!!! And ruined everything!!!!  Please bring back our OLD SNAPCHAT 🤲🏽❤️ 
I have lost 3 streaks, 2 of them being above 350 in the last week for no reason and no notification/timer. The new update is trash. I am heavily considering deleting snapchat.
Failed update
If zero stars was an option I would give you that. This update is awful.
Basically everything that all the other one stars are saying but one more constructive critique. The stories page now has endless scrolling which is terrible. Endless scrolling cause app addiction. PEOPLE WERE ALREADY ADDICTED TO SNAPCHAT. Plus with the new set up showing popular people's stories it makes it very hard to find the stories you actually want.
i don’t think you guys understand why everyone hates this update so much. we want sTORIES AND SNAPS TO SEPARATE. and your little update you had last night didn’t make anything better because instead of swiping to see your friends chats you have to tap them! almost everyone who uses the app doesn’t open all their snaps considering they’re all streaks, so if we just wanted to open their chat we’d have to click through all their snaps first. and i can’t tell if someone sent me a snap or if they posted on their story! bitmojis make everything 10x messier, and so do the stories you put by a person’s name. nobody looks for a bitmoji when searching for a friend. we all can read, and the bitmojis aren’t even accurate to say the least. change it back to the old update.
Change it back to the way it was everyone hates it and you aren’t doing anything about it
Everytime snap makes an update the app gets worse . Put it back to the old snap and nobody will complain.
I’ve loved Snapchat since I got it years ago but this new update is terrible. It’s been updated for a few weeks now on my phone and I’m still not use to it, so “I’ll take some time to get use to it” is not the case this time. The entire update is just not user friendly and hard to navigate. I hate it. If I could give y’all negotiable stars I would. Fix it!
The update is still terrible. Half of the app is tabloid garbage.
I don’t mind Snap inc updating their product. Just don’t force people. The a reason why we have the “don’t update automatically option “ stop bypassing my choice just because you can. 😡
I used to love Snapchat, but the new update is horrible. It's cluttered and hard to find things. I find myself using Snapchat less and less. Bring back the old Snapchat!
App redesign is bogus I hope they loose money
I knew the new update sucked so I didn’t update my Snapchat. I guess Snapchat decided for me that I needed to update and did it for me. Done using Snapchat I’ve deleted the app
Go back to the old snapchat before you all go poor
Put stories back to chronological order
So regarding the new update as of 2/23/2018 it’s still difficult to use. You can’t slide to open chats, you have to tap, and sometimes when you tap, it slides over. I think it was a bad idea to update the WHOLE LAYOUT of your app, and now your rating is 1.8 stars... when you were at a nearly five star rating before the update.
bring the old version back !!
Everything was so simple and smooth to use before this update and now I don’t even want to get on snap anymore.
Please destroy this update. I will pay you guys to make the horror stop
How did you guys manage to make this version worse?
Bring back the old Snapchat
I understand you want to keep with the times and update your app, but this is preposterous. The app is very difficult to navigate. I don’t know if I’m getting a personal snap or a public one from my friends. I don’t know how to view stories again and I hate how on the subscription section there are celebrities and people I don’t even follow on there. I’m using it less and less and will probably make the full switch to Instagram. RIP Snapchat you were amazing while it lasted.
I woke up to the most horrid sight in the world.... the updated Snapchat.... I was just dandy with my old snap.... the new one is glitchy asf
This new update is so over designed! It passed right over being intuitive and jumped to being infuriating. Noting makes sense, buttons do nonsensical things, and everything good about previous designs is gone. Wait to download until they realize their mistake and roll these changes back.
Snapchat has gotten worse since the update. It’s really bad and everyone dislikes it. Can you please change it back to the old one?
Can I leave less than one star?
snapchat is anysome app!
...why?
The new Snapchat update is horrible. Haven’t been on my Snapchat since they combined stories with my inbox. Hate it. Ruined a good thing.
Snapchat will not let me log in , and it’s not letting me verify my number
i loved snapchat but once the new update came along (both) it is supper bad the only reason i go on now is to send streaks it used to be a fun app but now it’s terrible i actually hate it is there anyway you could reverse it because the rating use to be a 4 out of 5 stars but now it is 1.8 out of 5
Used to be so much better when it was simple. DOING WAY TOO MUCH SNAPCHAT
Please help me and my friend lost our streak please bring it back her snap name is cammy.rh
I have stopped using snapchat at this point cause of how much I cant stand the update and I know pretty much everyone feels the same way. JUST CHANGE IT BACK
New update is just badddd, it used to be so smooth and simple but y’all had to mess it up.
You need to turn off the auto play feature of stories on the discover page. There’s maybe 3 stories there that I watch. Also, if there’s a quick one I want to watch, it finishes and starts playing the next longer one. If I want to go back and watch the longer one from the start later that day, it doesn’t start at the beginning. It starts after the first few screens that I accidentally watched because it auto played earlier!!
Absolutely hate the new update go back to the old version
How do you have a new update and it is now worse then the last one ?!!! I can honestly say I hate snapchat now .
Snapchat I love to use your app but I don’t really like the new update enough that I’m writing this review...
Too much going on! Separate chats and stories. You used the page stories were on just to get more revenue? Must be nice. And dump the reason people use Snap all on one page and let them sort it out. Not user friendly. I don’t chat with everyone on my list. So it was nice to have my list of chats all on one page. Now I just “clear conversations” to get the page to look clean. Oh well.
Hope you develop snapchat to the better
Stop trying to make the new update worst, just bring the old one back!!!!.  I don’t want to see any of those “fashionista or social media AH”. 
The new update on where you can view stories is trash!!!!!! All of my viewers went down because of this stupid update! Everyone Ik complains about it
Very very very bad what’s that?.
Bring back the old version of Snapchat this thing is horrible ....
Snapchat you losing people 💔👎🏼
Take five minutes with the new layout, get to know it and you will get it. You would think if you are a celebrity you would actually like it more. The truth is the app actually does a lot more than you think and is easier to navigate. It is the best and most fun app to use when connecting with your friends. The Discover side is only going to get better with more publishers and shows coming. The latest update adding tabs separating your subscriptions from everything else is a definite plus. They will continue to clean it up and make it more aesthetically pleasing, but the separation of your close friends from professional (or wannabe professional) content is how it should be in my opinion. When I only want to communicate with my friends or catch up on what they are doing, I don’t want any of the other content on my screen space and vice versa. Snap is original. Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, copies everything they do. Posers should not be rewarded.
I hate the new update
Hey Snapchat!! I’ve been using this app since I was like 14. I absolutely love it! This specific update may have been a flop for almost all your users but that’s okay. There are certain things I love about the new update. Like the multiple captions, and the set up is nice. I’d like the stories to go back the way they used to be though, other wise I like how it’s set up. When every other social media has failed me, Snapchat was always there. Thank you!
I’m sorry to say, I don’t use Snapchat as often as I did due to the update. I find it difficult to use and even with the celebrities I follow. It seems like i miss most of the feeds because I have to search for them and then an ad pops up? What?! It’s annoying now. Please change it back or fix this.
Snapchat was great. The first update, was trash but the second one. Is the worst. I am so sick of Snapchat raping my phone without its consent. STOP MAKING IT WORSE. Go back to the old version before everyone gets used to it.
Now theres another update and when i get a chat from somebody i cant swipe half way to see what they wrote without opening the whole chat and i really need that im pretty im not the only one who does that, So please bring it back 😩
I don’t understand why I’m losing all of my streaks. I’ve Snapchated then and they have Snapchated me but then the little hourglass is still sitting there and waiting. I’m starting to get really disappointed in Snapchat...
Read the title
This update literally makes it harder to use. Then they updated it again to make it “better”  but in reality only made it harder.   Snapchat claims the new update is to make it easier to connect, but I disagree. I’m seriously thinking about deleting it, which is sad because it was something I used all day and thoroughly enjoyed. 
This is by far the absolute WORST update ever, to cluttered, to confusing and I HATE how that snaps are not in order by the time they were posted their just all over the place!!
My app keeps on closing and your changing things too fast people in general don’t like change you got to ease them into it. By not listening to the people your driving your company or Snapchat into the ground. Your stock prices will continue to plummet and Snapchat will die like vine
This update is so unorganized and all over the place and just cluttered unnecessarily. I don't like that I have to have a convo with someone to see their story and then if I try to watch someone's story that I don't have a convo with it'll refresh itself and then I lose. I liked the old version WAY better because it was more separated and didn't feel so all over the place, it was simple. I don't see myself using snap as much I did with this new update honestly 😅🙅🏻  Update: still hate the update. Change it back. 
I don’t understand why snapchat felt the need to change the entire layout. Especially to a less effective version. It is hard to navigate and overall confusing. It makes me no longer want to use or open the app.
STOP BRAINWASHING CHILDREN WITH LEFTIST PROPAGANDA. STOP BEING RACIST TO WHITE PEOPLE. EVERYDAY SNAPCHAT IS PUSHING RACISM TOWARDS WHITE PEOPLE AND LEFTIST INSANITY. SNAPCHAT IS A CORRUPT CIA PSYOP NOW, IT IS NOT A FUN APP ANYMORE.
I dont like the update well I like it but I like the other Snapchat I’m saying this because I don’t want your company to go down thank you for understanding.
I hate that the influencers or celebs that I follow are basically disregarded and I’m forced to follow people that I chose not to follow. I wish Snapchat would separate the public pages you want to see from those you don’t want to see. Seems like they’re just trying to force views.
Undoooooo this updateeee
Put it back I cant even slide and secretly read messages anymore
The update is pure crap & an infringement on my privacy.
Even after the update I was a little disappointed but that didn’t stop me from using Snapchat.
The old Snapchat was way better in comparison and all my friends agree with me. Please allow us to change back.
Cool
I feel like yall shouldnt force people to update yall losing a lot of users just change it back dummies😴
Bring the old view back!!!! @Snapchat, you don’t read reviews? You customers are upset!!! You don’t care?!!! 
So I’m giving this a 2 Star because this app on its old update I would have given it a 5 Star. I love this application but ever since this new update I’ve been using it less... I know you guys are trying to have something new but it’s just not cutting it. Please revert back to the old update thanks.
This new update is killing me. It’s more frustrating to text people you want and view their story & with sending streaks. The old update was fine. The new update is extra asl😂.
Stop updating the app u r making it worse
Recently my snapchat updated by itself to this ugly as* , difficult format. since then it has become harder to find friends and find the people i want. CHANGE THIS SH*T BACK
You guys really messed up with this one. Why fix what’s not broken  Been a few weeks now. Still awful, extremely slow to open and load, probably because of all the extra junk u guys clutter the stories with. I don’t care about people I’m not following, thanks for wasting my time snapchat. 
Like everyone else i want to go back to the old simple layout. It was so easy to control and easy to remember. The new layout its hard and its more difficult for people to look at their friends stories, but nonetheless it’s a great app.
Complete junk. About to delete the app
The new update is absolutely awful and all I see is ads constantly. Snap chat isn’t worth it anymore, its basically an advertising agency. Deleting it at this point.
Please give us back the old version of Snapchat. Please undo these two new updates. I don’t use Snapchat as often anymore & this is the reason why.
This update doesn’t even deserve one star. Please bring back old snapchat.
I don’t know why they haven’t changed it back with all the backlash it’s gotten but this update is the worst. Everything is in places that just make no sense. The only good thing that came from this update is the ability to change the fonts. Just move everything back to where it was!
i got used to the update and what not but i wish that snapchat made it where you could choose peoples placements on your bestfriends list without having to snapchat them 50 times a day
I,hate a update
No longer a user. Erased your stupid app from my phone. You refuse to go back to your basic design so I refuse to have your app on my phone. Thanks for ruining one of my favorite social media sites.
This update is completely illogical. On the tab where you send snaps to your friends, the list used to be in the order you snap chatted them most recently. Now, it’s in the order of when they updated their story most recently. Snapchat, what?? Imagine if in the iPhone messaging app, instead of organizing the texts in the order that you texted each person most recently, the list was organized such that which ever contact texted someone else most recently was at the top. So every time you open the app it’s just a bunch of new, random people. Extremely frustrating and very difficult to use.
Your getting a lot of hate Bc of the new update if you want more money and 5 stars give us back the normal Snapchat #bringbacksnapchat!
I don’t know what Team Snapchat thought would come out of this new update, but no one likes it. It’s complicated, squished together and unnecessary. Bring back the page specifically for friend’s stories, and keep the new chat features.   You’re losing money, accept you made a bad mistake (not a bad thing at all), but do what your customers want and change back. 
This update is complete garbage. Many users have stopped using this app due to the newest update. Everyone used to love snapchat and have fun with it but now it is just so annoying. I have been a user of snapchat for over 5 years and I have been through many updates and all were great. But this one makes me want to delete snapchat. Snapchat makers, please fix this because many people do not like it and are going to stop using what once was an awesome app everyone loved.
i miss the old update. the new update when someone snapchats you you have to scroll to find it and miss having the stories on another page. i like the old layout of snapchat
Okay so snap update is trash all except the gifs, and the new fonts and multiple captions . That’s great but he rest is booty . I really need to be able to change to be pink flower crown because a lot of people miss it .please. Thanks you
I am glad Snapchat made it so we can see stories. Great job Snapchat!!
The new updates discourages people to use the app in general. The interface isn’t as enjoyable as it used to be. It’s hard to notice what’s going on and it’s just too much. I love Snapchat and I want to continue to enjoy it. This recent update has pushed me away from the app. Please change Snapchat back to how it used to be. Thank you
I understand the separation of he celebrities from regular people .... but I no longer can see everybody snaps, I thought I lose a few friends and I search their name ... they’re there snaps and all I just haven’t saw them !!    Please separate the messages and the stories again ! That’s all I want ! It’s easier to keep up that way.
I’m sure this isn’t the first you’ve heard it and it surely won’t be the last, but the new update is horrendous. I have one significant complaint to add to the pile though. I am friends with this girl on snapchat and I definitely don’t mind her. Although, we do not snap each other at all. Yet, this new update has somehow bookmarked her story into my stories I like to see like Buzzfeed, Vice, etc.. Every time I see it, I hold it in and select “See less like this,” which would normally mean that I probably shouldn’t be seeing it again. Well guess what Snapchat, whenever this girl posts anything on her story, guess what I see at the top of my Discover list? I’m sure you could take a good guess. Fix it please. Thank you.
The new Snapchat update has deeply saddened me. My favorite app has become a confused mess. I sorely miss the stories screen and it needs to be brought back. I don't think I can use it anymore otherwise :(
اخس تحديث بالحياة !!!! 💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔 
I do not like the new dates in Snapchat. Wish they could change it back
Why make such a HUGE mistake with such a terrible update, I guess I’ll be using My IG account more
Hate the new update!!! Dislike that you can't double tap to send anymore. It’s just terrible!
Was formerly a great app, until they decided to give it the worst update to a social media platform. Ugly, messy, confusing, and useless are words I would use to describe it now. Less and less people use it every day, now only a dozen or so people I know even try to use it. Not worth even having anymore, might as well go to Instagram.
Snapchat has made some pretty bad updates before but this is just horrible. So messy and cluttered, the explore page is awful and I can’t find what I actually want. And I’ve accidentally sent messages twice already. FIX THIS @SNAPCHAT
i opened my snapchat this morning after having the new update for about a week or so to see it had updated again and will not let me see my snapchats without having to close the app and open it about 5-6 times. then it says tap to load, i do, says tap to view and goes straight back to tap to load again, this needs to be fixed immediately
Snapchat is an awesome app and I love it but the new update is horrible. It is more difficult and confusing. PLEASE bring the old Snapchat back😔
Hate hate hate this update!!
Just change the app back to the way it way , y’all mf drunk ash , can’t you just read the reviews
Horrible update on Snapchat it’s very confusing. I have been using snapchat for a very long time but this update is the worsts. Please change it back.
This update has literally ruined Snapchat. I hate the app know. What where you guys thinking. You couldn’t make Snapchat anymore difficult to us know. Thanks. These guys better change it back or people are going to stop using it. Great job Snapchat, great job.👎🤬
We hate the new update. Please go back to the old one.. we miss old you.
This update is horrible nobody likes it 💯 and if you want to get people to get back on Snapchat turn it back to the old one because people are deleting snap chat because no one likes it no more and its always acting up so sometimes i have to delete the app so please turn it back to the old Snapchat before snap disappear.
This new style seems weird I personally don’t like it at all
I love this app and your filters were amazing but you changed them and now they are getting worse so can you bring back the good filters again please thanks still love at app tho!!
Snapchat was a good app until the update came in but I still use but it’s hard
Seriously just go back to the original Snapchat you cannot make this better
This update is horrible. I used to love the separation of it all, now everything is clumped together and stupid. You say that celebrities aren't my friends, then why are some of my friends in the celebrities tab? I also don't want to follow celebrities I didn’t follow originally. Just change it back already
Bring back the old design please
I only use Snapchat these days to keep the streaks going. The update has caused my phone to crash so many times it just locks up and drains my battery life. The only aspects I like about the new update is the new bitmoji appearance and being able to ignore some people’s stories that I don’t care to watch. I also think that once you view their story unless you had a prior conversation with them, it should clear from your feed.
The new look is confusing. I don't use Snapchat at all now after the last update. I even consider deleting the app since it's only taking up space now.
All of my friends and I hate this update. If you don't want to lose to instagram, change it back!
As of the new update my front facing camera no longer works. The whole point of snap chat is to snap a photo then talk about it! Please fix this problem ASAP I have a IPhone 7 Plus.
Ever since the new update I am going to delete this app. I hate the new way you have to look at story’s and now how much they advertise the stupid new stories.
I loved Snapchat before the recent changes in format now it’s way more difficult to use and it’s confusing
ppl don’t write reviews on the app store ! why y’all have 700k+++??  i checked snapchats rating right after the update was released and there were about 400k and just a week later many many people have reviewed and the apps rating has only gone down. yet here we are still with this trash update. about to delete !!! snapchat is so fake for this !
The update is infuriating for me to look at so much that im deleting the app very soon. I ended all my streaks and im done. Everyone hates the update why font they just reverse it.
👎🏻👎🏻
The update of course is the only reason this app was ever a problem for me! It’s messy and out of order that people who I haven’t snapped in week are at the top of my page instead of my most recent contacts. The stories are on the left side where the bitmojis are but when you click on the left side of their contact it takes you to their chat so it’s more annoying and difficult to use. Separate the stories from the snap page and move them back because I never use that other page now so it’s pointless
We need it back. The old one back. Bring bestfriend back and I feel like you should keep streaks.
The new update is horrible! Hard to find the chats I have with individuals-now it's a jumbled mess.
I’m glad Kylie made that tweet because hopefully you guys will listen now. We as users write reviews constantly and you don’t take heed to our reviews when it comes to “upgrading” your app! 🙄.... if it ain’t broke don’t fix it
Snapchat was fun till they added the new update. I kinda don’t want to have it anymore.
Snapchat is an amazing app the only thing i think is not really great about it is it used to have a lot of filters to choose from and they always changed the filters and now it has had the same couple of filters for about a month
Can I please get the new update
i love snapchat don't get me wrong. the new update was trash at first but then i got used to it. but of course it could use some adjustments. then i saw the newer update where they had a story section which is a great idea since it's kinda like that old one. BUT THEN I REALIZED, YOU CAN'T SLIDE THE CHATS ANYMORE. so now i have to click to open. i can't peep to see what the person says without opening it anymore. you literally just ruined everyone's lives. that feature was VERY important like you could duck everything else up but that feature never. but oh wait yall did so thanks !! im giving it two stars cuz i aint tryna be a beach ya kno. that's why i'm using beach and duck rather than actual curse words but if yall keep this up, prepare yourself for a v angry letter.
I recently have encountered a bug. When I receive a notification telling me a Snapchatter had added me I click the added me button but then the app closes
This update is useless. All the fonts & stickers don’t make up for the confusing way to navigate to watch & up load stories. Give us the old Snapchat back.
This new update is horrible what where u guys thinking?! Smh.
I used to use Snapchat constantly. However, since the most recent update, I’ve noticed a decline in the amount of times I’m actually using the app throughout the day. I don’t find this update to be user friendly.   I really enjoy Snapchat and wish the old format (or at least something closer to) would come back! 
Haaaaaaatttttteeeee! I repeat I HATE the new update. I think it’s best to just delete the app.
I cancelled auto-updates so I didn’t get it but today, I got it today. It is the most ugly thing I have ever seen. Please, for the love of my relationships, please, please, please, take the new update back.
Thank you for remaking it! It works a lot better and I understand it better now!
The first update with the Bitmoji maps was okay but the latest update has made everyone feel like they lost all their friends , we want the d Snapchat back where we can see all our friends and have a snapfeeds organized , NOTHING IS LIKE IT USED TO BE .
These new updates are still making it hard to navigate and the ap is incredibly slow!
The new update is terrible! It feels so cluttered and I can’t find all of my friends to send snaps to. Snapchat used to be fun, now I’d rather avoid it.
I loved snap when i chose who's snap I wanted to watch and in what ever order the update makes me not use the app as much its confusing & boring the tv and instagram already talk about celebs and show me celebs all day I would really like to see my friends stories and ppl that I know Im going to delete the app
As a loyal user of Snapchat for the past five years, it is completely mind blowing that the app refuses to listen to their users. This isn't a Facebook update everyone will forget about, this update is trash and the opposite of user friendly. Everyone will stop using this app if they keep ignoring the user.
I don’t like the new layout of stories or how you have to find your friends stories.
This update is way too extra and complex. It’s just not necessary. The old Snapchat was much easier to navigate around. You could have done the updates without changing the entire layout, it’s too much.
Not s fan off new update
First of all, Snapchat is a great app but changes need to be done. First of all why does Snapchat glitch me out when I try to take a photo!?????? Second, the new Snapchat is TOO annoying and complicated, go back to the version that everyone likes🤗! Because I quote              “ Snapchat is just sad “
I knew the last update was the worst decision ever made but this new one jfc i’ve been just telling my friends to email me bc  its easier than getting around snapchat
okay so i seriously dislike the new update, it’s so hard to use. this morning, i woke up and lost my first and only 100 streak and ton of my other streaks. i sent a streak to everyone last night, i don’t get the issue!?
Still horrible app only glance at it every once in awhile fb, instagram and Twitter is where it’s at now
You got to be kidding me Snapchat back it again with trying to do things you shouldn’t the world is already mad at you for making the update trash and then you want to make it 10 times worse I’m seriously about to delete this Snapchat what in your right mind made you think about the stupid update it’s stupid but you’re stupid companies and stupid Idiots who are coming up with the stupid ideas on how to make Snapchat this is pissing me and everybody else in the world are fix it OK fix it because I can’t half swipe how my supposed to know if somebody text me and I don’t open it because I don’t leave them open the main point is that it is with everybody like that everybody used and I did was take it I’m dressed like a wet rug I’m sick and tired of it I’m sick and tired of the shenanigans pissing me off I’m going to get another app somewhat like Snapchat before you messed it up and I hope you reconsider and fixed your act because you are ugly you smell like butter cream pie and I’m sick and tired of this good day Snapchat not really because I hope you’ve a terrible day because you’re making everybody else of a terrible day without the old Snapchat update fix it it’s 2018 come on get your act together
I don't know why y'all complain the update is nice I had it before y'all (beta tester)🤟🏼 It was just fine you just have to get use to it for you to like it💯💯💯💯
Do not like the update need to go back to the old one . It’s very confusing
Can I give this zero stars?... update is terrible
I hate that each time someone updates their story my chats gets moved down. Or that if someone i sent a chat to posted a story I can’t see if they opened my message or not without swiping. The snapchat update all is so laggy that I barely use it anymore when I used to use it for everything, pictures, texting, calling and news. If there was anything below 0 stars i’d give them -10 stars.
The new update is horrible I didn’t like it it’s so messy and confusing I used to open Snapchat all the time like every 5 min after the new update I don’t open it I didn’t like it sorry u must return the old Snapchat!
Your snap story UI is horrendous.
1st When are y’all going change how to view the stories again? I’m sure you’ve been getting Bad reviews about that update! We’re waiting!  2nd The update yesterday made my Snapchat start running bad! What’s going on People😡 Snap is my favorite Social Media, GET IT TOGETHER OKAY! Thank You! 
I really have enjoyed Snapchat, but lately all these updates are making this app more confusing. I miss the way this app used to be. So please, change Snapchat back to the way it was before all of these updates.
Dear Snapchat,  What happened? Why did you take your simple interface and create a hot mess. Instagram was getting easier to use but I still enjoyed Snapchat. Now I can’t handle the mess. It stresses me out to open the ugly, cluttered app. And it’s fine to blend stories and personal snaps, but it’s not exactly clear which is which and I’m so sick of tapping faces to view a snap but instead it starts a start a chat when I thought it was a story or visa versa. 
And it was good but no more. So how you can do that? To make a change that is bad. I just don't know. Furthermore, I cannot adhere heretofore against.
£££££££££££& no body care about your update now the instegram is good
This new update is butt I don’t get how too use none of it at all
you tried to update but its still terrible, thanks
I used to enjoy going on Snapchat but now I hate it. The update is garbage. It’s difficult to figure out. It’s like they tried to get so advanced with this update that only they could figure out because they devolved it. It reminds me of my old android I had, CRAP! If I had this update on my android I would have deleted the app and thrown the phone away with frustration. Snapchat before had a really good rating and good reviews. It would be behoove of Snapchat to go back to the original basic Snapchat. That’s what the users want. That’s the smart thing to do. I got rid of Snapchat completely because of this.
تحديث جداً سيئ للغاية
my friends & i legit deleted snap because of the update
The newest update on top of the previous bad one, still happens to be bad. Thanks Snapchat!
I’m deleting this due to I can’t figure out how to navigate now!! If it’s not broke then stop trying to fix it!!!!!!
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻😏👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏
FIX THIS UPDATE !!! Snapchat used to be my favorite app and now I barely use it cause I can’t find anyone’s stories and can barely find my own
I have spent eats on Snapchat and have always loved it. However, now it seems as though every time I open the app I get a little more frustrated and it gets a little less user friendly. Just this morning I logged out and logged back into Snapchat and the app is just now showing me snaps from weeks ago which it never even notified me about. Y’all say you made it more user friendly by pushing what we want to the top but whenever the snaps are out of order we don’t know where to find conversations we’re looking for because it’s so counterintuitive. I signed the petition to change back many of the features to the old Snapchat and what’s frustrating is y’all seemed to have absolutely zero concern with what we want, as users of the app, and just decided that because we didn’t like this update of the app, y’all were going to shove another new Snapchat down our throats. Not what we want at all. Listen to your customers because many of us are strongly considering quitting the app altogether.
Please Snapchat please stop screwing everything up don’t do any more stupid idiotic updates that are complete garbage. I am talking for all of those who hate your updates. It’s confusing it’s annoying just leave it the way it was.
It eats more battery than ever before, notifications don’t work half the time, the stories are completely screwed up and won’t show up for hours, and it crashes... I want the old Snapchat back.
First the terrible update, now to make it better you add swiping to get to groups? Literally can’t open up conversations normally anymore. The hell wants to hold down on a name to talk? Just digging your own grave. That 1 star rating sure does fit now
Who opens them anymore, this update is so inconvenient... and also how does the setting up for the incoming snaps go, bc I will get a snap and it will go to the bottom of my list! Not happy
I’ve probably opened Snapchat maybe 10 times since the update, mostly by habit and then I quickly close it when I remember the harsh reality of the new Snapchat.  A visually jarring, not user friendly, poorly organized nightmare. Not to mention that the update was pushed through without me updating it myself. I don’t use auto update.
It’s nice that you added the groups, stories, and all sections, but the ‘stories’ and ‘all’ should not be connected together!! There should be a section for just snapchats like there is one for stories. I hate having to go though and clear out all of the people who I don’t talk to because of their stories. And if you clear stories from the “all” section then they go away from the “stories” section. That shouldn’t be the case
I have had snap chat for years. I have not updated ny snap chat due to the new update so u was lucky. Please go back to it noone likes it. Look at your star rating. It went from a 4 start to when I looked at it a 1.8 star. You should take a hit.
This stupid app keeps crashing and the update is making me nauseous & IM SO MAD ABOUT IT THANKS
The new layout completely ruined sc. i hope u change it back before I delete the app..
This new update is even worse 😒😒
The new update is trash, making it a task to look at stories from my friends. When you make a change, you make it streamlined, easy to use, and give it a better appearance. Now you’ve just taken what makes your application great, user-friendliness and focus on the app-user, and smashed all of our aspects together to give 1/3 of the space to advertisements. You’ve sold out, and it has cost your stock over $1b so far. Take care of your customers first because without them, you just become an advertisement board. Shame on you.
I hate the new update. Change it back.
I like it, and I can adapt to the changes that have taken place 🙂
The newest incarnation of Snapchat is an absolute mess. Nothing is easy to find. If you want to ensure someone can find your story or ensure that someone gets an individual picture, I suggest sending an email. Why I still have this is anyone’s guess. In fact, I’ll probably move this to my “Useless” folder, which is always the last stop on my iPhone before I delete it. #MakeSnapchatGreatAgainByRestoringThePreviousVersion
WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY TO MAKE A LENSE 26.99 DOLLARS FOR A LENSE THATS RIDICULOUS 😭😭🤬😡🤬i was sooo exited to make my own lense but its a rip off and i shouldnt have to pay for a lense😭🤬😡And the new update is sooooo HORRIBLE WHEN I TELL U HORRIBLE ITS HORRIBLE AND ITS SOOOOO CONFUSING WHYY WOULD U MAKE ME PAY TO MAKE A NEW LENSE AND WHY DID U MAKE THE UPDATE SOO CONFUSING AND HORRIBLE
So are you guys changing this update or naw.... because no one is using your app anymore.
The app is great be I think you should add something new to it , make a Live on Snapchat so you can go live and a whole bunch a people can jump on say comments just like Instagram! 🤩
Everything is bunched together
I can’t text one of my friends, but it will let text other friends. The only way me and him can text is to use the camera. And every time I click on his name it kicks me off of Snapchat.
Aww
bring back the old snap we’re gonna find another app if you won’t
Very troubling frame of scope for 2018. I barely use the app now
Please bring back the old snapchat , this update is horrible we cannot love it or get used to it at all !
Snapchat was fun but this update without letting us know is horrible!!!
I hate this update it is HORRIBLE!!!! Please change it back! I use to be on Snapchat for at least 4-5 hours out of the day now it’s maybe 4-5 minutes! Smh
Crappie
I’m honestly not even gonna go on to list the plethora of newfound inconveniences tied in with the recent updates since you’ll probably run into them yourself. What was once a great app is now pretty much as good as trash.
رجعو الاول احسن لكم 😒
Worst update ever .. I’m considering moving completely to Instagram .. hard to use and confusing...
I not only speak for myself, but also the substantial number or reviewers who rated this app a one. It not only looks disgusting, but it is confusing to look at on top of that. Snapchat obviously heard the cries out for the was the app used to look and they still blatantly ignored a huge population of their users. I think the next course of action is to just throw the whole app away.
I have no use for Snapchat anymore!
So judging by the new update, Snapchat doesn’t seem to understand why people use their app? New design undermines or removes key functions and tries to push you to watch crap through their Discover screen . Please bring old design back.
Hi. I'm not a person to write reviews about anything but this new Snapchat , it's annoying and confusing. Please bring back it's previous version. Me and many other users will appreciate it.  Thank you. 
this app is a politically correct assault on the morally right human values that have always existed. why do we wonder why the millennial generation is so warped in how they think? we shouldn't, because a large piece of that problem comes from the pc driven propaganda of this app.
You know that everyone dislikes your new design and features but you don’t go back to the good easy design everyone enjoyed and loved. It was simple and easy to use and the main reason why it’s so great...but now I have to go through all my friends just to find one all the way at the bottom that I talk to frequently.... the discover portion is a huge cluster of people that I don’t even know or like story’s.... why Snapchat....why
Bad
I liked the old way of viewing stories. Why fix something that isn’t broken? Like others have said, it feels cluttered.
before the 2018 update of snapchat, it was BY FAR my favorite app. I used it every single day and it was the main way that i used to stay in contact with friends and family and how i kept up with their day to day lives. watching my friends stories is what i am most upset about. before the update they were always displayed in chronological order starting with whoever posted the most recent story. now it seems they come in no order at all and i even miss A LOT of people’s stories because they don’t appear to me at all unless i specifically search for their name. I HATE THIS. i am missing out in seeing so much. it makes me sad to say that i am not considering deleting the app because it has become useless to me and only makes me upset that i miss out on so much now.
I didn’t update to the  new crabby update after seeing everyone is complaining about it and i wake up this morning to find it updated by itself even though i disabled auto updates!! This is unprofessional snapchat. You can’t  enforce this if ppl hate it.. I will go back to instagram at least easier to use!
Please go back to the old storyline. This update is the worse.
Bring back the old version, you know everyone is asking for it. Why ruin a good thing? 🙄
I have been notified in this update that it is too failed to return the old better. I hope that the update will come back to the old and thank you
It’s hard to use and stupid. You have to scroll so far to find people. Please change back
I don’t dislike that you’re trying to separate things out again with “groups, stories, and all”, but I’d much rather have a section where all I’d my snaps are without the stories. So please add a tab for snaps only!
Bring back the old version!!! Bring back the old version!!! Bring back the old version!!! Bring back the old version!!! 
The new update is horrible.do not get Snapchat. The old Snapchat update was amazing. Snapchat what are u doing change Snapchat back. I do not recommend this app for anyone.unless they change the app back to it old update
Every update takes the fun out of this app. Too many Live events that  I've never cared about. Discovery is a waste.
I loved snap, but I’m praying they change it back to how it was. I use it way less now.
So much for the nudes and late night shenanigans. Snap rendered itself obsolete with its latest update.
Trash
the snapchat update is not something i look forward to. i personally and even with friends i’ve talked to or overheard. let’s go back to how it was recently. less complicated and easy to follow. now it’s complicated and no one actually cares about people’s stories so placing it next to where i actually communicate with others is awful.
Please just go back to the old layout!!!!!
old one old one old one
With the new update I never use Snapchat anymore... it used to be the only thing I used to keep in touch with friends but now we just resorted back to texting.. if something isn’t broken, don’t change it Snapchat!
Snapchat shows you people you dont follow and makes it extremely hard to see people you do follow. The update is terrible so dont even bother downloading the app.
The last update they did is the worst ,bring old snapshat back😅😭
The new update has definitely impacted the way I interact within the app. It is so complicated to keep up with stories of users that aren’t necessarily in your friends list, such as those with public accounts that allows you to view their stories. It gets lost among the rest of the other advertised accounts; news outlets, magazines, sporting, etc... with the addition of randomly showing other ‘popular’ stories and user accounts you wish not to view, nor have them clogging your discovery feed with these random and rather uninterested context.  Please we beg for an update and change! Return snapchat  to its native roots of easy-going, yet keeping it sleek and modern.   - xox 👻 
This New Updates Is Very Stupid I Wish You Guys Would Downgrade Back It Back To The Regular Way 🙄
we all want the old update back ‼️
Not bad but I miss the old one.. I will not use Snapchat any more .. thanks anyway
I hate this new update. Feels like I’m being forced to watch content I didn’t approve. Where the hell did all my follows story lines go? It’s a mess
Why Snapchat!!!! WHY??????? I was so faithful to you then you had to go and alienate me. This update has officially made you irrelevant, who has the time to flip threw your unorganized mess? Anyway I'm breaking up with you. Good luck finding another person who was as good to you as I was.
Snapchat old version was way better than this crappy updated version! Please bring back the old version!!!!
Stop trying to revolutionize it, it was good how it was. The new update wasn’t overwhelming it was just garbage to begin with. It went from all of my friends viewing my story to like 40 of them. And I don’t see half of the stories I want to until like hours later if I even see them at all. Your next update sounds like it’s going to be trash too. Just put it back and stop making your own app into garbage.
okay i get it and all that you guys HAVEN'T made any changes to the update buuut kylie jenner stop using it so will i you guys lost KYLIE JENNER smh
I really used to love snapchat, but now not anymore ,  I hate the update and the changes you made, it's really bad change
Snapchat use to be simple. Every update gets downloaded without my approval and is full of useless ads that I could care less about. It has turned into a ad friendly app instead of a user friendly app.
The new update is horrendous. I can’t find anything. The swiping to see stories and groups is so annoying. I miss the old Snapchat. This update is just horrible. No one likes it.
Bring back the old snappy :(
I thought y’all would’ve deleted that update so it can go back normally, but I hope y’all know some people starting to delete this app and some deactivating their account cause of this bs y’all thought was “ cool “😴 stuff sad bruh .
the update is trash
IF YOU ARE ON THE BOARD FOR SNAPCHATS EXECUTIVE DECISIONS, I HIGHLY SUGGEST FIRING EVAN AND TAKING BACK HIS $700m BONUS.  PROBABLY THE DUMBEST REDESIGN AND UPDATE THAT SNAPCHAT HAS EVER RELEASED. THE LAYOUT IS BEYOND GARBAGE. LOOK AT THE REVIEWS ITS OBVIOUS THAT WERE ALL UNHAPPY. 
Some of these updates are unnecessary and I don’t even use. Is it a way to turn off automatic updates? I think I’ll just delete the app.
WHYYYY.?  They continue to make Snapchat more irritating the more it updates. BY ITSELF. I should be able to choose whether I want the update or not. The 3 tabs thing is so useless. Before the update I would scroll halfway to see if I wanted to open it or not. Now I have no choice because if I try to do it, it goes to another TAB. THANKS FOR NOTHING SNAP. YOU CONTINUE TO MAKE YOUR USERS MAD. AND THEREFORE I WILL NOT BE USING IT ANYMORE
How can i take off the upgrade i hate it
The new feed in impractical. Go back.
The update feels forced on us. Snapchat has a exclusive and organic feel... promoting the fact that we (Snapchat) doesn’t need to be like all other apps in the sense of being more marketable by promoting big names on your discovery page. Snapchat felt like a home away from all the superficial social networks. Now it feels like all the other over cluttered apps marketing their agenda. Well we the people have no issue leaving this app and simply using Instagram feature of snap and live story or even facebooks feature. The one thing you had going for you is now lost due to your needs of financial gain.
CHANGE IT BACK SERIOUSLY!!! I'm done, I'm over it. If you guys don't change it back I'll have no choice but to delete it! For me and others honestly theirs no working with this. You guys have messed up. I have used Snapchat dramatically less lately. Snapchat used to be my number one social app. An app I had to get on 24/8. I go on twice a day now because of this update. Hope you guys come to your senses and realize that this is a mistake and the app is now a disaster. I'm moving to instagram now since Snapchat isn't Snapchat anymore.
reverse the update. please for the love of god
Please change the update that moved the story locations!! It is difficult to use and not convenient at all!!
Never have I felt this much frustration for an app update.
Quit making things worse. Put stories back on right, messages on left; ASAP.
Why you listen and go back to the old layout or at LEAST come out and say why you won’t
The new update is so so slow and I miss a lot of my friends’ snaps due to the new update  Other than that I cant even view any of my favorite social influencers and popular snapchaters  So please just bring the old version back as soon as possible!  Snapchat you’re so disappointed 
It doesn’t look right and doesn’t feel right. You’ve taken my love for it away (but I still use it) just please take inconsideration to change it back.   - Sincerely a fan of your company. 
Snapchat’s cool but bring the old format back or Im going to delete it
i do not like the new update bc i miss out on people’s stories and i do not enjoy seeing random people’s stories that i do not have added. i don’t like how the snapchats randomly pop up and then disappear again. long story short...the old one was muchhhhh better
GIVE US THE OLD UPDATE BACK , I KNOW YALL RECEIVING ALL THESE REVIEWS . IT’S DIFFICULT & WE DO NOOOOOOT LIKE IT . So Y’all Should Just Give Us The Regular Snapchat Back 🤷🏽‍♀️ Thanks ❤️
I got used the new update i love the idea of having friends on a page and celebrities or public accounts on the other i hope this stays the same. I also hope you could fix the other side (celebrity side)by not mixing people we follow with the ones we don’t.
The new update is pure trash, I’m so sick and tired of seen people I don’t know or follow. I be trying to dodge them by clicking “see less like this” but they keep coming out like roaches!!! 😭😩 I just want to see people that I know and people that I follow, I don’t care about anyone else, we should have the choice of subscribing to people we don’t know!! but obviously y’all took that right from us, this update is trash!!! Also..... I’m tired of clearing out my conversations, I don’t talk to everyone so why are people that I don’t talk to on my conversation list????? Y’all really think people are going to be subscribing to all these ads and people they don’t know nor care about.... you guys went from 100 to 0 real quick.
The update is stupid and if we wanted to follow certain people we would have. Now we a hard time seeing people we really want to see that aren’t following us back.
Snapchat is harder and more annoying as ever scene the new update the rating is only going to continue to go down if they don’t change the update back to the original. Plus every time I hit 100 streaks with someone Snapchat ends the streaks so I have to restart. 2/23/18 Ratings 1.8
This App used to be a great app! It functioned well and was great with keeping things in order. The new update is trash! Don't download!!! So Sad!!
If it aint broke don’t fix it. This app isn’t even usable now everything’s cluttered together and friends to mixed up. Just change it back
I will refuse to use this horrible new interface. Whoever designed this put Snapchat in the grave
I love Snapchat but the new update is in all means terrible, it’s hard to view stories and even view your own! I use to get many views but now I hardly get any because people are to lazy to go through all the chats and find your snap story! I’m leaving Snapchat aside until something is done, it’s fun to have updates just don’t mess up your app so bad that your ratings were at 5 star and now they are at 2! Thank you.
The new update ...  Haaaaatttteeeeeee iiiitttttt 
They should bring back my favorite filter the one with the two pink flowers . That’s My Favorite Filter It Makes Me Wanna Keep Using Snapchat ❤️‼️
You guys have destroyed snap...
This update is horrible and has definitely ruined Snapchat... if people don’t like it then you should obviously change it back.
Hey guess what, no one like the update and the star ratings are going down more and more. Change your product and things might go back to being good, even to an average 4 star rating 🤷‍♀️.
When I play a song and try too record it on Snapchat and post it on my story but there is no sound of song or anything. Please fix
I am disappointed I cannot find the list of mutual friends. I deleted all conversations, maybe it’s my bad—but at least Snapchat should be merciful to those who are naive with the app (like me). Also, I know the founder wants to separate the media/influencers from the friends... but we can do that ourselves, no need for the app founder to control our content for us. We have each our own way of consuming the data. This app is 1.8 stars for a reason— listen to your costumers.
When I thought they couldn’t make it worse they go ahead and do it. The only reason this isn’t a 0 Star is because that’s not an option.
Used to be a fun app til the past few updates.
To be completely and utterly honest, this is the worse possible update. No one can find their friends’ stories, as well as I keep recovering stories from celebrities and people I’m. It subscribed/friends with on the app. Speaking on behalf of everyone, NO ONE likes the update. It’s confusing and messy. There is nothing organized and well put together. It looks like a child took a puzzle and mixed up all the pieces and that’s what we get from the app....
Take me back to the old Snapchat please
I don’t think I’m the only one who will agree that this new update was really bad. There are a select few that are accepting the change, and having no issues with it whatsoever. But for the rest of us, including me, all the bugs that I’ve had prior are now even worse than before. I used to love this app. Of course it’s still one of my most used apps. Currently use it to keep in touch with a long distance relationship. It’s rather hard to do that when the app doesn’t always work. It crashes, the camera lags to the point that you have to restart the app to get it working again. And nowadays the app murders my battery even if I’m only using it lightly. That could be more a problem on Apple’s end and the age of my current device. But considering all of these problems, why did you create a new update like this? There were plenty of bugs and glitches you could’ve fixed, so instead you made bigger problems.
i will like snapchat to be removed off apple store. Thank you.
They need to listen to the users and change it back to the old format where it was EASIER to find stories and find your streak and just EVERYTHING. I’m starting to use Instagram for stories and even sending pictures to people because it is so terrible. You’ve lost over 300 million active users. (400 mill. To 100 mill) you get the hint yet? Fix it ASAP
can you at least make everything chronological? and instead of separating group chats from stories, merge the group chats and regular chats and separate the stories? thx
it’s been a few weeks since snapchat updated by itself and to put this bluntly, it’s terrible. i still haven’t gotten used to it. it’s cluttered and jumbled and downright confusing to use.  streaks are a hassle to open. when i try to open snaps, the order randomly shifts and i end up clicking on someone who i’ve already opened (if that makes sense). i absolutely despise the discover tab. i used to like viewing some of them, but now it’s just annoying to use. and don’t get me started on the recommended stories. i also don’t understand why the people we most recently talked to are sometimes moved down to a random place on our list. i have never seen a messaging app that does that; it just makes absolutely no sense. and the stories. i like watching my friends’ stories. but now it’s just so confusing to view. especially the fact that once you view someone’s story, that indication is gone and you basically forget that they had a story in the first place, unlike the previous update where you could easily access a person’s story. and i had no idea what i was doing the first time i uploaded a story under this update. i was genuinely confused as to where i could see my own story. the only thing i liked about this update was the bitmojis. but that isn’t enough to make up for this disaster of an app.  i’ve used snapchat for years. but until we get a less confusing and more organized layout, i doubt i’ll be using it much. 
I cannot stand the new update.  You guys ruined Snapchat. 😭
i don’t understand how 750k 1/5 star reviews hasn’t gotten the snapchat update reversed. the latest update hasn’t even change anything it’s still confusing and i don’t even wanna open the app anymore like it’s pointless. the chronological time is messed up so i don’t even see some messages til days after. i just miss the old snapchat i hate the new one
I enjoyed Snapchat a lot, but after the new update, it’s become very difficult to watch specific stories like I used to, as much as I love popular stories, I have the news and Facebook for that. My chat and friend story page looks like complete crap because it goes out of order depending on when you sent/ received a snap, and when your friend posted on their story, making it almost impossible to have all your recents at the top. Although it looks more ‘clean’, it definitely will NOT be something I can and would like to get used to. I’ve sadly made the decision to find another route of social media. 
This update is crap. You say you care about us interacting with our FRIENDS. Yet you make it impossible to find all our friends stories. You use this weird algorithm thinking that you KNOW who we want to see and who’s message we want to see first. Instead of keeping it simple. You have made a mess. You make a page all dedicated to advertisement/companies/celebrities. You claim “they are not our friends”. I think we all, for the most part, know they are not our friends. But most of us liked seeing these people in a way we can find them. Simply put, this app is a mess. I went from using this daily to using it to only a few times a week. Everything was great in the old version. Messages in order and on their own page. Stories in order on their own page. Also, finding friends on your friend list is even more difficult. They are out of order and don’t show everyone. This whole bitmoji thing is stupid too. I think it’s cool to send to friends but to force everyone’s profile picture to be a cartoon. I mean come on. I’m all set with using this. Bring something with better order and I might come back.
I like the new update. Keeps the clutter out and makes the content I like, my friends’ stories, separate from the stuff I’m not as interested in. I’m sure Snap has done their homework and knows their design will be successful over the long term. Innovation does not come without risk and scrutiny.
The newest update with groups/stories/all is soooooo close.  But so far away.   All I suggesting is going back to having snaps/streaks and stories separate.  Please and thank you
I hate to give Snapchat the lowest rating but please change it back I don’t get the new update and not interested in getting to figure it out . Thank you for your understanding .
Please bring back the old format. It was so much better than this new one we have
Please bring back the old snap!
Snap is a publicly traded company, how can you guys think this design update was a good idea? Friends with snap streaks in the hundreds have simply abandoned the app for Instagram. There’s a million competing services to you and social networks that once seemed invincible like MySpace and Digg and Vine all simply evaporated.
This update is a no no. I don’t see people’s stories anymore ☹️😕. And the fact that you didn’t ever consider going back to the old style shows how very little you care about your customers 😕. Disappointing.
Crap
If i add someone first, it acts like they never added me back. when i know they did. it won’t let me slide up on their story or it won’t say their snap score. it takes weeks for it to act like they did add me back. This has been a problem since before the new update. Like a month ago.
Ever since I updated my Snapchat, The update won’t let me see my old messages from a year ago! What the hell is going on Snapchat, I used to love this app. But now I really don’t know what to say anymore, I might as well delete this app. Very disappointed :(
Please put Snapchat back to the way it was before these most recent updates. It is so confusing trying to navigate it. I try to delete conversations and then I watch a story and they reappear. And the order of conversations is always so jumbled. I also dislike how the stories are on the same side as the conversations. I do not really look at the Buzzfeed or Tastemade and such stuff anymore because it’s hard to find and annoying. The random famous people mixed in is frustrating too. The only thing I like about the newest update is that you have to tap to see a persons story instead of it playing automatically. I prefer tapping to see it because then you are not accidentally watching stories you did not mean to look at. So aside from this, please, please put everything back to how it was. It was very nice and fun and easy to use before. It was one of my most used apps, but now I’m considering deleting Snapchat. Hardly any of my friends are using it anymore, and the ones that do use it less now because of the update.
Bring back the old Snapchat 😡
Change it back. You've ruined Snapchat, and in the process, have managed to turn all of your Snapchat users against you. People are freaking signed petitions to get Snapchat back to the old version. Why can't you people take the hint? No one likes this stupid update, and no matter how much money you're making, this basically could end Snapchat. Please I'm begging you to change it back. KEEP YOUR USERS SIMPLE AND HAPPY, NOT CONFUSED AND ANGRY. GOOD LORD.
This new update is so bad. I miss the old version it was much simpler and easy but now the new one I don’t know how to use it and it’s really complicated . I hope they go back to the old version
The new update is a real disappointment. I prefer the old version. Why did you have to change it? Big mistake.
This update is horrible. It is super confusing having stories and chats out together on one page. It’s not even clear when a friend’s recently posted a new story. It’s terrible and I have been using Instagram story more. Snapchat you need to go back to how it was before you lose your users to Instagram
Can u fix it where u know if the other person is typing or not bc it’s really confusing .it will help a lot thanks
IM COMING BACK EVERY UPDATE TO RATE ONE STAR UNTIL SNAPCHAT IS FIXED. GOD BLESS
Worst update. Snap was my favorite app, I used it the most. Now it's usable, my friends and i decided to switch to instagram to chat and send pics. Updates that need to be made:  Please separate the chat from the stories. I see people prioritized because they post a story that I never talk to and people who actually snap me are lower on the list. Font is so small. And on the public feed side, I hate that I get random irrelevant celebrities. Such a useless update, no thought was put into the customer/ user perspective. Please conduct usability testing next time you release a feature. Thanks! 
I hate the new update !
If I could give it ZERO stars I would
This update is horrible!!!!!
👎👎👎👎👎👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻
I loved this app but now I couldn’t find my snap story with two hands, this is trash and they need to simplify it, I hate this new system
Everyone hates the new update, fix it.
I am so sorry but the reason y’all are getting one star ratings is because of this update. I don’t know what y’all were thinkin but it ain’t cute :( and you know that. You know everybody thinks that. Snapchat was absolutely fine before this. Do us a favor and change it back ? Lol yikes this ain’t lookin hot for y’all.
I dont like the update. Its not good 😭
Everything is crowded and I lost a lot of streaks :\
The update is garbage. The CEO doubling down and saying people will become accustomed to it. Just bite bullet and admit you were wrong and change it back.
I hate this new update I hope you guys can put the old Snapchat thing cuz I hate it now y’all don’t understand 😤 it’s the worse thing ever
Everyone go read how the CEO of snapchat said that the update is here to stay and we should “just get used to this”. Disgusting. It’s like snapchat doesn’t even care about its users and is focusing more on money and advertisements. It’s not flattering that other apps are copying Snapchat’s features, it’s them giving us what users WANT. Pretty soon snapchat will be irrelevant.
This is the worst app. It used to be my favorite but now it’s at the bottom. I only have it to keep up my streaks, but now I don’t even want to do that. Now I can’t slide peek on conversations.
Snapchat was my favorite app until it came up with this BS update just to get more money from advertisers. Surely there’s another way to format the app where it’s actually ORGANIZED. Don’t update if you haven’t yet and if not it’s only a matter of time before it updates itself. I will be using Instagram stories from now on until snap comes up with something better
At first it was great but this new update had to go I dint even know how to watch stories anymore
I hate it , its so baaaaaaad
Garbage.
This update is the worst. Having people pay Snapchat to feature their "stories". Yeah no thanks, I'd rather just message them. Deleting this waste of an app.
This update was not a good idea I’m deleting snap chat
The new update is literally trash. Please fix it
So today (feb. 23 2018) snap decided to upgrade, again. I already wrote a review when the new update came regarding all of its flaws but this new one is a flat out no. Mine didnt update like some others did, but i got some lovely bugs and issues along with it. My phone keeps crashing the app. Some of the photos open upside down, some of the photos dont open. I cant open some peoples snaps, convo or picts. When said photos flip upside down when my snaps do open, the app crashes. I'm going to be deleting snapchat and their ceo needs to get it together. Non of my friends use it anymore because of how anti user friendly.
This update was really so unnecessary and such a reach for something new that it messed up the ability to enjoy the app. Everything is out of order.
New update is trash.
The arrogance of the CEO saying how we will get use to the new format is as annoying as the crappy new updates format. Ruined a good fun app with overthinking once again. Thanks for ruining it.
It's new update is confusing but some things happen for a reason but I don't like the new update for snapchat➕➖
I use to Love Snapchat. No longer love Snapchat because of this new find story update . Bring back the old home page
Can you take the recent update away from my Snapchat. It’s not working right.
tienen que cambiar el update nuevo , ya que casi nadie usa snapchat por eso , es muy malo la nueva actualización
The whole ui is 💩 also there's no filters for me LoL 😂 hope i could give 0 star because this app doesn't deserve even a 1 star...
if remy ma was an update, this would be it.
I used to love this app and it used to take up at least 65% of my battery life but as soon as the update was released I was incredibly disappointed. The storys ,chats,streaks, and more are way harder to navigate and use.It is so bad that at this point im considering abandoning this app completely. Overall I am extremely sad and disappointed if there was no stars thats what I would give this app at this point. The update is probably based around trying to show you more ads so that they can get more money as if it wasn’t already a multi million let alone billion dollar company. Not to mention that they added the “snap store” which is basically snapchats answer to YouTuber merch (extremely overpriced most of the time, mostly useless and just overall junk most times). I cannot begin to put into words how insanely frustrated, disappointed , and angry I am with snapchat and its new update. Overall........0 stars
Selling my stock in Snapchat and deleting the app , can’t hold a promise of  changing it back shows your not a trust worthy company nor do you care what your fans and users think !
Is trash
Get with the program Snapchat give the people what they want!
They are pushing heavy forwards advertising which takes away from the social part of the app. Wouldn’t recommend downloading it until they change it
Seriously i get notifications of snapchat and when i enter the app because they are mixed up with the stories people post and sometimes just random order i cannot find the person who snapped me, why dont put it in a regular order
I love how new things got added on to the app like the gifs, butttt... the new update is confusing because all of the people I have on Snapchat and the news or buzzfeed, the articles they are all mixed in with my friends and it takes a while to look for my friends snaps so hopefully soon you guys can in a way get the old Snapchat back where the friends were separate from the other snaps. Other than that I love the GIFs! And filters!:)
the update is trash. thanks for nothing snapchat. you’ve p.o.’d half of earths population. that takes skill
Not downloading until y’all give us back the old snapchat
it’s as bad as the time you guys tried making us pay for filters
New update is trash. Just go back.
Horrrrrrrible! EVERYONE I KNOW HATES IT! You ruined a great thing! Also, the news feed is awful for young people! All about sexual content and the freaking Kardashian’s! Sick of it. Make it more youth friendly PLEASE! Or at least allow us to sensor or block that garbage!
Snapchat is great. I’m on Snapchat 24/7 and use it to text friends more than messenger. It’s also a great way to catch up with your friends and seeing what’s new by watching their stories. However, I am rating Snapchat two stars because of the new update. This new update is terrible, and although they think we only need time to get use to it, I can say for certain I will forever miss the old format. Snapchat is no longer as social or as personal. It is so much harder to find a friends story or even someone you were just snapping. I think I speak for everybody when I say Snapchat really messed up with this update. If Snapchat does rollback this update I would forsure give this app 5 stars, but for now I am giving it 2.
I absolutely hate the new update! I never use it anymore! Sad!
You've heard our cries on ALL social media. What are you doing?!!! It's frustrating. I honestly check your ratings more than your app because that's more amazing to see.
The new update completely ruined Snapchat!
Never used such a buggy app since the latest update, it kicks me out the app every two seconds I'm on it and I have to delete the app and download it again to use it and the layout is completely terrible
The new update was worse than it was before. It’s simple, split messages and stories to keep your users happy. Y’all keep screwing up like this and instagram stories will take over. I don’t want that, you don’t want that.
Snapchat has gone to crap ever since this update and I absolutely hate it. The navigation is garbage, friend’s stories with the snapchats sent? no thanks, and the more popular snapchats are confusing to get through. The multiple word bubbles and gifs and stuff is cool, keep that, but put the stories and sent/received snapchats back how it was!
I miss the old snapchat when it was simple and I was able to see the stories of the people that I chose to see. I hate this new complicated update. This made everything worse. Might as well email me because snapchat is harder. Please snapchat, revert to your old layout.
I don’t like the new update go back to the regular one the new one is confusing and Runs Slow .
THIS NEW UPDATE IS TERRIBLE. I HATE USING SNAPCHAT NOW BECAUSE OF IT. IM GOING TO DOWNLOAD KIK AND USE KIK FROM NOW ON. U GOT KIK.
I use snapchat daily, but I really hate the stories and chats being on the same screen. I don't like having my chat screens cluttered and whenever I look at someone's story it stays on my chat screen and I hate it. I have a lot of friends and it gets very cluttered and drives me crazy.. Please go back to the way it was before!!
The update is so bad.
Snapchat was good till y’all wanna update it leave it as it was go back to the old Snapchat I will delete that app
Laughing at the fact Kylie Jenner doesn't even get on snap after the update 😂💀
I used to love Snapchat, but not anymore. It’s the worst, and the newest update is DUMB. If you don’t have it, you’re not missing out! I don’t understand stories anymore and what’s the point thing of keeping a streak when it’s barely noticeable on the page?! CHANGE IT BACK!!!!!!! Otherwise some new app will take your place as the “new fad.”
The new update is very bad 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Do better
I just want a name.  Like who sat in on this huge meeting presenting this ridiculous update "idea" and then 100 people agreed ...  Idiots. Ok when are you changing it back?? 
I’d give it a zero if possible, IT IS SO CONFUSING. I can’t even keep track of my streaks because random people are just popping up everywhere! PLEASE REVERSE THE UPDATE!! it’s just messy really. Unorganized. It was better the other way!! IF IT AINT BROKE, DONT FIX IT
Your customers want the old Snapchat. Just go back to the old design!!
I LOVE Snapchat... but this new update is a mess... I loved being able to see my friends stories and watch my favorite subscriptions... now my “news page” is littered with celebrities stories that I have no interest in and I can’t even find my subscriptions they get bumped down so low... and I have friends I’m not even close with that show up on my news feed page as if I’m subscribed to them... please Snapchat let us have the option to go back to the old way... I would hate to have to quit using it but at this point it’s not enjoyable just frustrating...
You guys should actually care about your users, but you don't. You know no one likes the update, so change it back. Stop caring about money and care about your users. The update looks like a 2 year old made it. Was it bring your child to work day when this update was made? Or are children actually making this pathetic excuse for an app. Thanks.
To the people responsible for this stupid unnecessary update, ya moms a hoe.
سيئ جدآ
used to love snapchat now i hate it the update is bad i dont like the whole format please fix it!🖕🏽😤 done with snapchat deleting it‼️
Snapchat what are you doing please stop and just go back to the old snap pleaseeee!
I don’t understand why a company like snapchat would lose so much investors and users because of an update that is outdated bring back the old snapchat
I've used Snapchat consistency the past years but now with this update I stopped using it almost completely. The update is confusing and makes me not wanna see other people's snap. I get confused on who's to choose when viewing a snap. Because the photo of their profile is now a pix of their current story Please change back to the old update 
Snapchat was my favorite app before this update I now can’t say the same. I hate that it’s not in time sequence when people post new stories , It’s too confusing and no one views your snaps because of how far down and hidden some snaps can be , the page all the way too the right has like the famous people I have on it but also random people’s Snapchats I never even added on my Snapchat therefore,  I don’t want too see random people there .
I accidentally updated my Snapchat and now it’s terrible. I used to LOVE Snapchat and I used it as my main form of social media. Loved how you could see your friends stories and every section was organized chronologically. Now it’s terrible. People I NEVER talk to are suddenly at the top of my friends feed and people I talk to constantly are getting shoved down to bottom of my feed and I have to spend time searching for their profiles to chat or see the snaps they send me privately. It’s TERRIBLE. Also who cares about having stories with private messages?! It’s like putting the news into your text messages. I’m not going to this specific page to see what everyone and their brothers cousins roommate is doing. I just want to see the messages that I’ve been sent. Separate stories and private messages again and MAYBE it’ll be less terrible. Also I don’t want to see random “popular” stories. If I cared about these random “celebrities” whose names I’ve literally never heard in my entire life then I’d be following them. Instead you’re getting other people’s content forced down your throat when you attempt to use the discover page. Snapchat has been COMPLETELY ruined. New filters and gifs and fonts won’t save how horribly organized the feeds are
What IDIOT decided to backslide the app? Seriously, this “update” is a total flop - I loved Snapchat. Key word: loved. Now, I don’t open it because you can’t find squat. Unless things change back, I’ll be deleting soon. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Make it so that I can record while linked to a Bluetooth device .. Had a party and it KEPT DISCONNECTING when I recorded.. Do better! Also the new update is trash Juice
I have always stayed loyal to Snapchat. Bought spectacles before public release. I support anything Snapchat. I am asking you to please fix this stupid new format. It is terrible and does not make this platform easy or fun to use anymore.
I’ve been using Snapchat for years now, and I love it. However, there used to be a feature that allowed a user to leave a private story. I have just noticed that this feature is no longer available, which is very inconvenient when friends have put me in stories that they never stop posting on. Please add this feature back, it was helpful and good!
Please Separate stories from text. this update is absolutely garbage. Everything feels congested and crammed together. Please reverse this trash update
Title says it all
Snap update is still dumb as hell. Ur rates are dropping faster than the stock market crash back in 1929.
Trash. Old platform is way better. Too many glitches on this one nd my views went down tf.
Reverse the update that ruined the app no one likes it. Your taking something perfect and throwing it in the trash, listen to the people and you’ll get much better ratings. Instagram will ruin you guys if you don’t fix your app. Reverse it ASAP!!!!!!!!
Was not a fan of Instagram or any other social media! Snapchat was my favorite of all, this new update is the worst! I do not like the separation of your friends or who You follow. I don’t care of all the new celebrities or makeup gurus Snapchat suggest for me to follow. If I liked them I would’ve already had followed them. I will definitely be deleting this app for good if it does not change back anytime soon. 
My life was going great until my Snapchat was updated automatically. I would update my story, talk to my friends, send some casual streaks, until my life changed for the worse. The update. I can’t even wrap my head around what the people who made this update happen we’re thinking. My life feels incomplete with this update. Only 80 people see my cute af selfies on my story now and none of them are even hot. Very displeased.
Look, I understand those that work at snapchat thought this new update would be great and that users would really like it. But the simple fact is that most users would prefer that the app had kept the previous layout and kept incoming snaps and stories separated from each other, the newest update helps you view stories and group chats separately now which is very helpful. BUT, it does not fix the problem of the page that shows all the incoming snaps feeling very cluttered and disorganized because it still shows the stories along with incoming snaps. This new design seemed good on paper and possibly even in testing but if the majority of the users hate the new update then it’s time to go back to the way things were. I’ve watched this app’s ratings go from nearly #1 in the App Store with five stars to less than two stars in the course of about two weeks, if that does not tell you that users hate the update than I don’t know what will. GO BACK TO THE OLD VERSION the people have told you what they want and it’s time to listen to them.
there was literally no reason to change the layout, everyone loved snapchat at my school. as soon as the update came out there wasn’t a single one of my friends that liked it. the only good thing is the bitmoji realism, but i’d trade that to get the old snapchat back.
Look I love using this it’s using snapchat but I hate the update y’all need to get this y’all sh*t together
Honestly if I didn’t have such high streaks, I probably wouldn’t use Snapchat anymore. The update has made it so confusing. I used to get lots of views on my story and now I get like half. It’s not easily accessible. I don’t know where have the crap is. Half the time it doesn’t work. I loved the old style of snapchat I wish, along with a lot of other people, that they would just go back to the old snapchat.
Dead on arrival.
I love Snapchat and will probably never stop using it, but the new update is simply annoying. The developers should have never changed the format to what it is now. One sorta upside is the “all, stories, group” options which is kinda nice in a way, but I feel like everyone can agree that it looks a little lazy that they didn’t put in a chat option. That’s the biggest problem with the update is that it combines the stories with the chats and it’s simply annoying cause personally, when I’m snapping someone I’m not simultaneously looking at stories. Yes I do like stories and I look at other people’s almost every day, but it’s nice to have them separated. I feel like that’s very agreeable upon. If the developers put in a chat option when you swipe to the left area of Snapchat it’ll make it a lot better because that’s really what almost everyone has a problem with. And also the streak and best friend emoji placement could be better but that’s a minuscule problem compared to the chatting thing I already mentioned. But for now, just put in a chatting option when you swipe left and leave off with that. Or just go back to how it was before the update and all the complaining will stop cause everyone knows that’s how it started.
What the H E double hockey sticks have you done Snapchat??
So...I love snapchat don’t get me wrong but this new update is the worst thing you could’ve done...it’s like you guys are trying to fail snapchat. And did you not see that you have SOOO many complaints about the new update? And do you NOT see that you have TWO stars??? I understand that you are trying to trick people into reading more articles, but it’s not cool and you are getting ALOT of hate. Please just THINK about what you have done and please just stop being selfish and think about what your fans want. GO BACK AND LOOK AT WHAT DAMAGE YOU HAVE CAUSED YOURSELVES!!!!!
Snapchat was my go to app and now I hardly ever go on it ! So disappointed that snapchat is not listening to everyone’s opinion! Just hate it and it’s so confusing and frustrating ugh ! But I guess now Instagram will be my go to app.!!
At this point just waiting for a developer to make the next best thing. The functionality of this update is ridiculously stupid.
Ok the update isn’t that bad you guys..
It has gone down hill bc of the stupid update!
please
I’m not sure who let this complete garbage roll out of the Snapchat building but it blows my mind that a company worth so much with the ability to hire talented creators , would create something so disastrous. I’ve seen 8 year old kids do better designing in Microsoft paint .   Give us the old update back , or face the future of being a dead app. Everyone hates it , you messed up, quit arguing , and being the old software back . 
SEPERATE MESSAGING PAGE FROM STORIES
Reverse the update.
I truly hope Snapchat listens to its users and does something about this jumbled mess of an update/new layout. Snaps are hard to locate, not in order, impossible to find friends because it’s not even in any alphabetical order, etc. please revert.
Changed the Format so much to where no one likes it. People hate this app. It went from a 4 out of a 5 to a 1 out of 5 in a few weeks. Don’t you think, Snapchat, that you did something wrong how you are losing people and losing ratings and losing customers??? Maybe do something about that to where everyone can enjoy it instead of get rid of it and uninstall. Maybe change to the old format and update some small features like bitmojis and maps and discover. Friendly Advice
It’s even worse now I can’t even a take picture without it exits the app u gotta do better than this
The new update is terrible confusing and not easy to use Snapchat please have the new update took an away it would be very helpful
Snapchat doesn’t care about its users
I still like Snapchat but I just really miss the old version. The new update is very cluttered and focuses way too much on celebrity snaps and subscribed stories. I really don’t care about them...if I did I would’ve looked at them on the old snap. It basically forces you to look at peoples stories bc it moves them to the top of your chat list. It’s irritating. I’ll continue to use the app I just really don’t like it much anymore.
snapchat is so pathetic that the app literally wont work anymore. good job team snapchat.
I love snap chat, I use it everyday multiple times a day. However, these last two updates were the absolute worst things to happen to it. It’s awful now. I hate it. Not user friendly. I truthfully doubt there are any people that honestly understand how it works now. You made something great and then completely ruined it. For the love of god please change it.
HORRIBLE NEW UPDATE!!!!!!! Don’t mix the stories with conversations. DUMB!!!!!
Honestly when something gets success everyone wants to make it better and they think their ideas are good but it just ruins that once great idea. Snapchat stayed relatively the same for years then a huge update moved everything made it confusing combines stories and the “feed list” of ppl you message. Now they have this weird swipe to stories or groups when that used to be swipe to chat so now you have to hold on their icon “if you can even find it” to chat. Fix it soon or we will all look for a new app I’m sure it’s being developed right now
Snapchat really messed up on this upstage again! It’s not worth using anymore
Wow why can’t you just put it back?
This new update is less user friendly and an overall decrease in quality UI. Whoever designed this is not only clueless to what users want, but also overconfident in their abilities to create an efficient UI.
So the new Snapchat update is ugly af. A lot of people stopped using sc now because of it.we need the old one back ASAP. My Snapchat updated by itself or else I would’ve NEVER updated. We should be able to choose what version we want cause the new ones trash.    UPDATE : okay so I saw that there was another update and I was like no way it could get worse then what it already is and nope I was wrong I’m going to kill myself this app is trash now it’s so disappointing. 
The Snapchat update is complete trash.
Overall, the update is not got in my opinion. The old way of seeing everyone’s story in one area seemed simpler to me, and that is the biggest issue. I’d prefer not to swipe back and forth to go through my friends stories and to see my favorite celebrities stories. Also, on the side with the celebrity/verified stories, it’s way too cluttered. I need to scroll through to find the people I actually follow. In addition, custom stories with friends are ruined. This is due to the inability to find them since it’s all in between the random verified stories. I had a custom story with my entire grade on Snapchat. That thing was alive and well. Everyone posted in response to the person before, and we all had a great time. But now, that story is dead. No one can find it to respond to one another. Honestly, a simple revert back to the good old Snapchat with one side for Snaps and one side for stories would be a lot better since a huge sum of your users are used to it. I can’t think of many pros, but there are a couple. I think you guys sorted it so that more relevant people that I talk to stay at the top (not sure.) Other than that, I’m very unhappy with the update.  pls revert to the old snapchat. 
I have loved snapchat but this new version is horrible. Considering deleting it because of this version go back to the old one please
New update is terrible and must be changed ASAP, confusing and hard to use and should be changed ASAP
This Update was not done well. The pages are too cluttered. I tried to get use to it but i just don’t like it. And i use to love Snap.
Seriously Snapchat please please please I don’t even wanna open your app know I used it so much and so often now that I deleted it because of the latest update I feel like I’ve lost so much but seriously don’t update its no disgrace to look at it’s so bad Snapchat please fix it
Snapchat’s new “update” is a real piece of work. My phone freezes ALLLLLLL THE TIME now and it’s so freaking unorganized compared to later versions. Bring the old version back!!!
I’m very disappointed with the new update. 👎🏽🗑
bring the old update back dang! please and thank you!!!
BRING BACK THE OLD STYLE!!!!!!!!! The new Snapchat is a complete disaster. This is the worst update in the history of social media. 
This new update is completely horrible. Everything is all cluttered. It is just....  completely horrible.
First of all, why? Who decided there needed to be a change in the first place. Your users were happy with the Snapchat they had and loved ever so dearly. There was no need for a change. If anything the change made the app harder and more frustration to use. I’ve stopped using the app because of this ridiculously frustration update. The old version was easier to use, more aesthetically pleasing, and satisfied users. I’m mad, I’m upset, I don’t understand what compelled your company to do this. If you don’t change it back I might just stop using the app completely. Also your stock prices have dropped. Coincidence? I think not.
I’ve been a user ever since 2012 or 2011. This update was the worst ever. Simply because you took away whoever posts their story recently pops up first and alphabetically ordered friends stories. Also is very cluttered. You guys need to fix this to up the ratings.
I have been using Snapchat for over 2 years now and I like the original layout it had where my friends stories were
Garbage
Ok so the new update of Snapchat is so weird that you really can’t tell who’s story your watching and some technical glitches.
I’m only complaining about the new update specifically the format of snapchats and snap stories being combined. I personally don’t like it and have had every single of my friends complain to me about it. So hopefully admin will make some changes and I’ll have something good to say about this app
The update is just terrible. Snapchat isn’t fun anymore.
WHY IS EVERY NEW UPDATE WORSE AND WORSE
Go back to old snapchat 2017 . Listen to us its been enough time, you should have enough feedback
Latest update is complete garbage.  Who is the moron thought this was a good idea? It’s now so confusing to use now.
With all these updates Snapchat is updating their app to pure garbage. Go back to the old version where everyone knew how to use Snapchat. It’s what everyone wants so why keep it? #snapsucksass2k18
DO NOT,I repeat DO NOT change the update back to the old one  The new update is better nobody likes the old one anymore 
Snapchat has a new update which completely messed everything up. I have my auto update turned off so I’ve never gotten an update unless I manually updated the app. Because they knew EVERYONE hated the app and was going to avoid updating, they force updated all the people's apps for them. And they refuse to go back to the old version even though literally everyone hates the new one. All my views have been cut in half and it’s hard to find people’s stories because everything shows up so randomly. I hate it
Everybody hates the new update. Everyone knows it, including Snapchat themselves. It doesn’t even make sense. I definitely do not open Snap as much as I used to.
New interface isn’t user friendly. Hard to see who has a story, who viewed my story. Hard to read streaks and other friend emojis. Keep accidentally opening text feature instead of viewing stories or sending a snap. Just a very inconsiderate move on Snapchat’s part. I don’t even visit the “stories” tab anymore and I’ve pretty much given up on watching my friends stories but it doesn’t matter because they’ve pretty much stopped posting.
The update is trash 👎🏽🚮.  It was fine before the new update. 🚮😭
I used to love the app, but they ruined it with the new layout. No thanks. Uninstalled.
I hate the update , I never use it now
Wow I was starting to get used to the new update and getting a bit used to it, and I thought that update was bad. This update is even worse . I’m done using this app. Uninstalling.
I love this platform and applaud you for surviving a buy out from Facebook but this new update is doing u harm. I’m don’t
I love Snapchat but hate this new update. It is so confusing and I don’t care to watch other channels updates.
So snapchat you see your ratings dropping your losing money yet you still keep this update why? It’s the source to all your problems fix it please
Down to using Snapchat to 3x a day and ready to delete. 3 updates later and same new set up that everyone is complaining about. It’s my only form of “social media” that I have . But idc.... its a messy setup i can delete tomorrow
I am EXTREMELY disappointed that snapchat has made this update. Nobody likes it. Their ratings have went down and lots of people refuse to use the app anymore. If something is doing good don’t change the entire format. That’s just stupid. I want the old version back
I really don’t like it when I talk to someone then I can’t see the chat anymore. It’s dumb & Pointless.
The new update with the fonts will not work on my phone. I’ve updated it twice and nothing happened.
This update is complete TRASH. And you’ve heard all the negative feedback and yet nothing has changed. Worst update on the history of updates. I hope the CEO goes bankrupt.
I use Snapchat a lot, but when it comes to the new update I hate it it feels like way to much. I look at other people’s stories a lot now with it being on the chat side it’s hard to tap.
Bad
The new update makes me feel the same way flaming dog poop smells. If trash was a app this would be it. Snapchat is now the Donald Trump of apps.oud obnoxious and I hate it.
separate the stories and the snaps again this update is terrible.
This new update has totally killed the app. Either they need to fix it or just give up. It is totally usable in the state that it’s in.
I used to use snap all the time but ever since the update I haven’t? Overall the update made the app child like for probably a five year old with the bitmoji being your “person “ persa now in all honestly I just have snap because I cannot save all my memories on my camera roll. Therefore it is the only reason I still have the app if not it would have been deleted after the update came along.
Snapchat is just not the same anymore. I still use it to communicate with my friends but I could just use another app for that. Ever since this update I've been wanting to just delete Snapchat forever and start using kik again. That's sad. Please get rid of this new update it's really depressing thanks
Ok so I’ve had the update for a wile and it’s weird and I personally do not like it I would much rather have the old layout and this layout in general is a good idea just not executed very well there’s a few weird things witch is why I personally like the old layout better witch is why we soukd bring it back
The new update is unorganized and complex to use. As you can see the rate for the app is 1.8/5 just change it back already. It was fine the way it was.
I know I can say this for everyone but we prefer the old snapchat and even celebrities hate this new Snapchat, so I you can please bring it back everyone will be happy if not then a lot of people will leave Snapchat.....
I Would Like To Have A Whole Collection Of The Filters To Choose From Because You Guys Keep Deleting Them . Can We Please Have A List Of Filters To Choose From & Which Ever Ones We Like They'll Appear On Our Snap & Only Our Snap Filters ? Thank You 🤗‼️& Please Let Us Change Our Usernames
i love snapchat but it's now depressing and cluttered and i know i'm a lazy american but this is stupid and confusing
👎🏼.
Snapchat is my favorite app, but I really dislike this new update. I don’t like the changes that were made to the layout of everything. The previous version, unlike this new update, was simple, easy to use, and enjoyable.
Forever
This is probably the worst update of any update of anything I have ever had to update. Put it back so it makes sense. Who thought this was a good idea?
I have the new Snapchat update but the only thing i don’t have is the new fonts that come with it!!😭
It blows now, every update they make things more complicated with stupid features. I also don't enjoy the holiday snaps from the team.
Fix it.
Snapchat was a really good app and then the dumb update that they thought was going to improve Snapchat made it horrible and they should just put it back like it used to be.
First you updated it to where everyone hated it and the chat page was all cluttered and just as I was getting used to that update y’all updated it AGAIN and now I can’t slide over to see what someone says and it’s really annoying cause I don’t open all my Snapchats and now I have to watch all the snaps someone sent me to be able to see the chat I can’t just slide over cause when I slide over it goes the the stories page and the groups page. THIS UPDATE IS GOING TO MAKE ME DELETE SNAPCHAT. I don’t understand why snapchat isn’t listening to anyone about hating this update I’ve only heard one person say they like it.
Just never the same anymore, I don’t think the app improved I think it got worst. Sc just stick to what has worked before, stop being so extra
Smh
THE NEW UPDATE IS TARRIBLE PLEASE REVERSE IT SNAP CHAT PLEASE!!
I HATE SNAPCHAT NOW MAN I FEEL LIKE A GRANDMA NOW BC I DONT KNOW WHAT IM DOING
Finally they added a section for stories
Please get rid of it or I'll resort to deleting it and just messaging on Kik I don't want to lose all my streaks but your not giving me much of a choose here
Please change Snapchat back it’s hard to use now thank you
Please make the world better by bringing the old snapchat back,“Make snapchat great again”.
I’ve had Snapchat SINCE THE BEGINNING. I’ve got to admit. The original Snapchat even before the filters was awesome and easy to use. Then they added filters, okay cool. Then stories. Then snapcash. The folks at Snapchat continue to add and build and change something that was perfect the way it was prior.  What kills a company? Trying to fix your product when it’s not broken. In the 85 years LEGO has been in business. Have they once altered their product to the point it’s almost something completely different? Absolutely not because those little blocks work and always will. They’ve created new blocks and new products but they’ve never changed their original product.   Unfortunately for Snapchat, I believe they’ve built on top of their original block way to much, way to tall, and way to wide. Sadly, it’s starting to crumble. Miraculously Snaps stock prices have actually gone up since the update but I predict that here soon they’ll fall back down. Especially with all of the negative talk about it on social media.   Snapchat should investigate the current hashtags and see just what people think about the new update. Conduct a poll within their app and in a story. Make the results public and do what’s needed to move forward from this disastrous update. 
Wow u keep making everything more complicated
I’m fight y’all for real what is wrong with y’all? If y’all don’t go back to the old update
I use to like it a lot but now I think I hate it ... the new layout is just difficult to manage it’s not as user friendly as before ... idk but now everything takes long to load could be my internet ( although all along it was fine) but what really irritates me is that you even have to load your own story.. idk if I am even explaining it correct .. it’s just confusing .. can’t even explain the problem s ..  I frustrates me
I was soo happy that for some reason I did not have the update like everyone else but today out of no where I go to my snapchat and I saw this mess. Please snapchat change it back! I use this app everyday to communicate with my friends as well as snap pics. This new version is not fun to use! 😪
Snapchat started as a great app, through various updates it has gotten more and more difficult for users to navigate. Snapchat has refused to listen to the complaints of its users and has chosen not to provide them with what the user wants. The company is stubborn and believes everything they do will be best for everyone, even if the backlash is so drastic after every update. The apps star rating speaks for itself. I deleted a long time ago, and will not be returning. I hope snapchat comes around.
Fix sc to the way it used to be Oml this update was horrible and then you keep making them go from bad to absolutely horrible
I don’t like the new updates I want the old Snapchat back where you go to the 3rd page and can look at peoples stories over again
GIVE US THE OLD UPDATE BACK PLZ!!!!
Stop making Snapchat more gay. You’ll lose the fan base like Facebook
Terrible update. Used to be a fantastical app but after this garbage update, it is terrible. I lost my 980 day streak after snapping the other person back and forth that day multiple times. The entire app is broken. The my story is completely changed. And the Snapchat layout is complete trash. After snapping people multiple times a day I still continue to somehow lose my streaks!!! TERRIBLE UPDATE used to be my favorite app. #BringBackSnap
This new update is terrible. Every time Snapchat updates it seems to get worse. Please stop trying to fix what's not broken. I have never heard so many people complain about an update in my life.
The new snap chat is terrible! I can’t find the stories from my friends and see stories from people that I don’t even know. It should come with instructions.
Just refuse to use it now. Why do these companies continue to add features they “think” we want. Looking for a new app to replace it now ... SMH
i liked it but i don’t like the update
زق
I hate this update! Who thought that this was a good idea ????
I freaakiinggggg hateeee the new update I’m so upset I lost most of my views because I’m now done wit snapchat until it goes back to it original !!
Go back to the way snap chat was before!
Why do you keep changing everything? Nobody wanted it, nobody asked for it. We were all happy whit how it was and now I can’t even swipe to open a chat? Won’t be long before you realize you messed up.
Ever since the new update I NEVER use Snapchat anymore! Millions of people are deleting the app because it’s not how it used to be @SNAPCHAT CHANGE IT BACK!!!!!
The new update is the worse thing you can do I don’t even try to look at story’s anymore. Thanks
By updating it you overall made the app hard to use and less appealing to look at please fix
Some of the features on the latest update don’t work on my phone. I’ve apparently downloaded two versions of the same update yet neither of them allow me to use multiple text boxes nor different fonts.
Thanks for the lovely time of memories i made with this app now its time for me to move on to instagram.Delete untill its back !!
I hate you Snapchat period !!!
I never thought I would stop using Snapchat but I might have to after this recent update. I also never thought I would use this 9th grade vocab word but I ABHOR this update. Absolutely disgusting, gross, hideous. Who even thought there was a need for an update??? This update may actually be the worst blunder since the charge of the light brigade.
My snap keeps bugging and kicks me off. It’s up to date. This new update is the worst!
Update was horrible , never using the app again.
The new update makes the app entirely unusable. DO NOT EVEN BOTHER
Absolutely hate the new update! I’m being forced to open people’s stories that I’m not interested in seeing so I’m quickly tapping through them and wind up messing the stories of the people I want to see! Please consider going back to the previous format!
I recently deleted Snapchat because of it newest update. It’s horrible!!!
I HATE SNAPCHAT. i used to like it, until u put a STUPID update on it. nobody likes it. please update it back to the old way!!
We want the old Snapchat back
I literally give this app a bad rating BECAUSE I hate the update, before the update everything was easy to access and manageable, now I can’t even find the list of my friends and if I accidentally add someone I don’t want to add there’s no way for me to unadd them because I have no clue what their username is. No longer in love with snap.
Horrible change it back !
Please go back to the old update! This new update is absolutely horrible.
I love Snapchat . But ever since the update nobody has been using it that much and it’s very difficult to understand. I think the old update should come back
Ugh the new update is absolutely horrible! Makes me want to delete it completely! Please please please change it back, no one is happy with the update! It’s all over the place i hate it! The old version was awesome!!!!
Hate the new update. It makes viewing stories difficult. The setup is weird. Please bring back old Snapchat.
The new layout is terrible. I wish snapchat would change it back but they won’t. They don’t care about their users opinions. After all the reviews, criticisms and even petitions with over a million signatures to change the app back, they still don’t care. All that matters to them now is money. With the new update, public stories from celebrities are now able to be monetized (only for some users). They’re even able to check analytics on their story posts. I used to love snapchat; I’ve had it for 5 years. I was constantly on snapchat. Now, I hardly even open the app. This update also allows for users that you don’t follow to appear in your stories. Why would we want to see people we don’t follow? Also with this feature, some of my friends have their preferences to where anyone can look at their stories without being their friend. So half of my friends are in one place and the other half are in another and I don’t want to have to try to search for them to view their stories. Snapchat just needs to go back to its simple and easy to maneuver around layout.
Snapchat was amazing before the update why would they do this
Very very bad idea I used to rate as a 3-4 now a 1. Even considering taking my phone all together
please go back to the old version the update is confusing and I don’t think anyone likes it
This new update is absolutely terrible! Please change it back to the way it was. I don’t even care to use this app anymore and I am considering just deleting it. It’s a shame because Snapchat was one of my favorite apps to use.
I don’t like the new update! I want the old Snapchat back!
Undo this flaming pile of nonsense that is this update
Snapchat was great until they released the new update that made it difficult to use and confusing
Snapchat, it’s officially been 2 weeks. It’s time to revert. You’re making me very upset. I am 99% close to losing my streaks, deleting the app, and posting my stories on Instagram. Get rid of the update
Update.... The app is still trash. Is there a zero star option? 
This new update is not only confusing, but really aesthetically appalling. Finding specific stories is nearly impossible, and tapping on the small icon in the corner to see these stories is difficult. Bad move Snapchat!
the new snapchat update shouldn’t exist. pls fix it. thank you:)
Taking my talents back to Instagram 🤷🏾‍♀️✌🏾
New update is terrible
The new version is really bad, in confuse :( I miss the old Snapchat
everyone has decided to hate on Snapchat regarding the new update but I think everyone is really over reacting. Snapchat just looks different but still has the same purpose. y’all need to stop hatin i think it looks really cool and updated. don’t get me wrong the discovery page is not the best but it’s not the worst.
Snapchat you need to put the old Snapchat back I don’t like this update as well as others it sucks👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
This update is nice but the only thing that’s wrong with it is that it doesn’t load when u looking for something also it makes my snap glitch
I on the other hand love the update.
So I wasn’t gonna be one of these people who went on and reviewed the app after the update, but y’all continue to update the app and make it even worse than it has already been made. I can’t even swipe right to chat with someone anymore on their name. Now there’s this new tab to view stories and group chats separately, which is SO stupid, inefficient, and obnoxious. On top of that, the new update is so confusing, frustrating, and just about as worse as you can get from what the app used to be— a fun way to communicate with people that everyone loved. Y’all have a lot of work to do to win back your fans and make people love this app, because so far we are all extremely unhappy. Take the update back.
Bring old Snapchat back please.
What possessed these people to make a wonderful app a shitstorm that I’m probably going to give up on and delete. It’s hard to find stories, see where someone has sent you a chat, and just read things now. It’s a jumbled mess. They need to go back to the good days.
Okay forreal.. y’all need to do better. Y’all don’t know the amount of people complaining about this new update... y’all needs to come together and think about it. Cause y’all reviews ain’t looking good, and also... my SNAPCHAT IS STARTING TO GLITCH.
Snapchat update is horrible!
Please bring back the old update. The new one is terrible🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️🤬🤬
Ok so Snapchat is my favorite apps ever but since the new update it just feels like its more friendlier to sponsors than us like the discovery page is to much put the story back on that page and put the discover back like i would leave liek instagram looks better than this now
The redesign looks too complicated. Keep it simple. Bring back the old Snapchat! I absolutely loathe the Discovery page. Why are there soooooooo many profiles? I only want to see my subscriptions. It’s extremely cluttered & hard to find the stuff you actually want to see. I find myself scrolling all the way down to nonsensical crap. I don’t care about popular stories of people I do not know. Bring back the old Snapchat! I don’t even like Kardashian-Jenners, but I am glad Kylie tweeted that comment about no longer opening Snapchat. It’s probably ‘coz the redesign is horrible! Did I say it already...oh yeah, I did: BRING BACK THE OLD SNAPCHAT!!!!
The new sc update ruined it for me. I’ve been using sc for a long time and now I stopped using it from this trash update
trash
I was the slick type to just swipe a little and look at messages now I don’t know what is going on like it just got more complicated other than that, Snapchat was my life but no I’m second guessing on what imma use cuz my reputation on having 100 and more chats not opened is not going so well and, also I can’t even see who actual text even when I wanted to open it up.
I have been using Snapchat for a very long time and this new update is just a waist of time. I eventually deleted Snapchat and then recently got it again hoping the update was gone. NEWS FLASH, IT’S NOT AND IM ABOUT TO DELETE THE APP AGAIN.
We all want the old update back
I used to love snapchat but I guess like everyone I started hate the new update. It makes me so lost finding my friends stories. If we stopped using the app no company will pay for their ads.
This update tragic 🙅🏾‍♂️🧢💯
After Snapchat updated I started hating it and now barely use it anymore. Not to mention that it says it updated again and said that I should have fonts but still nothing. I’ve tried deleting Snapchat then restarting my phone but still not fonts and I still stuck with the new crappy Snapchat with nothing cool on it no perks. Overall I say Snapchat went down the drain and they tried to make it better with fonts and gifs but it’s didn’t work at all, I want old Snapchat back.
I barley ever go on sc anymore
This update is horrible everyone wants you to go back
If you guys want to be smart undo this crap update. You guys have already lost a lot of users. Even your review on the App Store dropped tremendously. No one likes this.
Please please please stop hating on my favorite app! The latest update has fixed the issue of separating your friends and stories so please fix your reviews! We can't let Snapchat die! We all love the awesome filters and watching our friends and they lives in 10 seconds or less. Don't forget where all the other apps got stories from and filters from!
THE NEW UPdATE IS HORRIBLE !
Is there a way to get the old snapchat back?
Snapchat was my absolute favorite form of social media since it was always super easy to use and allowed me to keep in touch with my friends easily. A few weeks ago I deleted all my social media EXCEPT snapchat... well my app updated without my permission(????) and now I absolutely hate it. Update = plague.
Get the old snap back .
السناب
Make a streak button🤷🏽‍♀️
The new update is T E R R I B L E!
New update has made the app unusable.
I understand things change. Facebook updates, people complain, and then you get used to it. No biggie. This last Snapchat update is like having diarreah while vomiting at the same time. I just swipe around aimlessly until I get where I need to go. It’s so wonky. Don’t change for the sake of change. Please. I may delete....
Honestly the old update is wayy better. I hate how the new update is hard to use.
I loved the app really easy and fun to use but now with the new update I can’t send streaks, I don’t know when someone opens my Snapchat but doesn’t reply and my views went down a lot
The version pre February 2018 was absolutely perfect in my opinion. It was clean and organized. However, it’s changed too much in the last month. It’s all jumbled and cluttered in one screen while the other is exclusively for celebrities, icons, and companies (which is completely worthless to me). I honestly only used snapchat for the “chat” feature for a text messaging replacement to save storage, but it’s unfortunately been all but removed. Now there’s no real reason for me to use this app anymore and I’ll unfortunately lose contact with a few people because of this.
I have recently been using the update and it isn’t the best. I have been a user of snapchat for a long time now and I love it but ever since the update came out it has really disappointed me.
I don’t like the new update of u can take mines back to the old update please‼️💯
🤷🏻‍♂️ stop making stupid updates
Can we pleas have the old update back these updates r just making everything worse😭😭😭😭😭😩😩😩😩
What have you done Snapchat? This update is T R A S H and you know it and you don’t have the decency to change it back. I’m disappointed in you Snapchat....
I don’t like the fact that the stories and messages are now all in the same place. It makes it look messy, and sometimes I can’t even see when someone sent me a message because the messages go all over the place. It was way more organized before, when the messages and stories were in two separate places. And now with the newest update, Many others and I don’t like that you can’t swipe to see someone’s message anymore. You’d need to tap it to open it completely. Sometimes you just need to swipe, not all the way, to know what they sent first and then decide if you want to open it completely. Please change Snapchat back to the way it was. It used to be my favorite app and now it doesn’t even make me want to use it anymore.
Was a great app. Now it's a mental health threat because it's pretty much designed to keep you on it.  You used to be able to pick and choose what you want to see and read and whose stories you wanna see. Now it's just everywhere with irrelevant Stories of people you don't know or care about. also it looks like they "splattered" the background down and said "here's your interface to message people oh and here's some endless news that's usually garbage". Thanks for the downgrade oh wait I mean "update". 
I thought they changed it back but no they made the update even worse. Where i can’t even slide to text. I have to search my friends name up. This is so stupid. Tbh I’m gonna delete sc if they don’t change it back.
Disappointed you aren’t taking in what your consumers want. Something needs to be done about the small text for people who have sight problems and story and snap page  too crowded to be able to functions and use the app. I wish you would look at what the people want  and make the changes to make them happy..
you went down so many ratings it’s not even funny. snap used to be the best app in the world until this update happened no one likes it PLEASE put it back so i can download the app again you’re getting so much hate
Trash bro. C’mon
new snap update is terrible so complicated and not even worth it. i used to be obsessed with snapchat and on it 24/7 every day now i’m barley on it. hate it.
it was better when stories and snaps people sent you were separate and now the wold right side of the app is just stuff nobody cares about and ads.
I, typically, use this application multiple times a day. Ever since this last update occurred, force closing is a constant when I exit a thread. This is VERY discouraging.
I enjoyed using Snapchat ! Once it updated I no longer know how to use it. I’m unable to see videos of those I added. I’m having difficulty even trying to figure out why half of my videos are separated. I’m not satisfied with the update.
About specific people I’m following their stories are mixed in with PAID content.  I don’t want to see paid content.  Have to constantly open & close the app to get out of the excessive forced viewing of paid content.  I’m done with this app.  Deleting
BRING BACK THE OLD UPDATE !
The recent update is horrible. I once loved this app and now I barely use it. Switch it back.
The latest update is absolutely horrible. There is no getting used to it. It needs to be changed back or it will be deleted. Wish could give zero stars
This app was my favorite one, I loved posting Snapchat stories and used it as my primary way of communicating with everybody. However, that's all going to change now. I thought people were overreacting about the new update until my Snapchat updated. This is absolutely terrible and I'm not somebody who usually complains about changes to social media but this makes me want to delete my Snapchat. This design is not well done and just irritates me every time I go on the app now.
I hate the new update. It’s awful. I want the old Snapchat back
Just go back.
I only like the update because my views went up a lot from 120 average to 340 average!!! So yeah BUT IT IS BAD FOR EVERYTHING ELSE. ITSELF HARD TO UNDERSTANd and COMPLETELY out of chronological order!!!!!
This blows
Ok well snap is awesome for a 13 year old like me to see girls often that’s the only way but when there’re making it harder for me with the new update I just don’t like it. That being said for guys like me anyone reading this help make it easier for us it’s not fair
This update is terrible. Too confusing. No amount of time will make it better. Needs to be made simple again.
No one asked for this unneeded and over complicated update. It was perfect that way t was before. Stupid garbage, I didn’t see a reason for this app to lose popularity before but after this abysmal update I can see why so many people are walking away.
The new version of Snapchat is alright but people honestly isn’t into it , we prefer the old looking version because the story setting on the new version is confusing and we do not like it .
UPDATE IS SOOOOO STUPID
Honestly I hate the new update!! Please change it back!! Or fix it please
Snapchat update terrible! Bring back the previous one ! DO NOT GET IF YOU DONT ALREADY HAVE IT
I really don’t like the update. The articles are all mixed up, because of this it is hard to find articles.  When I’m done looking at one article it automatically goes to the next one. I don’t like that.   Also, when someone I’m subscribed to uploads something new to their story, I can’t just see the new snap. It makes me go through their WHOLE story. I already saw their previous snaps, I don’t need to see them again. So frustrating. Please do something to improve the app. Don’t ignore your users. The users are the ones that made the app popular in the first place. 
This update is about confusing as a old lady in the store tht don’t know where the saltine crackers are . Lost all my respect on this app. about to slide to kik like im in the 7th grade again 😭 come on now step it up and change it back .
My Snapchat is very important to me and I connect with lost of my friends on here . I hate how this new update works! Terrible
Used to give Snapchat 5 stars. This new update is so terrible I now can only give it 1
Newest update is trash, when are you going to change snap back to the good good?
I never updated it, it did it on its own ? Really annoyed.
BRING BACK THE OLD SNAPCHAT. IT WAS WAY BETTER. YALL ARE TRYING TOO HARD!!
Never once in my life have I written a review on an app. But this has brought me to it. This new update is trash. It put itself on our phones because it is trash and they knew it. Fire whoever was in charge because they don’t ever deserve to be near Snapchat again. If this doesn’t change soon, will be deleting Snapchat because right now it is garbage.
I used to love snapchat and there are so many great features to it; the timer on photos, the streaks, the memories; but this update just makes everything so much less convenient. I feel I have to give the app one star just to add to the chance that the snapchat team will address their dropping reviews and frustrated users. I don’t want to tap through all my snapchat friends’ stories just to find the new ones I’m actually interested in, and I don’t want to see stories of random people in discover. I would hope at least for users to be given the option of using the old version (I have been searching for some loophole way to do so). I would delete the app if it were not for the ease of sending picture and video snaps, essentially all the earliest features of the app not offered on any other apps I know of. If a competitor to snapchat were to come at this point I would readily consider it.
Your really trynna test people’s patients and not change it back watch how much more business you guys loose bc you refuse to change it back to the only friggen layout
look I’ve been patient I’ve been kind but Snapchat just keeps updating and for the WORSE I can’t use my snap it annoys me it wants to take me to stories went I want to slide into a chat you can do better than this snap
it’s so difficult to manage. its new format is so difficult and still confusing. people are very disinterested in watching stories and using the app.
To all you haters of the new update. Guess what. They put a lot of time and effort into making the new update and I would know cuz my sis helped make it. I’m not saying I LOVE it I’m saying I LIKE it.
Every time i open someone’s snap the app crashes and i don’t get to see what the other person has said.
They just keep making it worse and worse every time I open up my Snapchat app there some new update that makes it even harder to use
The new update is really annoying and it takes me so long to find all of my friends snap stories. Please go back to the old format.  Update: it’s a been few weeks and i still hate the format and it’s still ugly and I still like the other one better. Please just change it back. No one likes it and Snapchat literally does not care, I thought it was all about user satisfaction, but whatever. I guess just keep doing the worst 
the new update ruins completely ruins snapchat
I gave it a few weeks, still don't like it. I follow more tv stars/insta celebs/stuff like that more so than friends and that's literally pointless now. Some of them are still there in the discover section, but there's so much other crap there, I can't ever find those I want to see... I just want to scroll and see them. Everything else is crap too. Too confusing and cluttered. Please go back to the last update :(
If it’s not broken, don’t fix it.
Yeah the new update still did nothing to fix the last one
hateeeeee the update y’all needa switch it back.
Plain and simple🤪
The update is horrible and you really need to change it back I love snapchat too much to delete it . Other than that the app is good
reverse the update. y’all literally lost money bc kylie jenner said she doesn’t open the app
I have used Snapchat for communication, stories, etc. Receiving these updates were very confusing, having stories and chat in the same place blah blah blah. Since this is very new, glitches have been popping up like crazy. I take pictures on a normal basis like streaks, stories, pics, etc. But, when I try to take a picture it freezes, turns my screen black, then crashes. I am very frustrated of this. I'm also very concerned about the update, Every thing would be solved by going back. Since then, the rating stars have plummeted 3 stars. 4.8>1.8.
The update ruined the app
Go back to previous update
I hate the new update I deleted Snapchat because of it
It’s really confusing
This update where it changed the layout all around it’s pointless we were happy already with regular Snapchat now we have this weird looking sc and occasionally it force closes it didn’t do that in the past I don’t know what is going on but someone needs to make this better at least
Change the stories back instead of putting it all together, very confusing
Hate the new Snapchat update want to go back to the way used to be it is so hard to use it now almost lost multiple streaks because I couldn’t Find people I had streaks with please can we just go back to the way used to be
Honestly it deserves no stars the update is retarded
This new update really has everyone messed up. Snapchat was much better when incoming snaps and stories were on separate pages, and the snaps were organized normally. I’ll open a snap and go to reply just to see that after I open it, the name disappears and I have to scroll all around to find it again. Do everyone a favor please and go back to the way it was.
This update honestly has been the worse thing that happened to snapchat . it is confusing and stupid . please reverse this NOW !
I’ve loved staying connected to friends through Snapchat, but since the new update I have no desire to even open the app. 😰
Just when you thought the update couldn’t get worse it did, like they added slides to group chat story and all and now I can’t see what a friend said without hem knowing I read it , and I liked tht feature because sometimes if I person is being irrelevant I won’t hav to answer without leaving them on open.
Ok so at first with the new update I hated it but iv gotten used to it but one big problem I'm having is the new fonts, I’m still stuck with the old big or middle font, I don’t have those extra new fonts and I’d love to have those if the developers or someone could help me please, other than that snapchat is still pretty good.
I cannot send anything from my camera roll it just loads.
snapchat used to be my favorite app, i would go on it everyday. now since the update it’s so hard to use. no matter how many people complain it seems that snapchat will not listen to the people and go back to the way it used to be. no wonder it has a 1.8 review rating.
edit: after all the bad reviews why haven't they changed it back?? so annoying. I hate that the chats and stories are on the same side and the discovery is bigger. it's annoying. the whole look is ugly now. I liked the way it was before. they should really update it to be less cluttered and easier to use. it's just so messy and is not good at all. they didn't even warn us in the update description that this was happening. they better change it. 
The new update is very disappointed!!! We want the old version from snapchat!!! 
This update is horrible, literally nobody likes it ! So go back to the other one before this but keep the gifs
So I see you have upgraded that really bad update but the problem now is that I can’t peek anymore. That’s when someone snaps me and I slide on the chat to see what they said without necessarily having to fully open the message, I can’t do that because when I try to it just sends me to the stories little category. :’( I’m like tryna see what people telling me to avoid them
I remember when snapchat made sense...I miss the good ol days 😔
We hate this update, it’s obvious. So change it? Do I really need to go into detail? Not to mention all the glitches with these new updates...
!
This latest update with the friends feeds being in with the messages is no good! Put it back, or make another swipe screen but don’t mix it in with messages. It’s annoying.
I have used snapchat for years and have loved it. Recently I have been noticing that i’ve been using it less and less because of the new update. even people I know who just downloaded the app say that the app is jumbled and complicated to use. it took me three days to figure out everything and it’s been a couple weeks and I still cannot stand it. change is good but so much at once is not. stories are hard to get to if you want to see them again, it’s hard to see discover stories because they’re in a different order everyday, and i’m seeing stories from celebrities and people who i’ve never heard of. I use the app to keep in touch with friends, and, after the discover update (which was a useful update), look at different news stories. I don’t want to see recommendations for new people. if I really wanted to see a celebrity on my feed, I can just as easily look them up online and add them myself. you all screwed up. very badly. you’re a good company and I expect that you’ll revert back to the old layout. if not, everyone better sell your stock, because this app is going in the toilet.
Snapchat used to be great and then they tried to keep up with insta and Facebook and lost the race. They need to go back to the update before they switched “faces”. I never view any of the celebrities stories that I follow anymore. Hope you’ll make some changes soon before you lose another $1.7BILLION.
This new update is horrible and I do not like it at all. please change Snapchat back because this update and change is very unusual and confusing . I actually no longer use this app as much as I used to smh ...
The new snap chat update changes the interface and makes it more about adds and less about actually just talking with people you like. The devs seem to just fail to realize that while stories and ads can be a part of the app, they should be so, exclusively on the right side. The new integration makes everything jumbled and hard to understand and use.   The simplicity and thus the attraction of this app is gone, and at this point it’s just pretty unfortunate that this company seems to dominate this part of the market.   I hope they will revert the changes they have implemented in the last few updates. It really is bad 
Seems right gut, but all evasive reviews are hidden
you should add polls to story so we can make votes
UPDATE IS TRASH ‼️ BRING THE OLD SNAP BACK ‼️ IM SPEAKING FOR A LOT OF USERS ‼️
Okay just because you change it to where you can separate groups, stories, and all doesn’t make it any better!! WE WANT THE OLD VERSION NOT A CHANGED NEW VERSION
Being able to make multiple text and change the font and other small features is nice. But I don’t like how the new story is.
New update💩👎🏽
The update is beyond garbage. The thing that pisses me off the most is when I swipe right to read a snap it goes to stories. Please have a reverse update  Thanks - snap user 
I understand that apps get updated and things change.... but this update is horrible
This new snapchat update is horrible and super confusing. It is clear that EVERYONE else hates it so why not change it back to when it was simple.
Used to be good. Obviously everyone hates the new update so listen to the majority and change it
The update is overall Terrible
Snap was great before these past few updates. Now it’s a pain in the ***
I haven’t really used Snapchat since the redesign. Big mistake.
It is an inconvenience to change the set up that everyone is used to now I don’t even use the app I use everyday. I would like to see a change back but if not I wouldn’t use it anymore.
I used to use Snapchat every single day, all day. And since the new update I open snapchat once a week. If that.  Also I used to get 100 or more views on my story, ever since the update I maybe get 20-30. My friends barely even open snapchat now. Please change it back. 
I don't like Bitmoji!  I don't like stories!  I don't like the new home page!  I HATE THIS UPDATE! BRING BACK OLD SNAPCHAT! TOO MUCH INTERFACE! 
After getting used to the new update, I still hate this app. It’s hard to find my group chats, the popular stories I’m subscribed to, and my friends get buried under people adding to their stories. There was a rumor that snap would go back to their old format and that hasn’t happened. I’m seriously considering deleting the app altogether because it’s unorganized and not nearly as user-friendly as it used to be.
It’s ight the update is okay but my main problem is the filters pleaseeeeeeeeee take off the dog filter or the flower crowns OR BOTH  and put back in the filter that says the time in the top and looks like a recording and it says (your snap name) and the day at the bottom corner PLEASEEEEEEE
This app is ridiculous. Doesn’t listen to customer feedback. Slaughtered the old app design into a completely uncomfortable rework that clearly no one likes. Insta is better.
Move the garbage icon so I don’t keep deleting my text box by accident when I try to move it up
The new update has been atrocious, an attempt by Snapchat to increase ad revenue while screwing over its users. Will stick to other social media options for now
HOW DO U UNUPDATE???!!!??? This update is pissing me off, plus I didn’t even turn on autoupdate and I DID NOT PRESS THE UPDATE BUTTON, pls downgrade ASAP or else im definitely deleting this s**t
I love the update. It puts everything I need in one spot. All my friends messages and stories are all in the same place.
Yall always fixin everything except for the stuff we ask for
It’s great that you’ve come out with updates since the horrible one, but like.. can u just stop making changes and put it back? Lol
I realize that everything evolves... but this update is a mistake. I gave it a few weeks to at least try it out and honestly the only reason I’m going to keep the app at this point is because I use it often for communication purposes. I am not fond of the new layout and probably won’t be using the stories feature anymore.
New update is miserable
I have been using snapchat for a long, LONG time now. I’ve been using since it didnt have the text chats, and you can only send photos. Ive been using it since it only had the pen. Ive enjoyed almost EVERY update, especially when they introduced the first time you can write on the text box, more than just a line. I genuinely gave this update a chance, but i just cant. Now its just crap. Ive spent so much money on this app, like buying filters, and paying to replay snaps.(yes this use to be a thing)  Not anymore. Im giving up this app until i see a substantial change, until then im giving it only a 1 star, just because i cant have a 0 star.   RIP snap😭 
The swiping between group, stories, and all is just annoying. I don’t like not being able to swipe to see chats. Adding gifs and the different text options is better, but overall, the new update is still very annoying. I only use Snapchat to keep up with my streaks. I really don’t like how the snaps fall out of order of you sending them either. Go back to the old layout
Whose idea was it to update the ENTIRE SNAPCHAT app?!? Worst update ever, disgrace to human kind. Reverse PLEASE!!!!
my memories won’t load. please fix this..
The new update is very inconvenient! Lots of people are upset and want the old one back!!
yeah so basically my snap automatically updated on it's own with out my permission and honestly, i feel attacked. update? more like downgrade! everything is mixed together. uh if i a mess i would have opened up instagram instead. i want a refund because this is not what i asked for!!!
I wouldn’t hate the update so much if the stories would be separate from my chats. It is so annoying to have to constantly clear conversations in the settings because they don’t disappear after viewing their stories and I only chat with 5/20 of my friends. I dislike having the chats sit there when I am not snapping the people I see stories from, also the newest update did make a group and story section but not a chat section as the old original version that keeps chats and stories separate like y’all just got a story section why not a chat section instead of a all section? If u guys fix this I actually wouldn’t mind the update and would change my rating to 5 tbh, but until then it’s a 1 because it’s so dang frustrating.
They changed the simple and vibrant Snapchat that used to be, to a very complicated and frustrating app. Honestly a social network app shouldn’t have to be this complicated. I already deleted mine
Traaaaaaaash!!! 👎🏼
I just the got the update and I hate with a strong passion like what r u doing snapchat your dying in our eyes!! Promise you
use to love snap now am not a fan with this new update
Everything is complicated and annoying now, I miss the old version. I gave it a chance and still hate it.
The latest update ruined this app smh
Snapchat I don’t understand why you completely ruined the app.  It’s extremely hard to navigate now... so thanks for fixing what wasn’t broken 😡😡
The new update makes it not worth getting. It is so frustrating with all the Bitmoji things like I just wanna snap my friends not see my friends creepy anime characters. Don’t install.
I’m very upset snapchat continues to ignore the pleas to revert back to the previous version.
please to return that version because this version it’s so bad and i don’t like it😔
App constantly glitches and freezes up. Snapchat will exit out on itself and doesn't load properly.  Also, the new update is horrific. 
Started off as an app for quick nudes to a social media hub to over done garbage. Deleted.
So frustrating and annoyed with this new version!! Bring back the old Snapchat!!
It was the best! After the new update it being the worst app I have!! 
Ughhhhhhhhhh Why. Just why? I mean it was FINE and now I don’t even know how to use it. No one I know likes it I don’t like it And just. UGHHHHH I HATE IT. And the only thing that has kept me from deleting it is Streaks. 😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑 
I can’t talk with anyone really and everything is cluttered. I accidentally almost send messages all the time because the stories and messages are at the same places and I can’t watch my favorite stories from like tasty or vogue because I don’t know where they are and so I miss a lot of enjoyable content.
Well, I gave it a week. Snapchat did not go back and I still could not figure the app out.  Hated the update and how unorganized it was.  Just deleted my account and will not be back unless they change this update.
Snapchat’s customer satisfaction is at an all time low. They need to understand that they should stop doing what they think is what’s best for us users who actually use the app on a daily basis. Ever since the launch of the discovery page, it seems as they lost all care into making us, the consumer, happy. I see it as them doing all they can for money especially with what happened with their stock falling hard last year.   Snapchat is becoming less and less easy to use. Every huge update comes with more cons then pros, more bugs, more confusion, and more negative reviews. Please, workers at Snapchat, listen TO US. It is not what you want, it is what we want.  Thank you 
This new update is even worse than the last!  I hate that you can slide over when someone sends you a chat.  We need the old snapchat back.
This update is absolutely the worst thinks ever. For starters I don’t usually do reviews but I hate this update so much I have to. Either re-update snap, reverse it to normal, or fix some problems or else me and thousands of others will most likely delete the app this really pisses me off the update was not necessary by any means. You’ll get a 5 star rating back when you fix this update until then the rate stays a 1 I wish I could give it a -5. I urge everyone to delete the app until there is a new update that actually works. I know I am. Anyways Snapchat, I suggest you get to work because you are going to loose a lot of customers. This is worse than the time you attempted to make us pay for replays lol.
When is Snapchat going to revert back to previous layout? You should listen to the people that use the app. I used to love this app and now I don’t even use it. I just want the old Snapchat back. With out the stupid ads and click bait articles. I was hoping with this recent update it would go back. But no. The disappointment is real.
Can you please bring it back to the way it was or let us choose if we want it this way or the old way because this is ugly
Updated without my permission. Update is absolutely wack. Deleting Snapchat right after I finish writing this review.
The title says it all. The newest update is really bad and confusing.
I love Snapchat it is so awesome! The only part I dislike is the new update, it is sometimes confusing. I liked the original one better!
Snapchat used to be a great app. But , the update made snapchat very glitchy and just not as great as it used to be .
Snapchat is amazing I use it all the time but with this new update it's not as fun as it was before. You have to go to chat to see friends stories. In my opinion the update is not good but you may like it
Before the update I loved using Snapchat. The usability was never a problem and navigating the app was simple. However, since the recent update (complete remodel) I find myself using the app way less. Viewing stories has become a drag, and interacting with people has become harder. So PLEASE either revert back or change the layout for the better.
The new update socks honestly it so confusing
Just stop no one wants these updates I don't even know why you want these updates
New update is absolutely terrible... Completely unusable.
New update is awful.
Trash app, change it back...immediately
This update is terrible please change it back
the new update is terrible
Since the new update I have a people I never added them my friends I have to different page to see their snaps  No more snap. 
I use Snapchat everyday to talk to friends. I don’t appreciate this last update and I didn’t have an option not to update because my phone does it automatically. Just like he app vine, I can only see Snapchat tanking and becoming something of the past if this update isn’t corrected.
Please bring back the original format
I really hope Snapchat fixes the update to something more sensible the update is the oposite of what I was hoping for it’s a big mess with nothing working the way I would like it too
I hope ur company dies
Honestly used to love Snapchat but now I can’t help but get frustrated every time I use it. The app in incredibly disorganized and shoves a mass amount of media down your throat. No longer chronological either. #BringSnapBack
Everything is so confusing and jumbled. Big thumbs down 👎
I love Snapchat I use it like everyday but this new update sorry to say is wack
Don’t be surprise if people stop using your new app because of the new format.
م
The new design makes so much more sense, so glad to see a company willing to shake things up, despite public outrage, to grow and evolve.
The update it’s trash no one use it anymore we want the old Snapchat
I absolutely hate how you have to watch peoples snaps individually and public snaps in the discover page it's terrible I would enjoy if you just deleted the update all together it's just stupid
Your update is crap. And you’re a jerk for not listening to the millions of consumers who hate it. Peace out.
I get really confused using the new Snapchat update. I really don’t like it and please change it back
I really dislike this new update I find the old snap better. Please fix this and bring the old snap back
Pretty nifty that you can slide over and just see Groups, Stories, or All but I think the most useful thing would be a tab only showing “sent/received snaps”  Or just undo the update... 
So my phone decided to update snapchat and I get this update and it’s terrible! I have to scroll through my friends snaps to find their stories instead of swiping to the right and clicking on their stories. And it doesn’t categorize your streaks so I have to scroll through hundreds of people to get to my streaks.
Okay so the update was okay. I didn’t like the fact that I didn’t have a choice whether to update or not (because of my settings). I think a better way to do it is have a little pop-up saying ‘hey, snap has updated! Would you like to try it?’ And then have users try it for a few days, then have an option on whether to keep it or not.   The update was hard to get used to, but I’m used to it now. Instead of repealing the update which I’ve heard rumors of, I think users should have an option on whether to keep the update or not.   Some of my friends can’t wait to get back to the old version and others love the update.  I think users should have a choice whether to go to the old version or not. 
First and foremost, why would you change Snapchat in the first place, and second why change it and again and make it even more worse than before, first it was the whole look that changed and now you wanna change it to where you aren’t able to see what someone messaged you before opening it, take consideration of the people that are actually using the app, isn’t that the whole point of a social media for there to be a certain platform people prefer. Snapchat is just gonna die out like Facebook and Twitter
Please put stories back on the right and snaps in order of when you sent them last
So my phone has been super slow with the Snapchat updates. It just updated and it says I should have the different fonts but it’s not working 😭 someone help
fix the stories
The new update is terrible
They made it so hard to see my friends stories. I don't care about the bulk of discovery especially what chritie tiegan or Kylie Jenner do in a day(oops too soon) send snaps is annoying too. Maybe you should have tested this drastic update before implementing it. Good by marketshare
This update is promoting people I don’t even wanna see, I can’t even find stories any more, and the worst part about this is that I DIDNT EVEN HAVE AUTOMATIC DOWNLOADS ON and it did it on its own. Smh I’m highly disappointed in snap and I might have to just resort to ig stories at this point because snap is just ugly af now... if you haven’t updated already then please save yourself and don’t!
The new layout is trouble! Please go back to the old way.
Yall must’ve been on shrooms or something thinking to cluster f*** the whole great system that you had before, into s***. Going to IG til yall put your “realization-of-the-facts” caps back on and go back in time a bit. This is completely retarded. Read other people’s reviews for the specifics. Peace out SC🤪
It’s okay once you get used to it but PLEASE fix the bugs.  It’s freezes and is glitchy a lot of times now where before it never used to do that.
Snapchat is getting worse. You know how you use to slide to get to the chat part? If you do that now it sends you to a section where you can see many peoples stories. Its one of the dumbest things i’ve seen in a while. I believe snapchat needs to go back to its old style.
Plz fix this we all agree that this new snap is horrible and very confusing😭😒😒
I don’t think this snapchat is working out for everyone so can I please get my old snapchat back
Honestly the app is just stupid now you can’t even keep track of your friends because it’s so busy trying to show me their stories and not the friends I talk to should have just kept the old layout
..
How do you guys do something like remove the white borders but then take two steps back with this new layout. Please put it back to how it was before.
New update is terrible
Don’t like the new update😡
still hate it, still going to hate it. NO ONE LIKES THIS UPDATE ITS CONFUSING AND NO ONE CAM FIND ANYTHING AND WE CANT EVEN DELETE OUR CONVERSATIONS MULTIPLE AT ONCE PLEASE JUST BRING BACK THE OLD SNAPCHAT HOW MANY TIMES DO WE NEED TO ASK
GET RID OF THE TRASH CAN FOR TEXT BOX. whenever I try moving my text the entire thing gets deleted because of this ridiculous and useless feature, and you can’t even undo it. Snapchat used to be great but it’s only going downhill. Navigation is more complicated, you can’t see things in chronological order, the discovery page is even more difficult as everything is huge and you have to scroll a mile to find what you want. Absolutely hate the new update. Everything was made more complicated and less aesthetically pleasing. Don’t fix what’s not broken, I want the old version back.
How did somehow you guys get worse with the new update? I can’t even slide a text message to see what someone said anymore I think I am going to delete the app soon
The newest update forces us to watch everyone's story. I liked being able to individually pick whose story I wanted to watch, not be forced to watch all stories. GO BACK TO BASICS That's why snapchat became popular. It was fun and easy to use.
I’m going 5 stars because I feel bad for Snapchat
I used snap basically everyday for the past 2 years, but since the update I’ve used it twice. It’s just so....ew. Please change it back!!!
Ever since they forced this new horrible update the app is more confusing and cluttered. My guess is to force target ads for more revenue . All that is gonna end up happening is a new and better app will come out as people leave Snapchat
Congrats you outplayed yourself. Just give in to user demand and bring the old UI back. Your at a 1.8 out of 5. Your not apple. You can’t force users into things and just say they have to get used to it. So do us all a favor and change it back. Or fail up to you!
Y’all need to fix this take it back to the old Snapchat this new one is wired
I wish that the rating could go lower than 1, because that’s what i would give the new update. still. it’s still terrible. and it always will be.
Why did they all of a sudden make it so complicated. I literally hate it. I refuse to open it. It took me an hour to figure how to see people’s stories and the layout is confusing. The mixture of things you subscribe to with things you don’t is just ridiculous. Why would I subscribe if you are going to throw things I don’t care about at me anyway? Bye bye Snap. 😡
Not only that but I'm very close to deleting the app all together bc I'm getting frustrated goodbye.   Update: Now its like every other hour my streaks have a timer! Then they die and then they re-appear. My heart almost dropped when it said I lost a 330 day streak...But I didn’t💀💀 
I haven’t been this disappointed since my dad left me and never came back with this new update 🙅🏾‍♂️
The update isn’t the best but I’ll get used to it. Snapchat is still the best!
Snapchat WAS a great application and I used it more than any other social media platform by far because it was fun and easy to use. However, with the new update it refaced everything completely. Made stories jumbled with adds that we avoided before, and now just entirely a wall of boxes as stories. The conversation side of Snapchat is now one big cluster 🤬 of stories and messages and bitmojis. I see where Snapchat was trying to go and make everything convenient and easy to get to, but they made the page over whelming. My rating went from 5 stars to 1 along with thousands of other people until they either change it or make it better. Please just bring back the old style we all loved instead of creating a failing app
The new update is satisfactory. But nothing special anymore.
It’s impossible to see who you’ve responded and who all messaged you without having to scroll pass all the new stories. It is way too cluttered. Needs to be changed so that stories are separate from messages and subscriptions. I honestly am not surprised why people delete the app after the FORCED update.
PLEASE REMOVE THE UPDATE ASAP!!! NOBODY LIKES IT. PLEASE
All snapchat has to do is get stories out of the main feed and I will rate them right back at 5 stars again.
This update is terrible bring the old one back
change the update back we all hate it
I have been an avid Snapchat user since my parents let me get one at the age of 15. I have always loved the new things Snapchat introduced from Bitmojis to cute stickers. But the new look on Snapchat is just a little much. It has become hard to navigate and I miss the old layout. In the next update maybe add in the option to pick our own layout. Let us choose whether we want the new or older Snapchat layout. That way those who like the update can continue to use it but for those of us who are not as impressed can have the option to use the Snapchat we know and love.  Sincerely, The user who wants a choice 
i really dislike the new snapchat update it doesn’t show my recent snaps at the top. snapchat can you please bring the old layout back please☹️😩😩
I remove Snapchat from my phone and I do not like the new update and you insist on this update that is not wanted by millions 😡😡of people
(Edit) new update is okay
Be more like Twitter. Simple and effective. Twitter never changes like that. You guys sold out to advertisers and talking heads since you went to Wall Street.
They updated again now i can do my half way slide to see the messages 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
Whoever the ceo of Snapchat is, should get voted out of the company.
Worst update of all time.
Another update, Format is still trash.
Titles says it all...bring back the old Snapchat.
I still really hate the update.. please change it back to how it was it’s just not working and you know it 2
I used to love seeing my Bitmoji play around with stuff. BRING THEM BACK TO MY FILTERS!!!!!!!! Please and thank you☺️.
Every update just a adds tiny differences that make the app worse
Me and all my friends are disgusted with the new update! It is so unorganized! Snapchat updated while I wasn’t looking at my phone and I absolutely hate it! Please go back to the old one! R.I.P Snapchat 2011-2018 😭 STOP UPDATING SNAPCHAT 😭
Snap used to be my favorite social media platform now I hate it. Bring back the original Snap😤
I just received another automatic update (which I have my apps to where they do not automatically update) from snapchat and unsurprisingly it is absolutely terrible! Differentiating groups, stories, and all content is not a fix to the update everyone hates! Im at a loss for words due to the fact snapchat creators seem so out of touch with what their users are asking for! This is ridiculous and Im sure many others share my dissatisfaction. WE WANT THE OLD SNAPCHAT BACK THESE ARE NOT “GROWING PAINS” THIS IS GENUINE FEEDBACK THAT THE NEW SNAPCHAT INTERFACE IS TERRIBLE PLEASE LISTEN TO YOUR USERS
Edit: I’m done. I’m uninstalling it. It’s unbearable after the update.
YOUR UPDATE IS HORRIBLE. HOW ABOUT INSTEAD OF HOARDING MONEY AND ONLY CARING ABOUT PROFIT, YOU ACTUALLY LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS/APP USERS AND MEET OUR DEMANDS AND NEEDS. TO MAKE IT SIMPLE- CHAGE THE F*CKING APP BACK
My streaks are all over with my stories, this isn’t right. Please go back to the old update everyone dislikes it. The lenses are way too expensive so we could just use them for a few days, they should be free /:
Everything is everywhere no even user friendly
The latest version is horrible. It's difficult to use. It adds significantly more ads and undesired stories to my feed. I have been trying to patiently give it a chance to grow on me. It'd hasn't. I would not recommend this app anymore.
SNAPchat is gay now, fix it back to the old one
u should definitely get the old snapchat back.this one is officially. thank u!
I love this app and use it all the time, but I really don’t know what you were thinking when you changed the conversations screen. Now there’s people I never talk to on top in between my conversations. Please change it back or at least give us the option to make changes to who shows up on that screen.
Can we go back to the old version because this layout is very confusing and is just ugly
Snapchat please go back to the 10.23.1 update because everything was ok then now these new updates are getting out of hand and making my snap life and majority of everyone else's less fun. This new update I got today is not good it's actually worse than the first one you guise made this month, please just go back to the old snap we knew and loved. At least get me a separate page for my messages.
please Snapchat, I wish you would go back to the way you were before. Honestly, all my friends have deleted Snapchat and I’m considering doing the same thing. If I could give this 0 stars I would.
Hello Snapchat hello people that are reading this. Yes I hate the update and most of the users on Snapchat do to. I would no recommend this app the update is very dumb. My advice: DONT DOWNLOAD. :)
I’m sorry but I feel like the newest layout of snapchat is not proper and it is very unorganized. Until it goes back I am highly dissatisfied.
I HATE THE NEW UPDATE SMM!!
I want the old update back 🤕
Hi so I used to love Snapchat but now it has gotten so bad like For example I can never find stories anymore and it’s just awful if you could reverse it I think I’m not the only one who would benefit from it thank you
love Snapchat but I hate the new update. i tried making a private story and instead i added a bunch of people to a group chat and full on embarrassed myself so Snapchat can literally choke. but i’m still gonna use the app tho...
It’s trash tbh
I really love Snapchat for keeping in touch with friends and seeing what they are up to. I’ve also grown to like the new update and have gotten used to it. However, a lot of the snaps I send don’t really send. They just sit there saying “sending” forever. It’s been doing this since the update although it probably has nothing to do with it. I hope they fix this issue soon!
This new update is really terrible bring back the old Snapchat. 😌
Can you guys please make Snapchat go back to the way it was the way it is now is so 👎🏽👎🏽💯
I used to love snap but now I hate it. This update is ridiculous and im confused. Please give the old Snapchat back thanks.
I used to love snapchat! there were a select few friends who i talked to almost exclusively through snapchat's chat feature but now that the stories of my other friends have clouded my personal chat page, it's very cluttered and frustrating. it makes me not want to use the app at all. I also don't understand the discover page as it never features anything in remotely interested in. i'm very disappointed and will probably only be using Instagram stories from now on
App continues to go down hill. Snapchat use to be about communicating with your friends in funny and private ways. It’s not about discovering other people and there snaps. They don’t care about my snaps and I don’t care about there’s. The sense of privacy is gone. Trying to comply with Instagram and Facebook and Twitter is just pushing people away. Guess what...we already have Instagram and Facebook and Twitter. Your originality is gone. Do you guys even do focus groups before updating to see if people are going to like it? I’m guessing not because every update continues to cause you to lose users.
I love Snapchat that’s how i communicate with most of my friends but the newest update is really bad and i am considering removing the app.
Just when we were all starting to get use to the update, you change it again! This update is even worse than the other update you did.. very, very disappointed.
Y'all even Kylie Jenner said she hates the app now , what's it gonna take to change it back
SNAPCHAT NEEDS TO STOP RANDOMLY SHUTTING I STG I NEED MY CUTE PICS TO GET POSTED BUT NOOO SNAPCHAT HAS TO GLITCH
Keeps crashing .. I have the latest version on my iPhone 8 with the latest version of Snapchat.
I have not talked to the first person that likes the new update. Why did y'all change it. I see the ratings went to a 1 star in less than a week. Good job
I love the app but this update is terrible and they need to switch it back it’s so hard to use this app with joy
This is a horrible update and the worst part about I️t was that I️ couldn’t turn off the update. I️ turned off auto update and everything but the app still updated. This update is crap. Revert to the old layout!!!!
After so many complaints why won’t you guys go back to the old snapchat from last month? We were happy the way it was.
No, The update is horrible. Stop fixing things that aren’t broken. I dont want to watch everyones story back to back. The list of everyone was just fine so i could pick and choose. And i sure liked having the stories on one tab, and the personal snaps on another tab. Go back to the way it was. # makesnapchatgreatagain 
they updated their app in the worst way possible
I’d rather die than use this new Snapchat
The new update is disorganized, really bad. Change it back cause i was about to delete my snap because of it, i know how to use it but hardly, it’s really bad
Please from the bottom of my heart bring back the old Snapchat we all really miss it it’s like this new update has just completely ruined Snapchat and I just plead you please bring the old snapchat back!!!
The newest update is terrible. The snapchats should display in some type of chronological order.
snapchat was amazing. i was there when they tried to make us pay for filters. i was there when you knew how long somebody’s story was. i was there when there was 3 bestfriends. i slowly adjusted to the updates. but this? this is ridiculous. the update is disgusting. it’s so cluttered and unorganized and makes no sense. i don’t care about famous stories. i don’t know what the hell got into y’all when y’all were designing it, but it needs to go back NOW!!!
سيء جدااااا
the brand new update is better and i think many people will like it again
Worst update ever Very disappointing.
Bring the old snap back
The new update is ridiculous. It makes no sense and the format it absolutely awful. why would you read a story when snapping a friend. I can’t see all my friends stories. Im overall disappointed
I kinda sorta like the update but everyone would appreciate it if it was changed back:)
i think we can all agree snapchat was the app we all f*cked with but then this new update comes in and ruins everything like literally everything
The Snapchat update is terrible. The design is horrible and difficult to navigate through. Definitely won’t be getting used to this and more than likely I won’t continue to use this app
BRING THE OLD SNAPCHAT BACK!!!!
Plz can you add a change username option cause I don’t wanna regain all my Snapchat points and don’t wanna lose my streaks
The new update makes the app so hard to use. I only want to see my friends stories not the paid ones!! Very annoying... please bring back the old version. Bring it back
Can’t even find friends stories after they have been viewed
i like the old way better is it coming back
The new update is absolutely horrible. The app used to have a separate section for you to view stories and another separate side to receive snaps, now it’s all jumbled together! I do not understand how people like the new update at all. 
Thought it was supposed to go back to its old format. New snap is hard to navigate, my chat/convos are cluttered and its driving me insane. Plannimg on deleting the app until it goes back to its old template. If it never does, i will say goodbye to snapchat forever.
I’m not sure what snapchat is trying to do but it’s horrible. I honestly didn’t think this update could get worse and it has. Everything is still so disorganized. You don’t have a list of your friends or stories. Where the heck did alphabetical order ever go?
I hate the new update, I rarely use Snapchat anymore. If only they changed it back to the old Snapchat.
Don’t like this update, really enjoyed the update before this one. Please go back how you guys use to be 😭.
It’s soooooooo bad
Hate the new update!!! It’s annoying how all messages and snaps are all together!!! Can’t really tell when you have a new message. Looks so cluttered and difficult for the eye sight. It’s also Difficult to search for people.  I know several people who are no longer using snap. I think I just became one of them. If the format isn’t changed to what it was, Messages and snaps separated, then I’m sad to say that I’m gonna stick to IG and FB stories only!!!!
I regret to say that this app has brought complete and utter disappointment. Due to the atrocious Snapchat update, I will be avoiding the app at all costs. Snapchat not only came up with a stressful new way to go about it, but the company also is denying people of their need to get it changed back. With all due respect to the company and its workers, I am very disturbed with the update and I, along with many others, would appreciate it if you changed it back. Thank you.
The latest update, as I’m sure you’re already aware, is absolutely awful. Stories are no longer separate from sent or received snaps, and a giant confusing mess of various news articles can be found where stories and news used to be. I’m absolutely shocked that Snapchat has not yet responded to it’s users’ backlash. I would have no problem with the update if stories were back where they used to be, or once again separate from sent and received snaps. Despite having updated a while ago, I still find myself frustrated with the update daily. I would no longer recommend snapchat to anyone; there have been far too many problems aside from just the update. I’ve been using Snapchat for a long time, and I’m holding out for a while longer to see if they will fix things, but if they don’t I quite honestly don’t see myself using the app for much longer. 
Snapchat is an amazing app! The app I use all day...but, with the stories and the new update i’m not such a fan. I miss seeing everyone’s story because now i dont even know if someone has a story.
My snap was perfectly fine before the new update it seems like it has a virus please fix this problem Snapchat
How many times do we have to say WE DO NOT WANT STORIES MIXED IN WITH OUR CONVERSATIONS! THATS ALL WE WANT!
THIS UPDATED BY ITSELF AND IM PRESSED IM BOYCOTTING
Hate the new update
The updates are getting worse and worse. Fix this, as it gets annoying quickly.
Everyone agrees this updated version is terrible put it back to the way it was
Everyone should boycott this update
Headache of a design. Cluttered. Unorganized.
I would just like to know how my Snapchat updated on its own when I have auto-update turned off?! I even went into the App Store to check and it still has the “update” option on Snapchat because I intentionally chose to not let it update due to all the uproar over how awful this update is. I am beyond furious.
Snapchat has been a major app that been used by everyone and everyone loved it. But recently, Snapchat has made an update that didn’t really appeal to people. It was hard to navigate and the display was very different from the previous one. One major concern is mixing stories with recent chats. It was hard to watch stories and find the most recent ones. It seemed like they messed up the chronological order of the story feed. But one good thing is the new Bitmojis and cool filters that have been added. Also the discovery page is kinda unnecessary in my opinion. BUT now it seems like Snapchat has listened to our complains and categorized the mixed and clustered chat feed. “Groups” “Stories” and “All” it’s kinda similar of how your memories is divided into sections. Now it’s a little bit easier to navigate. My only problem is that there is no “ Recent Chat” section but I’ll accept this update. Still lots of room for improvement. So I’m giving it 4 stars because Snapchat actually listened to us and somewhat fixed the problem. Although, it’s easier than previously, this is still pretty hard to use which takes the joy out of it.
My friends and I say that this even newer update is worst than the last, they don't let you have a section for just the chats. It's a merge of everything, then there is a slide for just stories and group chats. The newest update is simply now the worst
the update is the worst thing y’all have done yet.
Hi, I am a Snapchat user, and I will love if you guys can give me back my old Snapchat because I am not feeling this new one!!! I will highly appreciate it thanks very much in advance 😊
Just please
Looks very messy and unorganized. I used to love Snapchat but the update has completely ruined the app.
This new version of Snapchat is awful.  No story lines .  They give u the impression you can view a snap more than once. Tap twice to replay.... doesn’t work
I used to use snap chat all the time but since the update don’t use it anymore.  The app isn’t as user friendly.
This is so bad it’s not even funny. Worst update since this app has been released. People actually get paid to come up with these ideas? Might want to get some new employees. Straight garbage.
The new update is afoul
In the chat side where the 3 icons are, there’s a section across the bottom of the screen where the blur just stops and goes clear again. Fix this to be either clear all the way up or blur it like the area around said icons for aesthetic appeal...seeing as you obviously don’t care about functionality anymore
literal cancer to look at. it updated without my permission and when i looked at it, i instantly gained ocular cancer. I knew my sudden blindness was the result of this new update. i tried to send a snap because i had motions imprinted in my fingers. but alas, i could not. i opened 30 stories trying to select the last person i snapped. then when i tried to actually send it, i felt that bestfriends were back! but in the worst possible way. i tried for hours until finally i gave into my primitive instincts and used imessage and texted my mother to come and blow my brains out and end my misery.
Horrible design.
DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME BY GETTING THIS APPLICATION. If you already have it don’t update it. Also, turn off automatically Download, so you won’t wake up with the new update. The application is horrible and confusing.
If I could give this zero stars I would It feels cluttered anytime I go to read someone's snap I end up tapping there story. And I had some snaps I opened in the morning and when I logged back on the app glitches and I got the same snaps.
I’ve always enjoyed Snapchat and always will! The new update I like the pictures on the side and the “do not disturb” but maybe the stories need to go back to normal with being easier to find on the third screen. Other than that it’s great
Get over the update. It happened, just deal with it.
where do you find the zodiac signs ?¿ and instead of doing random snaps on the story page you should put all of the people that you're friends w over there. nd after you open a snap it shouldn't go all the way to the bottom🙄
New update is worst
Change the app back how it was you greedy selfish company. Nobody likes this stupid new GUI
The newer update is worse. I hate it a lot. I now have to open all my snaps to get on a chat and it’s annoying. I can’t just swipe to open a chat. The other update was pretty bad but in my opinion, this one is worse. I like the old Snapchat format. Bring it back.
The maker and creator of Snapchat won’t even listen to his million of consumers that obviously hate the new update. Pitiful
Although Snapchat is my favorite application I have found it is not anymore. It is so difficult to use and is not as fun as it used to be. I'm not able to see people's story's as I used to and it constantly moves the people on my list. You have to scroll all the way down to even see private story's and it is hard to see what others are posting. Overall I think that the new update was a mistake and I know I'm not the only one that feels this way. I would LOVE if it went back to its's original state it was awesome then.
The new update is difficult to use and takes the convent element of Snapchat away. @snapchat bring back best friends not trash.
Impossible to watch stories. How awkward for you that it's easier to watch on Instagram. Maybe you should copy them now?
The new update is terrible you morons.
Worst update ever!! Go back to original
I would like to thank everyone who left one star reviews on snapchat. they have finally listened and took away that trash update. yhu made this possible
The new snapchat update is horrid.  it doesn’t make sense and when you don’t snapchat someone there story just pops up where you send it I recommend not getting this app!
Y’all need to take this update off!
New update blows, hardly wanna use it, can’t believe with all the negative comments about it they haven’t changed it back. Wouldn’t expect more from a company who didn’t sell for billions to instagram
💕👻😩
Not happy with that change. Super annoying!
It was a step in the right direction with this most recent update today that separates the friends page into groups, stories, and all, but I want a section that’s JUST incoming snaps from individual people, shown in the order they were sent, not in the order you think I want to see it. I won’t raise my stars until you make it more user friendly like t was before your update earlier this month.
The newest update of snapchat is worse than how it was with the new update in January
Update is terrible. Please show that you listen to your consumers and do what we want.
The new Snapchat update is confusing and everyone doesn’t like it
ADD POLLS!!!!!
The update is garbage
I️ like the way Snapchat was before this big update I️ honestly hate it
The layout in the newest update is pure trash. I’m pretty sure your developers were either slam drunk or major stoned when you wrote the update. The stupidest thing I’ve seen all this year. Change the app back and I’ll change this review.  -the most recent update is better. Still hard to find what I wanting. Please continue to change it back 
i dont mind most of the new updates at all i love most of them actually. one small lil complaint i have though is about how when i type out a long paragraph and i go to move it up it goes into the trash...? you shouldnt be able to trash text, if i wanted it gone i would just delete it all... i thought that option was only for stickers and i would like to have kept it that way. its very frustrating and is really hard to avoid considering i use my right thumb on the right side of the screen (where the trash barrel shows up) to move the text. thank you.
I hate everything about the update. I miss everything about the previous version. Truly so bad I am considering deleting Snapchat altogether.
this update is terrible
Snapchat used to be my exclusive social media outlet. But with the new update I’m planning on deleting it, the only reason I haven’t is because the new update is almost universally hated so I’m holding out to see if they change it back. I’ll give it another couple weeks but I hardly use it anymore and neither do most of my friends.
I really enjoy Snapchat the app was great until the new update witch I feel crippled user friendly ness every time I try to view a story I end up hitting the username that sends me to the message area
You should really change it back. Everyone’s been trying to. I’m going to delete Snapchat. If I could give you a zero I would.
The new update is so bad
What a piece or trash, a once good app that seems to get worse and worse after every single update. Way to destroy your own app snapchat. Hope they put it back to how it was.
I think I will delete it
IF ITS NOT BROKE WHY “FIX” IT?! EVERYONE HATES THIS APP NOW & YOU NEED TO CHANGE IT BACK! YOU HAVE MADE IT WAY TO HARD TO DO BASIC TASKS , SO MUCH SO THAT IT ISNT EVEN WORTH THE EFFORT TO GET ON IT. I WILL BE DELETING. THANKS FOR NOTHING!(-:
The new update is terrible. Don’t think I’ll just forget it happened over time because I won’t. The app is so bad now and I have resorted to using Instagrams snap feature. You may be making some good money now off ads but ads mean nothing when you have no one using your app. Only using snapchat for my daily streaks now. Nice job team.
This past update is terrible. Would uninstall app if i didn't have a long streak. Bring back last version.
Change back to the old update
Does it function as it used to. I absolutely hate the update
i hate this update ! can y’all change it back . first off this update is to cluttery, second off it’s stupid . just change it back !
Terrible update absolutely terrible!!!
I don’t like that way new version because hard find event show video must on friend match  it too many mix junk show.  Please bring back old version.
Y'all just real bored I see. Because ya'll doing all this extra NONSENSE that's AINT NOBODY ASK FOR!! JUST STOP. TAKE IT BACK IT TO THE OLD SNAPCHAT! I WAS OKAY WITH THE NEW SNAPCHAT! UNTIL YALL UPLOADED THEM TABS! YALL MAKE MY LIFE HURT. YALL MAKE MY BUT HURT. YALL MAKE MY HEART HURT. I JUST HATE YALL. LIKE REAL SPILL.
If y’all do not make changes soon snap will be a thing of the past
Fire them. Literally fire them all.   What did you think? That you could get rid of a good UX flow to push that trending page and useless ads down our throats?   FIX THIS NOW. 
Y’all were supposed to fix what y’all did to snapchat not add more crap we didn’t want
I loved Snapchat until the update came out all my friends are deleting the app and I’m following in their path. Change it back to normal or everyone is going to end up deleting it.
Bad.
Why can’t snap just give us the old snapchat back, that would be a five star.
The only thing I truly hate about the new update is how you can’t see all of your friends stories in one area. They’re all jumbled in with ads and companies and such that I don’t follow or want to see.
You killed your self Snapchat
I loved snapchat until the most recent update, now I hate it. I don’t follow certain people because I clearly don’t care to see what is going on in their lives, now if I swipe left from my convos im at and “explore” type of page, leave that for ig ! Snap is supposed to be more private with who you decide to follow or not. I hate the way you have to navigate just to watch your story, hate the way my friend’s stories are laid out, literally hate everything about it. Please change this layout back to the old one we all loved !
New update won’t let you slide to preview messages.. more trash from the Snapchat team. No wonder your stock dropped so bad.
On my iPhone 6 snapchat is so laggy, I can’t even send a photo without getting boosted off. I see since the new update you have gotten a 1.8 in ratings... Anyways, you all need to fix this and go back to the old snapchat!! Thanks for listening, -qweenbork-
If I could give a a -star I would. I don't want adds. I just want to see my friends and few celebs I follow. Unnecessary update. I'll stick IG only now 🤷🏾‍♂️
Hate where the stories are on the bitmo face like now only 2-4 people see it instead of 60 and when u send a snap to a friend I don't like how they are charted
I’ve been snap chatting for a long time. And ever since the new update I haven’t been getting notifications
So I got the update and all but I’ve noticed other people changing the fonts of the text. I asked how people were doing it and they said it was the update. I took a picture and started typing and no font choices showed up. I tried logging out and uninstalling the app but it didn’t work. Please fix this because I wanna have cool fonts as well😂
Snapchat force updated my app and my automatic update is OFF! This update is corny! Please REVERSE the update!
Keep stories and snaps seperate please. This doesnt make it convenient this makes it confusing. Stop. Please. This is a mess of an interface
Snapchat, what’s going on ! I love you but the new update seriously has me second guessing. PUT IT BACK!
It would be a better app if I can get the quality my iPhone X can handle on the app for pictures 🤦🏻‍♂️
Puh puh puhlease don’t do this to us. Yo auto updated me. How dare you?!?! The new update is the worst thing I’ve ever seen before. Garbage
Snapchat used to be my favorite app, the one i'd make sure to never delete when clearing up space. But now, it's Instagram 😐. Snapchat is too jumbled together and it's really confusing and you have to actually search peoples names to find their stories or talk to them. There also isn't a my friends section anymore. I also can't tell what order the best friends list is in. Plus, the discover page is mixed with the stories ! Nooo ! My views have gone down by a huge jump, in which i don't even enjoy posting anymore. Please fix .
disappointing
Literally everyone is so done with the new Snapchat update. Change it Back. It’s garbage. And by the way. For an app that says 13+ there shouldn’t be so much sexual stories posted my Snapchat and news stories.
You guys updated it and it was trash and now you tried to update it again and it’s still trash. C’mon now
This is the best app out right now that update y’all came out with was A1 for real I bang with it heavy believe that .DONT CHANGE NOTHING EVERYBODY LOVES THE UPDATE keep doing y’all man #1 with it .
This update is terrible. My views went from 200+ to barely 100. The new setup is trash.
Every actualization keep making the app worst, go back to the original.
So the app automatically updated and this new update is garbage. Officially done with snapchat until I hear it's back to normal. Whoever develops this app literally made it more disorganized. Stories and news should be all together. Then Snaps and messages should be isolated.
Take away this update, yur ratings have dropped and I don’t know what’s taking yu so long to figure out the right thing to do
I was okay with the update until now I can’t swipe to read messages because I would just end up in the stories section. Please fix this so I can ignore some people sometimes and think about what to say beforehand. Some of you will understand. Thanks
I loved snap until the update🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
The new update is absolute trash and their response is even more tone deaf. I’ll be boycotting Snapchat until they reserve this pitiful update
I tried to get used to the new update. It is frustrating to add a friend I miss the old Snapchat. Try to get used to going to delete the app.
New update is terrible and my app keeps crashing every time I take a photo
New UI is garbage.
They need to change it back or I’m deleting.
I LoVE SNAP SNAP GANG!!!
The update is Shiite.
NO ONE WATCHES MY STORIES ANYMORE MAN COME ON CHANGE THIS BACK
I hit the delete button on Snapchat, I’ve had it for years but I’m not using it anymore.  This is really sad to me, because I’ll miss being able to snap my friends but I also am not willing to sift through their cancerous rearrangement. FB and IG stories can replace part of its function for people who are on either of those platforms, but the direct “snap” aspect is sadly not going to live on unless a competitor launches a similar app. 
Loved Snapchat but it's straight up TRASH with this update to use... trash as in the layout for it is absolutely not user friendly. I liked keeping my friends stories and who I interacted with on separate screens not together.
Just change it back
Snapchat was my go to social media, but then they decided to update it. I can no longer look at my friends stories, but I have to see some random people instead. Who, I have no interest in, i.e the Kardashians and some bear person. Did someone take a wrong turn with this concept design? Why can’t you guys do one thing right which is keep the old way and leave the discover to discover. I’m not really interested by the famous people you want me to watch, I wanna see what my friends are up to and not the whole world. Thought that’s what Snapchat is about, but naaah gotta take it to the extreme.
KYLIE KYLIEKYLIE KYLIEKYLIE KYLIEKYLIE KYLIEKYLIE KYLIEKYLIE KYLIEKYLIE KYLIEKYLIE KYLIEKYLIE KYLIEKYLIE KYLIEKYLIE KYLIEKYLIE KYLIE
They made the update the worst they made something simple and fun and turned it into complex and kinda annoying it was fine before that's not worst yet I didn't update mine it updated itself so kinda mad rn not gonna lie 😠
I absolutely love Snapchat, but I absolutely HATE THE TERRIBLE NEW DESIGN!! I want it changed back ASAP PLEASE!! This was a TERRIBLE IDEA!! NOO!!
👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
Y'all made it worse
The new update is awful! They need to revert it back to its original format! No one likes it and is stupid
I turned off my automaic updates just to avoid the new update, but somehow, my app updated itself to the new (garbage) format. This used to be one of my favorite social media apps, now it feels like they’re selling out to advertisers at the cost of accessibility. I would normally give this app four stars (can glitch at times) but now I would not recommend to anyone. Please go back to the old format, or make the app less cluttered and confusing!
The new update is horrible. Not user friendly and very confusing. I liked the old layout better. Change it back or Snapchat will have to be replaced with alternative options.
I Love snapchat but i barely use it after this new update it’s really stressful and BAD i wish that u would bring back the old version!   All love 
You put stories back on their own tab. Good, that’s what everyone wanted. But now it’s an extension of the “friends tab?!” So stories are exactly how they were before the dumb update, but now require extra steps to get to?!?! Why?! Just put it back how it was!! Everybody was fine with it, don’t keep messing stuff up!!!
It’s like you can’t even find snaps and then the messages are mixed up and it’s like you don’t wanna watch somebody’s snap by accident when you wanna text it’s like it’s just rushed and overcrowded and they should’ve just left it alone 🙄
Now
The update has completely ruined the app. I can no longer view my friends on a list alphabetically. There is no order. If I could give it 0 stars I would. Not using snapchat anymore
I like how you guys changed the conversation screen around but hate the layout of the stories page.
Snapchat was so awesome I used it everyday to talk to my bf but since the new update its complete garbage 🤷🏻‍♀️
Title speaks for itself. Will this company actually respond to its users and FIX the laughably bad update they released? Sadly, probably not. Thus this review was born!   Dear Snapchat, rollback this update. It’s simply terrible. From, the world. 
THIS UPDATE KEEPS ME FROM SNAPPING MY FRIENDS! It’s messy and confusing, and the stories section is way too confusing!
now when we swipe right in chats , it moves the whole stories around 😐
Update is bad, bring back the old snap
The layout before this update was tremendously better. Why fix something that isn't broken. Snapchat - listen to the masses and change the layout back to its glory.
Tf was y’all thinking
Snapchat is completely trash since the update. I don’t use it nearly as much anymore and barely look at stories smh
HATE HATE THE NEW UPDATE
Please bring back the stories page Snapchat! It is what made you unique! You all are caring more about the money than the customers but without the customers there will no longer be money...
The only reason I’m giving it 2 stars is because I’ve used this app for so long. I still absolutely cannot stand to even go on Snapchat. I DO. NOT. Care what order you ~think~ I want things in. I also DO NOT care in the slightest for the news stories page, it needs to go back to being stories. I’m so close to deleting because I hardly use it anymore. Just confused why you guys are not listening to your users, your rating is literally at 1.8. Smfh.
The last update has made this app just horrible. You should listen to the millions of people telling you to revert to the old app layout.
Newest issues I have are the new look is nice and all but finding people’s stories is a pain to do, I would like to have the old Snapchat back to the original way. Thank you. I really just want the old Snapchat back as soon as y’all read this thank you
I changed my rating to 1 star because of this horrible new update. Wake up and realize nobody likes it. Down to a 1.8 rating? Ouch. I’m to the point where I’m ready to discontinue use.
How can i get the old version of snap back please help‼️
This new update is even worse idk why you would even need two things for stories I can’t swipe to my chats and I’m used to that so it takes me to stories and idk why you guys are making it so un organized I can’t find anything so just make it go back you guys are really ruining Snapchat🤦🏽‍♂️
It looks like they assigned their best engineers to design the worst possible interface. In that, they were very successful.
Why did they make this update a thing? It’s so disappointing this used to be a great app. Shame.
They absolutely ruined this app. If I could give less than 1 Star I would.
Awful awful awful. I see four snaps of ppl I know. Anyone else I have to search them. So done with this app back to ig story times.
BRING BACK OLD UPDATE
Good app but it won’t load on my home screen so I have to search it up, click go to AppStore, then it will show Snapchat in AppStore, then click open to get in it.
Can you imagine if Twitter, or Instagram, or Facebook separated out all of the content by whether the person was famous or not?  😂😂😂😂😂I hope Snapchat loses billions on this change.
I doubt anyone will see this, but I figured “what the heck, I’ll give it a shot”.  First, let me just say, I just spent the last 15 minutes skimming through reviews. Literally 99.8% of them were people complaining about the new update. Second, let me just ask: WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!?! Y’all had the best app out there. I was constantly snapping, as were millions of other users. And yes, I’m sure many are still snapping because they don’t want to find something else or lose a streak, but for god sake! Bring the old Snapchat back! No one, I repeat, NO ONE likes this new update.  I know this is some big company but don’t forget that it’s the USERS who make it what it is. WE are the reason Snapchat became popular. WE are the reason Snapchat is what it is. Without the users, Snapchat is nothing but another app. So listen to the users, the people complaining, the people rating the app with 1 star (only because you can’t give 0 stars), and change it back. Please. 
This is by far the worst update i've seen from snapchat. From its humble beginning as simply a photo and chat social media has become a maze of paid channels and convoluted interfaces. The fact that there are now so many channels on the discover tab that they had to move my friends stories to my personal inbox is embarrassing. It shows that snapchat cares more about how much money they can get off channels than they do about the comfort and satisfaction of its customers. Snapchat is no longer "snapchat" to me anymore this app blows now.
What the heck is this new update ?!! It’s sooo horrible and hard to use. I don’t use to looove Snapchat. Now i don’t use it because i don’t know how to work it!!!
I was starting to like the new update while everyone else was complaining about it. Then you guys added something else to it. I don’t like how there’s a trash can now for the texts on pictures. I place my text right where the trash can is as a habit now and then i send my message and realize there’s nothing there. It’s kind of irritating. Yeah I know it’s not real world problems but yeah
Snapchat you were on cute little app.... SO I DONT SEE WHY YOU CHANGED EVERYTHING TO THIS UGLY FORMAT, GO BCK
My videos won't send, my Snapchat is slow and sad and disorganized. You made everyone sad. Change it back😉😉
I would normally rate this app 5 stars but after the update it can only get one. Awful update
Sorry but this current update is horrendous. Nobody cares about the discovery page, its way too cluttered, and its difficult to find my own story.
continuing on from my last review, I enjoyed having chats separate from stories and the ability to queue stories that you want to watch instead of having to individually mute stories of people whose stories you do not want to watch and having them mixed all around.
Used it daily before the new update. Terrible interface.
The new update is trash and I wish I had the option to keep the old version but the app always update back itself no matter what I do to switch back to the old one. 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
How it was in 2017 !!
You guys keep making shittier and shittier updates
I tried soooo hard not to update the app due to all the bad things I’ve been hearing about it and today as I log in it updated on its own!!!!!! It’s horrible I hate the new design. Guess I’ll have to stop using this and stick to Instagram.
The app is horrible now. On top of the layout being frustrated there’s a bunch of random strangers who I didn’t add that are famous and you tubers . If I wanted to see their page I would have added them and anytime I block them more pop up . Fix the layout back or expect to lose more subscribers
I used to be a super big fan of Snapchat..... but then they updated the app and changed everything! It gets really frustrating whenever the story and the messages are in the same place. When I'm trying to text someone, I have to scroll through endless stories to text them. This update is big inconvenience and needs to revert back to the update before this one.
Have used Snapchat for years and this new update has completely ruined the ease of use for the app. There are many ways to go about this and they did it totally wrong. If I’m not used to this within a week I will just delete Snapchat
Switch Snapchat to its original setting!!!!
It’s still trash, revert it back to the old one
Once again snapchat is proving that they care less about the people using the app and more about making money (or tanking their stock since they went public on Saturday? Suspicious). The new update moved snapchat in the WRONG direction making it even more annoying to use their dumb app by taking away the ability to swipe right on peoples names to send them a chat. Now we have to click the chat icon in the top right to send a chat to somebody. Keep it up and you will just end up being the next Vine on the App Store.  But yeah this is way more “easy to use and navigate”. Just as easy to use and navigate as escaping Tartarus.  Don’t forget, just as celebrities come and go with the years, somebody else always comes along to replace what’s old with something new. And maybe they will listen to what people are saying.
Why’s the update like this? Everything is cluttered and it makes me not want to use the app anymore :/
The only reason I’m still on Snapchat daily is because I’m hoping the update will be reversed. The story section is atrocious. I follow the people and stories that I choose for a reason. I don’t care about these “popular story” suggestions. It is also a hassle to rewatch a story since you now have to search for whoever you were looking for. Normally a 5 Star app but until the update, I will keep at 1 star.
it is extremely difficult to use. There are so many flaws in this that would have been avoided if they didnt do such a major software change. Not only is it difficult to use, but it because of how the friends are set up alphabetically instead of, you know, the logical way of having who you snapped with most recently. Also aestheticly it is extremely cluttered. there is no reason for everything to be so large and close together like how it is now.
If it was possible to give zero stars i would have 1 star is actually giving more credit than it deserves. I’ve decided to delete the app since the new update. It’s a bit much going back and forth watching snaps opposed to having them all together smh If it’s not broke don’t fix it !!
The new layout is cluttered and messy and actual trash. No one likes it..I love Snapchat but absolutely hate the new layout...
Seriously.
The new update - which many people I know absolutely hate - has finally hit my Snapchat and I really don’t like it. It’s not the worst thing ever, but it’s so much more complicated and confusing. I just want to be able to contact my friends. I’m actually kind of surprised that I avoided it this long, but it’s very annoying.
I didn’t think you could make it worse, but you did.
Don’t get Snapchat till they unupdate the app it’s bs with the new update
Change it back you whores
Deleted the app after the new update. The company has showed its true colors that it cares more about ad revenue than its users. C YA
Snapchat was my go to app previously. Now the App Store updated it, and I’m honestly considering deleting it for good. Do not get this unless they go back.
I love the new snapchat look, compared to the old one.
This update did help as it made a selection where u can see a full page of stories and nothing else as well as your group chats. What it failed to do was add a page where u can see only all your messages which I feel would be very helpful
Snapchat, honey, you’re so close to having something that actually works. Separate stories from my personal snaps. Come on. You’re better than this baby.
So I just updated my Snapchat. It is a little confusing. With everything that’s going on. I still would like to see were we can change our Snapchat name. Because we all know most of this generation made their Snapchat when they were in middle school. And we made some dumb decisions when we came to these names. And it could be like we can change it for free one time and then have to pay a few cents more and more each time we change out username. It’s just an idea. But i think with all the complaints you have been getting. And all the ones people have just talked about and not posted it on here should give y’all the idea to change some of the things back. There was really no need to make a HUGE change like that. 
Tbh I used to love it before the update but I’m getting used to the new update so idk. good app, though.
The new update is horrible! We want the old snap back
The new update was bad but I started to get used to it but the resent update is trash I love Snapchat but I don’t like the fact that you can’t preview the messages anymore if you try to slide it just goes to the story’s if you guys aren’t playing to go back to the old update that you had at least give us but the option to preview the message without having at actually open them.  I over the past week your review has been going down and I understand. While you guys are trying to make things better you guys are actually making them worse. I don’t mind the new update I like all the new features and stuff I just don’t like the way it’s set up. I don’t like that there’s a play for chat, story, and then group I hate it so much. Sometimes I want to text someone but I can’t find them because their chat went all the way to the bottom if you guys just keep all the new features like the different texts & the gif but just go back to the old version I’m sure you guys would get better reviews or at least allow us to preview messages again that’s the thing that is bothering me the most please do something about this!!
I love Snapchat but this update is absolutely terrible. Everything is messy and the app is so difficult to navigate, this makes me want to delete snapchat and start using Instagram stories instead. Please fix this. I don't know how anyone thought this was a good idea.
I’ve been using Snapchat for years and in the last couple years I’ve seen nothing but disappointing update after disappointing update. Two years ago a snap that made it onto my universities campus story could get almost 20,000 views. After they added all the ads and “news” stories that 20,000 dropped to about 1,500. Now after this repulsive update the campus story didn’t even get 200 views. It’s way to cluttered nor and is just gross to look at.
The new version of Snapchat is terrible, probably will start using Instagram instead
I love snapchat and use it everyday. But the new update makes me want to break my phone. It’s so cluttered and I can’t find anyone’s story anymore. On top of that, on the discover page, there are a bunch of random people that pop up that I don’t want to see. There’s a reason why I never followed those people before- because I don’t care about them and don’t want to see their stories! I want to see stories of my friends and family, not random people that gained popularity from vine or youtube. I keep losing streaks too because people who update their stories come up to the top of my friends list and my streaks fall so I don’t notice them. I have not met a single person that likes this update. Snapchat, seriously just change it back. This is horrible.
The new update is terrible
I blocked someone from seeing my story and they somehow saw it !!
snap chat just downgraded.. no one likes the updates snapchat, CHANGE IT!!
We want the old Snapchat back
Snapchat, you’re already way behind Facebook and Instagram in shares. I was supportive of you guys and I think most people still are but why can I not see my friends stories??? No one wants to be forced to watch stories from a bunch of influencers we don’t know. We want to see the stories of the people we know and added on Snapchat...that’s why we added them on Snapchat. I can only see the stories of people I have snapped recently and it’s extremely annoying. No wonder everyone is watching insta stories now. Go back to the way it was please.
It is a great app in all but whenever I have full bars of LTE it says I do not have any connection, but every other thing on my phone works.
this new update is by far the worst thing snapchat has ever done not a fan of snap anymore yall screwed this app
i don’t like how you guys manage to update my snapchat when my updates are off.
Really though, the update makes everything so confusing, sometimes I can’t even find who I’m subscribed to and re watch stories. It’s so dumb and useless, please fix this and change Snapchat to its original format.
The story’s being on the same page as your conversations is an absolute terrible idea. And a couple updates ago it changed so that if you accidentally swiped out of the chat the paragraphs you were texting to your gf disappears and it’s so stupid. Change those two things and it will be okay again
I loved it when all your subscriptions were at the top and you could swipe through rows but now it’s not like that please please please change it back
The Discovery stories are dumbing the nation with clickbait titles.  I had “automatic updates” turned off and still ended up with this new, horrible update design. No more Snapchat for me until you can revert it. 
I like the idea of the new look a LOT but it would be SOOOOOO much better if Snapchat put ALL the stories in one tab and then ONLY snaps on one tab... you feel??
Completely awful. I love snapchat & I used to use it all day, everyday. With this new update, it’s extremely difficult to find my friends stories. Once you’ve opened someone’s snapchat it’s almost as if it disappears into the MESS of the rest of the app. It Was a very organized and very user friendly VS with this update it’s terribly confusing and no where near user friendly. I’ve only heard bad reviews since it’s changed. It’s apparent by the number of 1 star ratings. I remember seeing this app with 4.5 stars, I hope it stays at 1 until some appropriate changes are made.
As an entrepreneur and business college student, it makes NO SENSE that you are keeping this update when literally EVERYONE hates it. I get it, you wanted to increase your revenue streams, and you wanted to please your investors... but when your value goes down 1.3 billion due to this and you say you’re still not changing it???? Are you serious??? I know SO many people that have completely deleted the app because they hate it so much. Y’all need to be careful or you’re going to lose your user base entirely and you’ll just be another one of those apps that came and went. BRING. BACK. THE. OLD. VERSION. Until then, I will be deleting it myself. ✌️
It just updated without my consent and I can no longer enter chats or send anything. Previously, swiping on or tapping on a conversation would open it. Now, thanks to this garbage update, swiping just starts filtering by group chats or something and tapping does nothing. Great way to kill your app with a single bad design decision. Next time listen to your QA team when they tell you your update doesn’t work.
h
Please bring the old snap back, this new update is very hard to understand. Thankyou 😘
PLEASE
Hey snap,  So I turned off automatic updates in early February because when you decided to change the format of your platform, ALL of my friends HATED it and I just wanted to avoid it. And that worked for a while. I had the nice version of Snapchat, when I woke up this morning I responded to my friends and everything was fine. BUT THEN, Y’ALL DECIDED TO UPDATE MY PHONE WITHOUT MY CONSENT AND NOW I AM STUCK WITH THIS NEW UPDATE THAT EVERYONE HATES AND I AM NOT OKAY WITH THAT. LITERALLY EVERYONE HATES IT. I did NOT update Snapchat so why do I have the update???????? I know y’all are happy that everyone hates the update and celebrities aren’t posting as much, BUT SERI

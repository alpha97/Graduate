Loving it so far This is such an awesome app. It appears we can only place one widget on it though. Unless I'm missing something. Right now I have the flash light widget. It's nice to have fast access to it. The only thing that could make this better is being able to set the wallpaper to something other then our home screen wallpaper. My lock screen was a modeling photo of my wife. My home screen is Cortana from Halo. My wife's photo is to busy to be a home screen but it would be great if I could use it as a lockscreen
Perfect Minimalist Lockscreen I've been using AcDisplay for a long time now. It handles notifications simply and smoothly, right out of the box, but now has plenty of customization options available (esp. custom widgets) The only problem I've encountered so far is the occasional non-responsive media controls, but I'm sure they'll be fixed soon. Thanks, dev!
Brilliant app!! Edit: 'Had to uninstall. Started taking too much resources/battery in the background I don't know, if it's a bug or anything. Kindly fix it.' Really cool. It's a no nonsense app. Please do rem though this app keeps on running in the background and though it's not really a super heavy app but it's not feather weight either. It is perfectly fine by me, coz I find it to be totally worth it. It gives you a buttery smooth experience and the lock screen looks wise is damn cool. Love it. Thank you so much!!
Love the app, however, there are a few bugs. I noticed that whenever I press my physical home button, it automatically unlocks my phone. Not sure if that was done on purpose though. Also, when I press my recent apps button, it takes me to my recent apps, which I don't think should even happen. It would be nice to add an option to set a custom wallpaper for the lockscreen as well as enable pattern and passcode lock. Other than that, I really like how simple and straightforward this lockscreen is.
1. WHEN USING LOCK SCREEN FUNCTION WITH PASSWORD CAMERA WILL NOT OPEN. If you want to use the AcDisplay lock screen and a pin, you simply enable AcDisplay on top of your stock lock screen. However, when opening camera from an off display using volume button shortcuts, AcDisplay will be in your way. Also, when using the AcDisplay camera shortcut, you will have to enter your pin before being able to use the camera (versus being able to use camera from the lock screen with the stock lock screen). 2. PHONES WITH FINGER SCANNERS MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY. Many phones such as the Honor 5x, Honor 8, Nexus 5x, and Nexus 6p have a fingerprint scanner that allows you to go from an off display directly to the home screen when your finger is scanned. You cannot do this with AcDisplay, as the AcDisplay lock screen will open up every time your phone is unlocked.
Lovely app but... This app has such great potential I hope the developer isn't dumping it. Apps like "Glance Plus" is taking over but aesthetically can't compare to this, functionality wise the former has unique options like direct unlock with finger print, auto disable when call alert, the gesture wake seems more sensitive too. Would be great to see features like these on ACdisplay cos this app is well written. I think a lot of people don't mind paying for good written apps.
Great so far. The lock screen is so beautifully simplistic and so far it's been working great. Only one issue: I have the app set to stay enabled even when there are no notifications, but every so often I'll wake the phone screen and it just gets right into my phone. The lock screen isn't there. So just that one issue. Something I'd really like to see is the ability to set some sort of security to the lock screen, whether it's a password, pin number, or pattern.
I totally love it but... Everything is so subtle and clean. Just one thing, make it more stable for music player. In an instance, I was playing music and in the first time I looked at the screen I saw the toggles of musixmatch player and a blur of the artwork as the background. That was great but I turned the screen of and I turn it back on and everything was back to the clock and the phone's wallpaper. Please fix this because this is one of the best apps. This fix could mean so much. Thank you and I hope you will respond.
Good but flawed The minimalistic design is very pleasing and I really like the functionality. There is one issue: I have a phone where most of the time I use the fingerprint to unlock. Because this needs system administrator privelages, often I will click and my phone will tell me that because of Android security policy I need to enter my pin, and not use fingerprint. Also, it would be simpler if you could set a fingerprint within the lock screen instead of having to clock again to your normal lock screen to unlock.
Lockscreen is beautiful! You may call it a beta but if set up right this can be an amazing lockscreen! I have this setup in 3 of my devices! All look stunning! A hat tip to you my friend! SUGGESTIONS: Allow the widget to be centered on the lock screen, currently it's kind of 70% vertical. Allow making the background blurred or frosted rather than darker. I will happily donate to you!
Amazing but little buggy The best one have used. Simple. But not so smooth now. If there is a carrier notification on home screen and if its not removed and screen is turned off and then on again. the app responds abnormally making the ac display lock screen blink continuously. Also if we are able to choose custom background instead of black or homescreen,it would be great! Down rated..fix the bug. would love to rate 5 stars then.
Waving your hand across the screen does not open the app. I have tried it several times on my Galaxy Note 5 with no luck. That's one option that I had loved about the Moto X was their active screen. You could just wave your hand across the screen and the time, date and any messages would appear on the screen. I thought that that is was this app was suppose to do, but I can't seem to get it to work.
Hi, i love this app it's so elegant and simple yet good aesthetic. The only problem is that for devices like mine which has fingerprint sensors. Their compatability is too far from acceptable i think it's due to the security policy. The case being that you can't use it together with the fingerprint and the users will also want to keep a lock on a phone for security and we can't use the app in sync with it
I love this app, such a unique lockscreen from everything else. Rating 4 stars as I have 1 suggestion that I think needs addressing - when I receive a call and don't pickup, the phone remains on the home screen and doesn't lock itself. It's quite annoying when it is in my pocket. Other than that, its a great app. Well done developers.
Works as expexted, but doesnt solve Android issue This is a great small and free app, but it doesn't solve underlying problem with Android Lollipop 5.0.2 screen lock. I've searched for some app to show small and compact notifications after upgrade from Kitkat 4.4.4 to Lollipop 5.0.2 on my Sony Xperia Z3 compact. Despite this beauty works smooth, it only makes things worse: to unlock a mobile I need to make FOUR actions: press power button, swipe AcDisplay screen, swipe my unlock pattern. This is just ridiculous!
Fantastic App This app is fantastic regardless! I would love some features like lock screen options, etc. But either way you did a great job. I was using Nils previously and stopped and really didn't find another one I liked until now but I have to try it out and see how it worked in my everyday use.
Awesome lockscreen I usually dont like "defacing" the stock look of my G4, but i made and exception for this app. I hope the devs read this, because i have a few requests. The app sometimes puts my phone to sleep for no reason. The wave to wake option is sweet, but only works 1/10 times and my hand needs to be really close to the sensor. Other than that, the notifications on the lockscreen are baller, and the active mode is pretty cool as well and works most of the time.
No updates! This app definitely has potential! but there's no consistent development. I really enjoy this app for the most part, but you can tell there are bugs that need to be addressed. Why not update your app and turn it into a real money maker! I would pay if this app was keep updated.. Just so you know, thanks
Great app just needs a few additions This is a fantastic app for someone coming from the Motorola ecosystem that misses the active display as badly as I did. There needs to be a way to swipe the media player out of the way to access the normal acdisplay screen. There also needs to be an addition that brings up acdisplay when the phone is picked up after sitting for a set period of time. I have issues with the proximity wake but pulling it out of my pocket always seems to work. Otherwise this is a fantastic app!
Little bug When i was unlocking my phone, sometimes it has delay and after 1 to 2 seconds the lockscreen will appear. And when someones calling, i need to unlock 1st before i can see whos calling. Its nice and clean but need passcode. I'll give 5 star for this lockscreen because in my opinion this is the best. But it lacks feature. If you can release a paid version app, I'm willing to buy this lockscreen.
The s7 Edge is the second device I've had ACdisplay as my main lock screen. Only issue I've come across is recently, when I have a notification and I click the icon, it won't give me any information of the notification in place of the widget anymore. If somebody can tell me what to do to sort that out, I'll rate 5 stars. As of now, it's the only nice looking lock screen worth having.
Almost perfect 1) The following feature is called active display, it was integrated first into a Nokia 909, later introduced into a few Lumia Whidows Phone devices. 2) On windows phones (that the following feature was available on), it was labelled as "Glance screen" and it was separate from the lock screen 3) Glance is essentially an extra layer over the current screen lock layer. 4) I tried most of the alternative apps, yet I come back to this one all the time 5) GET IT NOW!
THIS IS THE PERFECT ONE! Now it only misses one thing: a security. After all, it's a lock screen, so it is pretty ironic for a lock screen to not have a security. Also hopefully more customizable, like being able to change your wallpaper. Also the notification bar shouldn't be able to go down while in the lockscreen. Those are my suggestions.
Glance plus app (Why its better?) I don't want to use glance plus instead of ac display because acd, it's really beautiful! But I have to use glance plus because of two features: Customisable Analog Clock & Calender (both at different times can be added to lock screen). I don't want to use glance plus. Ac display team please, do something. Thanks. Waiting for your update, acd!
It's the best I was looking for a lockscreen without any flashy wallpaper or a lot of shortcuts, I mean when I will need an app I'll just open it, there is no need for it to be on my lockscreen. The thing I liked the most about this lockscreen is the way the notifications dissolve when pushed down. The solid color lock and the backgrounds are awesome,I keep them in random order. This lockscreen is The best for the users who love to be simple.
Perfect I always wanted something like this but I wasn't able to find however I think now I have with you AC Display. Now I am so much used to it that it is hard to get away not to use it. This is a feature that every phone should have. But no problem all of us have Android devices and therefore No Problem.
Probably the best ever lock screen app in my view. It's very simple and good looking, and works also great. Although it says the lockscreen feature is in beta and may not stable. But it's enough stable for me and works well. The very minimal look and unlock animation makes it different from other apps. But there no password or pattern protection is available in it. Please add some protection and the app will be PERFECT..
Battery drain I like it. Nice to be able to see at a glance notifications and I love the simplicity. I just wish there was the ability to leave the screen on longer (until I dismiss, 1 hour, etc), maybe contact photos for notifications, proximity sensors, and shortcuts on lock screen. Also, it seems to not play well with Textra. When I get a text message, it will flash the screen on, then turn off and on until I open the notification. I have tried changing the priorities and all other options.
Love it..one question? Crashes from time to time..Battery drain and ram incresed Love the app, I can see all my notifications very quickly in a bubble and close them and it leaves it as unread and keeps me a reminder to open them again later , love the background blur and photo of the person.but the battery drain and RAM usage incresed and you remove the notification of the slide bar? If yes would be happy to rate it a 5 star
Great features but please work on supporting 'smart lock' of samsung When i get home, the smart lock keeps my screen unlocked meaning i dont need to type in a password to unlock it, but with Ac Display set as lock screen, i always have to unlock the phone with a password every time i turn it on.. please fix (: -edit: nevermind i dont have to retype my password but i have to swipe a second time, however if i dont have a password set, then i dont need to swipe twice, i need a password on it tho
Amazing, Absolutely Awesome, Love it This app is absolutely, mind-blowingly and bogglingly, beautifully, totally and amazingly completely AWESOME!!! I have been looking for a lockscreen for so long that I almost gave up, but then along came AcDisplay. There is absolutely not one thing I would change in this app, that's how beautiful it is. No mistakes, nothing, none, nada, zilch. *App you're amazing, just the way you are* Hats off to the devs, great work, keep it up!!!💓💗💓💗💓💗
Love it, but.. I used this lock screen for a very long time and loved it, but I had to stop using it because there was a bug with it that would disable/shut off my alarms immediately as they were starting. This, in turn made me late for work on several occasions. If that one bug would or could have been fixed... 5 stars, best lock screen ever.
Perfect! Perfect!! Perfect!!! Nearly rooted my android and then I found this. Perfect in every way. Does everything I wanted for a lockscreen. Loving the minimalistic design too. Pure winner. I'm only nitpicking here when I say my only problem is with the tiny time notice at the top when you click on a notification. I wish there was a setting to turn that off. It's still the best piece of app I have encountered in a long while.
I love the app, it works smooth on my s7 and helps a lot with notifications. The only issue i have is when I try to unlock my phone, it opens the ac display, then after I swipe it goes to my lock screen before ac, and tells me I can't use my fingerprint to unlock my phone. I don't know why but if that gets fixed it is definitely a 5 star app.
Almost! Great minimalist lock screen. The wave proximity sensor unlocking function should be improved though. As well as adding more options for swiping from upper/lower right/left, not just dialer and camera. And it would also be perfect if you can edit the size of the clock. Hihi. Still an awesome app though! :)
Home Button The app is nice. I enjoy the sleek look it brings to the table; a nice change of scenery from the stock lock screen. however, it's a little irksome to me that the screen unlocks just by pressing my home button while the display is on. I also seldom experience an issue with the screen display coming back on just after dimming once a notification has been shown and no action taken. any way to fix these issues? Then you're golden!
Hi. I really like this lock screen. the feature where you can set the lock screen background as your home screen background. It even world with live wallpapers! I have not yet figured out how to add a pin, password or pattern so one of these would be nice (preferably pattern). Thank you and keep up the good work.😀😁😃😄
Hey, mate! Nice work! Really love the concept and design. I'm searching some good lockscreen app and then found this one, immediately love it! I have a small favor though, could you please add some security options to the lockscreen feature? I know it's not actually a lockscreen app, but if you could that would be great. If you do, I'll give it 5 stars.
Could had been 5 stars I would had rated this 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I can't put in a custom widget (which was probably the main reason why I was excited for this app). I was able to have it actually work once, but it was also the last. It could had been better if it had its own passcode options. It's such a disappointment that I don't see any solutions yet.
It's doesn't work what so ever. I'll have to lock screen enabled yet when there is a notification, it will just unlock my phone instead of showing the lock screen. So instead of showing me notifications it unlocks my phone while in my pocket and ends up opening all my apps because my phone is unlocked. Even when I tap the home button or the lock button it just unlocks my phone. It looks nice, but I can't use this anymore without wanting to smashing my phone

I only buy the game for MyCareer Mode and you made it "vague" for lack of a better term. I like the no simulation  rule but miss the Billboards, Speaking w/ GM, Consistent Stats and being able to take trade request at the end of the season. It's not right.
This game is amazing and fun, the career mode is my favorite! This game can be frustrating sometimes, but other than that is awesome! Hope there will be a new update soon, know it will take a while and people this game might want to be played on console, just saying, and I love you 2K!!!!!!!$$$$$
This is game is really good. I love all the different t things you can do. But I mostly play my career mode. I would really love to see a head to head game, like online.
Thank you!  Update made game 5 Star worthy now. Thanks for putting spectator mode back in as well. Excellent graphics and player motions for a smartphone game. One last thing though- Will you please update the commentary from announcers. You have it still talking about coach Pop being fined two years ago for resting Key players...🤔.  Come on guys! It’s 2k’18’. Update the game fully, and will you please update the rosters. The trade deadline has come and gone and you still have the same lineups. Come on y’all!! Update!
It’s a satisfying game but the only thing is it won’t let me make a free Throw shot!! 
This game is horrible you can’t even play my career mode because it crashes every time
PLEASE FIX THE BUGS PLEASE ITS RIDICULOUS MYCAREER CRASHES WHEN I TRY TO PLAY IT
Won't download
Edit: nice update, fixed all frame rate issues. Thank you 2k!! We finally have an enjoyable association mode with trade logics, draft, scouting, contract negotiation and more. I can’t thank you enough. I didn’t see much of an improvement as far as controls. There is still room for improvement there
Where is the update....? Really
Please update to optimize screen for iPhone X literally only complaint game runs so smooth and plays and looks amazing
I love this game but would love to see while I can play on my moga please do your best to make that happen
More Gameplay Should Is My Only Complaint Should Be Able To Play In Park With Other People
When you will update the rosters? Cavaliers changed all their rosters close to 50% if theirs rosters, updates please. 
It takes A MINUTE for a single page to load and every page is the same whether it’s choosing a jersey or just pressing into my career mode. On top of that the gameplay is also sub par because there is only one way to play and win, any other gameplay style will result in a terrible loss. Shooting threes only work if youre wide open or steph curry. Another problem is the character making is pretty bad you can see the difference between any character you make and the default players already there. Even the default my players are worse than any character that is a real life player. Id say it was rated 1.5 but i cant do that. So get gud game makers its 2018
Tenía Nba 2k17 y en cuanto estreno nba 2K18 lo compre y empecé a jugar.me encantaba por su sistema de juego y gráficos pero lo dejé de usar porque las plantillas de los equipos no se actualizan.Todavia en febrero 2018 tiene las plantillas de octubre 2017.Yo no deseo jugar un juego con equipos que tienen jugadores en equipos incorrectos.
When I play my career we are up three with 15 seconds and I get subbed out the we lose 98-92. The original score was 64-61. Fix your game 2K!!
My player misses at least 8 wide open green releases a game and is always having part of his teammate grade taken away whenever any player on the other team scores. Also I was selected to the three point contest and the dunk contest but couldn’t play them. Third, every time I throw a pass to my teammate it throws an alley-opp from across the floor which ends up a turnover. And I never get foul calls. My guy gets thrown to the ground and no foul but I lose the ball and it ends up a turnover. I can’t wait to finally get the game for the Xbox because the mobile version is straight garbage.
But can you put Nate Robinson on one of the teams he played for it would be really cool and maybe have another update it’s a nice game but maybe you can put Nate the great in nba 2K18 thanks
I love this game. I played through an entire myCareer season to get to the playoffs which took at least a month. I win the first round in five games, then no more games appear on the calendar in the myCareer menu. So all of that time was put in for absolutely nothing. I’m so mad right now...
Amazing game but update the rosters ever time a trade happens that’s all i ask for no need for injury free rosters
Why is the green bar even present in the game. When the full green bar pops up the shot doesn’t even go in so what’s the purpose. Also there are some dumb animations that cause turnovers.
Ok so when I got this game I made my dude a sharpshooter. And I was nailing threes and it was barely upgraded. So I was like when I upgrade Ima become a god, but no i spent 10 dollars and my dude got way worse when I upgraded his threes he can make a single three on the left side of the court and I can miss easy open A+ quality, I want my money back. Also my phone catches on fire and I can't finish a game because I have to take a break cause my phone is so hot and I have an I phone 7
Put the updated rosters
First of all this is definitely the best sports game on the App Store. I love the new association mode and better graphics, but there are some issues. My first complaint is the stats glitch. I had to completely delete my 90 overall player because the stats were all messed up and it wouldn’t count games. I played 20 games and we were 2-0 and I was averaging 0 in every stat category even though I scored. Second of all, it would be nice if there was more customization. The only thing you can really customize is your myplayer. Also, it would be nice if you could choose spectate from the beginning when playing a quick game instead of having to go into it an hit pause. Lastly, the salary cap in association mode is broken. It says I can’t sign a player for over 400k when I have 5 players on my team. If these things were addressed this game would be better.
This game is pretty awesome! Great graphics. But, there’s a few things I wish were on here. 1. I wish there was a career mode for WNBA. 2. I wish there was an updated version for looks on the player. But other than that, I love it!
Fix the roster fix the teammate grade fix how turnovers work fix the teammates in my Career and also in my career I have maxed out shooting and Gereice and I’m a play maker for some reason I’m shooting 25% from the three and 40% from the field so definitely fix that and last but not least whenever I’m posting somebody else I spin I’m gonna lose the ball and also when I do use the ball is in his turn over me when the ball goes out of bounds because the poked  it but the poked it
The replays have just stopped working for me I’m not sure if it’s because I haven’t made any plays or anything but the game is just kinda Bugged 
Certain additions such as the statement edition jerseys would be a great addition.  Historical teams as in the console versions should be considered as well 
Update the rosters & fix the glitches in association mode
I love everything but I'd like to see a better controller like 2k16 version but more refined for use. Like the console feel for chaining dribble moves and what not. Also, add the shot creator! That was my favorite feature in these last few years.
This games controls are complicated, and unlike other 2k mobile games they feel weird. Not only that but the graphics haven’t changed and the mycareer is still the same old boring thing. Change it up!
Great game, however: In Career Mode, when we select or try on equipment from the 2K store (shoes, leg sleeves, arm bands), you should make it so that the color of the selected gear would automatically change to match our player’s team’s colors. If not, at least give us the option to change the equipment’s color as we see fit. It looks weird for my player to have on orange striped purple leg sleeves (+3 agility) with his red, yellow and black uniform Miami Heat uniform.
It takes a lot of space, it would be awesome if you can actually hear your music while you play it. Does this game really have to take all of the space?
I can do any game mode except when I go to play a game in MyPlayer it crashes as soon as I go to play.  Tried uninstalling and re installing and still does the same.
Why can’t you intentional foul in this game?! I’ve lost many games in the end because I couldn’t foul in time. I had to reach and hope for a foul. If I’m missing the intentional foul button please let me know. Also when I call for a pass I’m wide open no help defense and no second help and I get a bad grade for it.
Roster updates should be updated at least a week after anything happens in the NBA, it tiring having to make your own roster changes
First up I am obsessed with 2k on mobile and console. I love the association or franchise mode most. But there are a couple of problems. Now I am about to get specific. First up why is Lebron 99 overall, so overated. Secound why is Isaiah Thomas 82 overall while people like Averie bradly are like 83. Finally why is Lonzo and Tatum like 80 when they should be like 84. Now let’s talk about 2k problems. First up why is it when you hit a A plus shot on mobile you miss it. IT IS SO annoying. Second why is it when you play 2k on mobile or console your my career player starts at 55 overAll, it is really hard to even get them to 75 overall. Last this mobile game should be a max of 3.99 not 6.99. I would just like to say I would not recommend this game unless u do not have a console. The console version is a LOT better.
Great game but would like an update to support the iPhone X display.....
The rest of the game is great especially with the all-time greats mode. However, mycareer always says it’s preparing for game before the game crashes.
It is a amazing game.  My favorite by far but i want to see some changes.  It wont let me go through more than one season.  I cant go farther than one season.  Also point guards should be able to dunk.  Otherwise great game.  Please fix the problems.
My only complaint is that there’s no online game mode, that would be extremely fun.
The controllers are too big and too small which effects the way I play (on iPhone 7)  :( also please add statement jerseys. The standings and stats also freeze as it makes it harder to know your own progress in MyCareer. Also can you allow us to edit our team’s minutes and trades in MyCareer. Until then i will continue to enjoy the game a bit. We love it when you guys are consistent with the roster updates please continue to do so! 2 stars till then. :/
Great game love it for what it worth. It is a mobile game so I get a lot of stuff that is or isn’t. But Jamal Murray of the Denver Nuggets looks like a created player, when on 2k17 he looked like Jamal Murray. Lol Idk if there’s others players like that but I know for sure about him. Lol cool to fix cool if not. Great game! Ronnie!! You a monster.
I love this game, but I think it could use a multiplayer setting so i could play against my dad on separate iPads. The Association mode gets me every time too, because even when I’m able to force a trade, there is still the salary cap.
Can you please update the rosters wth the trades and also add the city jersey in the game
It’s a great game overall,BUT after I started my 3rd season the game keeps crashing after I try to play the last game of the season. And my career is the only mode that happens in. I’ve tried re-installing the app but nothing works. I’m getting quite upset considering all the time and yes even some money I’ve spent
Please optimize for iPhone X
I am needing some help in Career mode I have past the first playoff games but it will not allow me to go to the second round. Its kind of frustrating.  Please help fix this for me.   Also this game rocks, its lots of fun sports wise for a phone the graphics are unreal. 
This game should update the teams’ rosters for the 2018 Season.
Yes the game was awesome but i’m still waiting for nba all star update team lebron and team steph where is it?
Love nba 2k on my ps but i can’t take it with me wherever I go so this is the next best thing
Optimize for iPhone 10!!!!! It would make the game so much better for iPhone X users!!
The graphics look like something from the old days
Im stuck at the 2nd round of playoffs, I swept the 1st round and now I cant seem to continue
This game is absolutely horrible! First off even if you get a green release you can still miss it or even air ball it😡😡 secondly, dirk is on the cavs and they keep calling Kevin Durant, Kevin love and giannis Kobe etc. do not buy unless you want to rage
It won't lit me download the game. Every time I try is says unable to download, try another time
I clicked on the app and then is said unable to log in so it restarted everything
I thought the game was gonna be dope until I found out it doesn’t work on iPad trash 2k trash p.s. I waited 3 hours to install🖕
The game is awesome but when I’m in quick game or career the announcers aren’t always talking or they say the wrong names of the players and Doris Burks is gone she doesn’t even talk anymore so if u could fix those problems that would be great
The Game is amazing BUT EVERY TIME I GET AN “A+” It misses It’s so annoying please fix this :) Then I will buy every 2K Product that is basketball. 
2k is the best game in the world i hope their will be a 2k19 so when it comes out I’m gonna play it.
This game is great and all but In “my career” in every half the scores gets higher and makes you loose on command.
Want to like it but it's absolutely unplayable. I have a iPhone 7 and this just would not work at all. Kept crashing when I tired to enter a game. Would like money back.
Great game.. Fix the lags and add an online mode to play against other players
Plz 2K update for the IPhone X
Gameplay is great, but My Career has some bugs that ruin the experience. Halfway through the season, the game stops logging stats- I just hit the all star break, and my team has had the same record for weeks. Also, there should be more in depth stat sorting - how hard would it be to have a league leaders page?
When will this next update comes ?
Okay I’ve played 2k14/2k15/2K16/2k17&2k18 and would have to say that 2K18 is a much better updated version. But I would say that their are some bug fixes that could be changed.
I bought this game and I cant even type and THIS GAME SO CHEESY I get foul ever time I play the computer and the computer make everything for deep and at end of game I alway get foul and I cant even do my career
Only thing that I don’t like is that I can’t sign my players on the association. It’s really annoying to lose your players after every season. And please update the new nba roster. 
I like playing my career but mostly every time I play it’s lags so hard so everything is messed up like my shooting and my defense and I think it’s my phone but my every time I go to the home screen it’s normal so fix ASAP and how the freak does my 86 overall guy miss a perfect shot fix shooting too
The graphics are a little bit poor I think it's retarded that the game is 4.99 why not nothing.
Been playing 2K since 2K13 on the Xbox and mobile. This game is great, mycareer is just like nba 2k16 mycareer except without the cutscene’s. The only thing I have a problem with is the administration mode. I can’t re-sign players, get players in free agency. Nothin, so it is a little bit irritating. But other than that I still get that 2K feel.. other than missing green lights. Every one said they wanted the game to be realistic. So don’t complain about averaging 40% from 3 and 60% FG... that’s better than any NBA player has done to keep that going. It’s a video game that everyone said they wanted a bit more realistic... I will change it to 5 stars when you fix the green light issue and the administration issue. Other than that another 2k game I will play till the next comes out
I love the game, it’s really fun I play it all the time. You probably read this all the time about the bad call for pass, it’s annoying and you guys should fix it. Also you guys gotta add more jerseys, like the t-shirt jerseys! In MyCareer you should be able to wear arm/leg sleeves, headbands, under-jersey t-shirts like Antony Davis, and make it custom so your player can wear anything that usual basketball players wear, they don’t even have to add any attributes to you’re player they should be there for show. Also the equipment you can buy with Vc should match the uniform of the team you’re playing for, like if I’m on the Lakers and I have bright blue shoes on it looks dumb, they should match the uniform. All around the game is great but these little add ons would make the game way more enjoyable.
Please add the shoe creator and the dunk and three point contest
It my player retire without letting me finish my career and I’m playing the Association mod and it crashes every single time every time I get on the association it just crashes the app😤😤😤😤
My app keep closing out by itself before I have a chance to start my next career game and the bug is not fix because the app also be glitching throughout the 2nd half
I knocked the ball lose from someone then clicked sprint to grab it and I was holding sprint and once I picked the ball up my guy shot it because the sprint button for defense is in the same spot as the shoot button and once it switched to offensive controls he shot it. Thanks for your time. Great game though
Game won’t save roster and lineup changes made.
Please update the roster and get back the Euro league so that we can play with Ball brother’s 😍
It’s a really good game but I can’t dunk on my phone and I’ve been trying for weeks
Good game but you guys need to update the teams like pistons Miami heat lakers also more thanks I enjoy this game a lot
the new control buttons is not good as the 2k16.Please give us back
I am tired of missing greens and not being able to call a timeout
The roster are wrong some of the players got traded to a different team and there still on the team they were on before
Update the rosters
When is there going to be an Update for the game or adding an “Update Rosters” button please and thank you
This game should be free.... not good
Game crashes constantly. I can’t count how many times I have had to delete and reinstall just to be able to play the game again.  Of course 2K does nothing to fix the issue.
After crashing and losing a lot of my stuff the developers updated the game and I love it now. All I’m waiting for is the trade deadline roster update.
Can you guys update the teams and the players and the courts
You're stupid game didn't let me even download it. So I deleted it and I didn't get the 8 dollars back that I spent on it!
Like you guys have the same three uniforms for every team like. Let’s us have more choices when it come to the uniforms from classic uniforms to the current one
Update
I spent eight dollars on this game and I  get a game that doesn’t even save I play game scored 49 points game crashes and in the middle of a game 35 points and only in the third quarter game crashes i play the same game over and over and all it does is crash I love 2K18 but right now it just makes me want to play NBA live
The fact that I can’t box out makes getting put back postered not so fun and it also makes playing a big man of any kind mostly useless since rebounds are 90% ridiculously long since any missed jump shot means that’s a rebound in the mid range area and your rebound animations make your player look like a clumsy child who can’t simply jump high enough or grab the ball I got small guards doing better than my glass cleaning center and since I can’t box out short easy rebounds are getting me dunked on
I’ve scored over 70 points twice however my highest career points has not change from my last record. Game has tons of bugs and glitches and tends to shut down in the 4th quarter.
This game is like 2k18 on Xbox. The graphic are amazing and the controls are perfect. I had a fun time playing this game.
I wanna see a roster update after the trade deadline plz 2K. It’s a good game I enjoy it a lot I would just like you guys to update the roster. And have the same interface as 2K18 for consoles
This game is full of bugs I bought it on Christmas and haven’t been able to play more then once in any game mode and it shutdowns and goes back to my home screen updates and still can plan wish I could get a refund do not buy
Makes phone Hot and Kills Battery percentage. Everything else is good.
BRO EVER SINGLE TIME I TRY TO SAVE GUESS WHAT HAPPENS I DOESNT EVEN SAVE AND CAN YOU GUYS PLEASE RESTART MY GAME SO I CAN MAKE EVER THING NEW PLEASE!!! RESTART EVER SINGLE THING ON MY APP PLEASE CUS IT NEEVVER SAVES!!!!!!!!!!!MY SAVE ALWAYS SAY NO INTERNET SIGNAL BUT MY INTERNET IS LIKE THE BEST!
This a great game. What would make the game even better would to have new updated rosters after the past NBA trade deadline just without the injuries to some players. And have some free fixes in mycareer where sometimes gear may glitch. And I think it would be cool to play blacktop games with free agents and just let them play in the ballers and ringerz jerseys since they aren’t on a nba team
CANT RESIGN OWN PLAYERS IN ASSOCIATION  TEAM RECORD GETS FROZEN AND DOESNT UPDATE. SO YOU HAVE NO IDEA IF YOU WILL MAKE A PLAYOFFS. I WAS 5-14 till end of the season. SAME FOR OTHER TEAMS  HAVE TO SCROLL TO THE VERY END TO FIND NEW FREE AGENTS   FAKE FACES FOR GOOD IMPORTANT PLAYERS.   PLAYER NAMES ARE MATCHED WRONG - they say players on another team completely.    CANT RUN ANY PLAYS YOURSELF  Buddy hield, jonathan simmons is a top 100 players. Tons of other players at least 20-30 have fake faces. Please fix at least top players. 
Had MAJOR issues with it crashing in the beginning. Since has been resolved. Very satisfied with the game at this point now that it is working. Wish they’d update the rosters just maybe 1 or 2 more times. Doesn’t seem like it would be too hard to do, and it would significantly improve the game in my opinion.
Slight upgrade from 2K17, but the same issues ported over.   1. Shoulder and elbow sleeves still appear torn. NO is not my device. Running an 8plus 2. Doris Burke says nothing beside “I was able to speak to the coach and he said”.....silence  3. For some reason the commentators are looking forward to seeing Metta world peace every laker game ??? 
I’m playing my career, the game lags so hard it’s unbearable. And I swear they put no effort into consistently updating this game and fixing the many bugs it has. Also passing is screwed up in this game I want to pass to this but I end up passing somewhere else it’s dumb.
Man, where do I even start. Don’t buy the game unless you have money to spare for something that is worse than a free game.  Legit the offense and defense in this game is absolute trash. You can’t dribble past anyone unless your playmaking and agility is maxed out but that’s too bad also since you get double teamed every time you score 3 points! The game is just 1v5 every time and it’s annoying as hell. You would think isolation would help but no the whole enemy team still teams you. Every single shot is also contested since screens just grabs you another double team while every green A+ shot misses. I have a maxed out 99 3pt shooting and I still average 30-45% each game with 50-60% field goals. You can’t even get to 99 ovr either, or at least for me it is (92 ovr). Honestly though fix dribbling and please for he love of god fix the biggest thing in the game. You losing the ball because of some retarded spin move which basically stubs you then you drop he ball. There are also times eh e if you even touch them they strip you of the ball before you even can try and lay it in. It’s literally so cheesy. 
Keeps erasing my save points and is hard to handle when you don’t have the perfect connection. Also fouls are sometimes not called and you can be shoved or fouled and its counted as if it’s a turnover. Lost of fixes needed.
I maneuver and finagle for a couple seasons to get some great players through the draft.  After a couple years they just disappear.  No opportunity to sign, just gone.   Fix the contract stuff and this is 5 stars because I love the rest of the game.
This is one of the better basketball games this century
I have the iPhone X it would be nice if this game was compatible also roster update the entire Cavs team is different lol
Who I bought this game? Play 2K18 for real thought mobile would be fun but NOOO. This game is trash. Mycareer is terrible, it gives you a rating but doesn’t understand that no ever is a pro gamer or even a nba player like it punishes you for requested to get pass, like ITS MYCAREER I WANT TO SCORE ITS WHY I BOUGHT THE GAME! Also just things like you don’t drive if someone if within a 5 foot radius of you, you character moves like 2 seconds late and stuff like that. Just don’t buy.
Love the game. Would be nice if you can add in the recent trades that occurred, someone add the new roster to our MyCareer.
The game keeps crashing while im in the middle of a game and returns me to my home screen. I can’t even finish a game because the points I scored while it was working didn’t even save. I tried to delete the app and then download it again but that didn’t work. If I delete it again, it might not come back. I need my $7.99 back if this is still an issue.
This game is the best 2k mobile game I have played ,but I would like to see and I know this is a little much ,but online quick games would be awesome and the career mode like 2k17 where you have your own mycourt that would be awesome in the next one. Please take this into consideration even if the game would be 10$ or 15$ I would still buy it if you had all these features. Please think about it.
Ok, How can I not get a rebound when there is a guy 1 WHOLE FOOT SHORTER THAN I AM. Second, Why in the world can’t I make a wide open three WHEN MY PKAYER IS A SPOT UP SHOOTER. Also I go for a steal and it’s either a foul or I end up going 20 FEET away from the defender.
Almost there. I understand it’s an app but the options for play seem a little limited here. Add a 3 point contest and more in game options like calling plays and intentional fouls and the game would be much better.
Once I got to the 2024-2025 season when i go to play the game it just crashes and goes to my home screen and it’s bad because this player was realy good and I spent MONEY ON THIS GAME besides the price to purchase it so I hope you can fix this or could I get a refund because yes I know it was too much money to spend but I spent like $25.00 on it to make my player that good
Great game but it’s too small to play on the new iPhone X plz optimized it
Cmon man I’ve had this awhile now and still no iPhone x support.
I would like to see more hairstyles and better arm sleeves and leg sleeves,.. other than that I’m fine
I really like the game a nice feature/add on would be the All-star team the xbox version has it and I really like that please add all-star
Update for iphone X !!!!! Screen!!!!!!!
Ok so the game is nice and fun asf in all but we need these to make our experience absolutely litt and fun!  •Mypark or a online mode •Easier way to make more vc •More shows or just make them look better •& lastly More Hairstyle and tattoos!????  But overall love the game just, need them things to make me love it better than what I do! It’s ya boy Jaysaucyy From Youtube and Thx! Also go sub to my man YSG Blake on YT Bro thanks a lot!!! I started a series named JaySaucyy IOS on my YouTube channel so please make sure to leave a thumbs up on that if you enjoyed on those videos and I wanna know what y’all love to see next because I really enjoy making nba 2k18 videos on my phone bruh that’s all I gotta say man and deuces 
Best
Great game but would be SO MUCH BETTER if was allowed to  have 15 players available to use! 
Still didn’t fix the bug with the stats in my player...but I like the frequent updates. Makes the game more worth it’s money with all the fixes going on
I like playing 2k especially with this Moga controller i bought for it. Only thing I wish could happen in 2k for MyPlayer is self putbacks/ call for alley oops. Its kind of boring to not do those but can crossover and other stuff.
NBA 2K18 is a great game but it would be much better if u could play with friends or even play multiplayer someway or somehow .
1) let us edit accessories like knee sleeves and headbands of players in the roster 2) more retro and alternate jerseys 3) let us edit the historical all-time roster 
Please unlock all the players in one on one. My Career Mode is way too much.
Don’t get this game it’s a waste of 8 dollar in my career it won’t let me play the last game of the season. I’ve tried everything , turn my phone all the way off, I’ve tried almost 10 time going in to the game but it keep exiting out . Waste of 8 dollars . DONT BUY IT
The only thing I have against this game is the cpu don’t shoot the ball enough in my player & would like to see constant roster updates for this game
I love this game it’s superb but can you please make a new update like we can get classic teams aswell and get we get an updated injury roster it makes the game feel so realistic
Not impressed at all.... Honestly want my money back
Hey thanks for fixing that last game breaking bug but can you guys please add the gm back the trading process takes way too long
It was so awesome and I’m grateful for this great game I love this game it’s fantastic how it works just like an play station four
The game is really great but all my friends don’t want to get it because the my career story mode is sloppy so first of fix the story mode and add i my Park
First of all this game is one of the best games for mobile hands down. But it has some flaw like maybe add some “size up moves” and some better equipment like the real accessories that the basketball players wear people like to dress up there player in gear.
NBA 2K18 need to be fixed on iPod Touch 6 generation.
Terrible Game
I loved this game even with the couple of bugs it had at first. When I first got it, I couldn’t finish a franchise season as it would crash every time I tried. I decided to stick with MyPlayer mode from then on out, but now I can’t even play a single game bc it is so slow that it’s just not worth playing. This has been getting continuously worse with each update of the app. If this can’t be fixed, I would really love a refund because I have never spent so much on an app before only to delete it.
Someone butt raped me
App crashes whenever I try to open MyCareer
This is honestly a great game and I really wish I could give it five stars, but being penalized in career mode for “bad call for ball“ makes the game almost too annoying to play
This is a great game but adding the new Nike city uniforms and other alt. Uni's would be 🔥🔥🔥!!!also I wish you did not have too play my career to unlock unis,I would like to buy em via VC.Please ad em 2k.Also need Blake Griffin with Detroit Pistons too
first of all thank you for updating blacktop mode roster. however, most of them are 99 overall and kareem cant even do his own CLASSIC SKYHOOK move? he has a different form than in real life? whats up with this? could this be fixed and also can the legends be dressed in their team uniform? thank you
Can you make the shooting form more realistic and put Quinn Cook on the warriors. If you don’t do this then I will give you a one star.
AWESOME 👍👌🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀😀😃😄😄😄😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😀😁😆😁😄😅😉😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😅😀😅😀😀😅😅😅😅😅😅😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍😆👍👍👍👍👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
I love this game but I think it would be better if you would put in online multiplayer and also I would like outfits if you do that and also if I hit a green wide open I shouldn’t be missing those shots
Every time I go on my career I play a game and buy things but it doesn’t save for some reason this is ridiculous.
Just update the rosters please so Blake griffin is on the pistons. Also and a rematch button to blacktop and quick games please.
Good game. What could make it better is multiplayer blacktop or something multiplayer like over wifi or bluetooth.
Once u play like a couple weeks of my career it glitches and goes back to the  home screen it’s a bug they need to fix. And once they fix it I will give. A better review after 
1) Player creation should be better than 2k12 by now 2) Lay up mechanics are terrible 3) You should be able to call plays much much better 4) Ball handling is weird and unnatural and everyone basically does the same 5 moves 5) Contested lay ups have a weird animation for everyone and make players body twist 6) Defensive mechanics are weird 7) Makes phone hot when you play for a few minutes 8) Crashes randomly & often 9) When I got past he first Allstar break it won’t let me play a game after and keeps crashing & it took me a long time to get my character at such a high rating his rookie year 10) Takes your battery fast as hell but that’s expected  • It’s enjoyable because it’s like 2k12 with 2k16 graphics on the go but I wouldn't stay it’s worth the price it is when NBA Live is free & NBA JAM is much cheaper  • Players should have a uniqueness to them in the game mechanically everyone moves the same for the most part 
Game won’t let me progress pass making the required fake player. I want a full refund.
This a a really fun game but I am so frustrated with the fact that the app keeps crashing in the middle of a game.  It has happened twice at the end of the game.  There was even a time when I completed a game, saved it, only to come back the next day with my progress lost. Really not motivated to continued my season. Other than its good.
My game was working fine , and now I can only play blacktop games and every time I try to load My Carrier it comes right out and start over , what’s going on ....
I love that you guys are (somewhat) regularly updating the app! I was wondering if you guys were ever going to fix the commentary because it is boring hearing them say the same things over and over AND OVER again. It also cuts off at weird times to. The most annoying part is that the commentators get the name of the players wrong or can’t say Porzingis but can say Antetokounmpo! I wish that I can be more lively like in real life or the console version. Also the equipment needs a graphic update because those beautiful shoes look like garbage! Will you guys ever add more equipment like headbands, arm sleeves, etc. And please update the uniforms design because I see some teams are debuting new uniforms and I would love my character to wear them!
Pure trash. Do not waste your time buying this piece of crap.
Love this game and its the best out there but some obvious things that are really frustrating that need to be addressed. One for me are the kickballs. On loose balls and steals there are at least 3 kick balls a game for me. On pick and roll I get it, or perimeter passing, but pro players don\'t kick balls when they are trying to pick up steals or the ball is simply loose. Also, there are at least 5 goaltending calls a game for me, come on 2k. That and the fact that if I drive into a defender the off balance shuffle that last for 10 minutes while my player regains his balance is a bit cumbersome and unnecessary. I can\'t remember a player being that effected, perhaps consider alternate effects that can keep the game going a little more.  Other than that I\'m very pleased and love the shoot into pass combos you guys have incorporated. Alley oops are cool but those just make it feel so real. Thanks devs, and NO MORE kick balls paaaaaleeese
as the title says, after I finish editing myplayer theres no way to proceed!
I would like to play my Apple Music while playing this game
I had bought around 60,000 vc on NBA 2K18 and I had max out shot creating, 3pt shooting, and play maker. When I bought all of those I was around 76 overall and when I loaded the game I was at a 66 overall, shot creating, 3pt shooting, and play maker weren’t max out. Can you help to get my stuff back?
- 2k still copying from past products, at least update the models of other players (g.hayward, s.adams, k.korver, etc..) to make it feel like a brand new game. In settings, it says ultra high cloth simulation but in game it does nothing why tho (I play in ipad 9.7) and lastly the commentary is bugged, they mention the wrong names. - The game feels like 2k16 with new courts and jerseys.  - In update 1.01, it seems like no bugs were fixed. The commentary is still bugged and the stats in mycareer is still glitched. It seems the roster was the only thing that was updated ang it took 2k 20 days to update it. It only took me 2 days to update the whole roster manually. It’s feels like 2k dosen’t prioritize this game.  - In update 1.03, the commentary is still bugged. It gives us the impression  that your’re not actually working on your game. Like c’mon, there are bugs that are already 3 years old (since 2k15). Might as well expect nba 2k19 to be an unfinished game also. This game is hopeless. 
THIS IS WHY WE PLAY!! ANYTHING LESS THAN 4 STARS PLEASE IGNORE!! MOST PEOPLE DONT HAVE THE SKILLS TO PLAY  NBA 2k18!! So they give bad reviews!!
Very laggy. To the point where it’s too hard to play.
Every last regular game of the season it crashes after you complete the game but it does not safe game data. Right after the press box when it takes you make to your 2k navigation it will crash
The only thing holding me back from 5 star is how we can’t filter the songs in the 2K18 playlist. Idk who thought putting Mexican songs in a basketball game was a good idea but they can seriously annoy me at times.
I can’t move on the the second round in my career. It doesn’t upload the next round games I only can see my last win in the first round.
PLEASE PLEASE ADD COMPRESSION PANTS, PLAYER LOCK, AND CREATE PLAYERS IN MANAGE ROSTER
Please allow incremental updates so I can update.
Game started off great with no problems but seems now when I try finishing a game that it kicks me off and doesn’t save my progress.
Hi 2K devs, I just have a few suggestions that would make the game better some of them are a call for lob option in my career mode. To activate this you might have to press the pass button twice when u don’t have the ball. Another one is a better beard options for example a beard sticking out like James Harden’s would be cool. Lastly I know this is hard but maybe you can add an online blacktop mode where you can play with friends and random people in real time. Thank you for reading this and please consider adding some of these things because it would make the game so much better.
If you are looking for an upgrade from 2K17 there’s not much difference except rosters are updated but I don’t think it’s worth the money
This game would be great if you could actually play it.  Instead, it crashes every 2-3 minutes.  FIX YOUR CRAP!!!!
Good game in all ways except in blacktop some of the positions and matchups are messed up. On the console they match players up by height but on mobile it’s random and it often puts my pg at center. Also big men don’t play like big men so I get Rudy Gobert playing 2 on 2s at the 3pt line when it’s half court. Makes no sense. Otherwise really fun
i spent $25 for upgade of mycareer character but it got corrupted. i always saving it on my icloud but that thing happened and they say it can’t be retrieved
You guys should have it to where we can rematch after a blacktop game instead of quitting and starting all over please fix this nba 2K16 had it but 17 and this one doesn’t! Another thing can you guys please unlock all the Legends instead of playing mycareer for them you guys added a lot of new legends from the update you might as well unlock the rest of them.
We need online feature!! ASAP I wanna be able to play friends
Lots of bugs in the playoff modes. At one point I was unable to even progress. It had me stuck and I could not go on to the next day.
回家后发给你
when you buy a game and the screen does not fit your cell phone! iPhone X on sale in November, it is January 21 and has not yet been corrected? 😡
How do you dunk?
This is the #1 game I play! This game is amazing and I love playing. One thing I don’t like is that in MyCAREER when you’re shooting and you’re release is “excellent” and the grade is “A+” I feel that you should make that shot every time. One little thing and I’d like it fixed.
This game is dope and I love it. It’s 2k. I even got the controller so it’s easy to play. Make it harder on myplayer. After myplayer gets good, It’s too easy. I always end up winning by 40 points , scoring 70 points with 12 3 pointers , 10 steals etc like make the computer play better offense. Make the computer better as a whole. My teammates , and the other teams can just be better. They just be standing around. We don’t get to call plays as a point guard. We can’t zone up on Defense ! The game is a good game but level of play could be wayyyyy better.
It takes up space and If you get green lights it is a 50/50 chance it will go in
The gameplay is great, better than the gameplay on the console. And the new Association mode where you can play more than one season is really fun. But the game takes up too much storage.
@2KSports this game is so terrible it is not even funny. It crashes every five minutes and deletes the progress of the game you just played. Learn how to code because you clearly don’t know how to make a good game
NBA2k18 overall is a really good game, but things like the game frequent crashing and some certain aspects of the game doesn’t show at all. As an example: when I was playing my career mode; my NBA Ranking and Position Ranking did not show. Along with my proficiency. It always showed my stats as ZERO. This has been frustrating to me as of recent. Another example is that my other career mode is not loading, but crashing instead. Every time I try to log into this career mode, the screen would go to loading and then it would crash me out. 2K please fix this issue. Also I hate that there is no camera option is 2k NAV so that I have to play every game and start with changing the camera. It is very irritating. I really hope there is a new update soon that is going to fix the bugs that you presumed are fixed. Thank you, but please look into these issues.
Is a good game like the title said , there a lot of bugs during gameplay, most of it with the narrator . Beside of that the game is great !
Okay so far the game is fun. I also know that on one is perfect, but in my game if I go in for a layup and I get foul the red doesn’t call the foul and I have 96 layup in MyC and can u guys make sure at least 90% of green goes in because I get green but it doesn’t go in. Lastly the jump shot in MyC is not exactly like the player jump shot for example KD and LBJ look alike or Kyrie and MJ jump shot look alike. Plz help us because we love the game so much. Oh yea sorry I last thing in MyC the commentary call brook Lopez LBJ so that need to be fix. Honestly I feel like 2k16 is still the best. THANK YOU
This game is awful! It keeps crashing and I can’t even play it!! WASTE OF MONEY!!!
I bought vc in the game for my player and everytime I play a playoff game the app quits out and I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but I ended up losing money so there is no point of buying this game
I can’t get OKC Alternate jerseys , there’s nobody in connections that has it , I have 2.6mil fans and I can’t find anyone with OKC alternate jersey in connections
When ever I go into career I get back to the home screen so I can’t play
First off when I got this I loved it but I been getting very upset from this game I spent  9.99 NBA coins and when I save my data and get off it just restarted my data back to 58 overall. I would love to see if this gets updated soon so I don’t have to waste more money on myself and I can just grind daily when I get the chances.
This game favors teams over others in association mode. A team that I built featured Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Gordon Hayward yet was beat by the Cavaliers in 4 games. This would never happen in real life and I think the game should be more realistic.
So far I downloaded it yesterday and it is amazing! But the music is trash with all the remixes and you can’t turn off the mycareer music .when I was downloaded it I was hoping it was gonna be like nba2k18 but it’s more like nba2k17 on a ps3. Same haircuts, same Tattoos, you don’t get to wonder around stores and parks like in nba2k18, you barely get to customize  Myplayer. Another thing is saving it’s always going through a save every 30s or a minute. The store in Mycareer is trash, shoes are ok but the legs and arms are trash there’s no arm sleeves, undershirts, leg sleeves only wrist bands and high socks 
I love the game but we need curry with his hair in real life and Durant with his compression pants it will be great if we had that thank you,
Just updated the new iOS version of the game & I still can’t advance in my my career! I don’t know why but can you guys please fix it. I’m stuck in my first season m can’t continue n it irritating due to the fact this the only game I play
First off, the game is so much better this year. There are just a few things I would like to see change  1. Uploading to iCloud takes forever. This is super annoying to anyone who plays MyCareer 2. If you cut, then it is an automatic bad call for pass even if you are wide open 3.  Alternate jerseys are old and outdated, please replace with the new statement edition 4. Please add a MyTeam mode, would make the game so much better 5. Legends from the all-time teams need to be usable on Blacktop  Otherwise great game, good job 2K 
My association team keeps crashing and it won’t let me get past a certain point before shutting me out of the app
Dear 2K please allow us to put Named  bread shoes on basketball players can you add practice mode in the video game update facial players like Jimmy Butler at a turbo button stick to the NBA 2K16 controller Add more moves to the game play redo the back row menu
This game is fun to play I enjoy it it’s an improvement over last years, but please optimize this game for iPhoneX users we should be able to google into full screen mode so we can enjoy our display! Me and many other iPhoneX owners Would love to see this updated soon!
Games pretty amazing. You should try it!
they need to update this for iphone x
I loved all the 2ks I’ve purchased so far all are really good
Hi 2k, don’t know if you will actually take the time to do this. I have been playing 2k in iOS since 2k15. The game has gotten better each year. Can y’all make it so we can change the difficulty of mycareer mode? I would love to try playing on hall of fame. My guy is a 96 overall killing everyone, would love a challenge. Second, can y’all make it so we can do the actual all star events, the 3 point contest or the skills challenge or the dunk contest. If y’all fix these recommendations this game will get 5 stars.
I’ve been playing this iOS version pretty much from the beginning. They’ve made some progresses over the years in terms of graphics and gameplay. However, there are some lingering bugs carrying over for 3 years that they never care to fix or are unable to, such as stats issues, and offensive rebounds and post out is not working at all. Also lack of dynamics of connecting with other players and endorsement. They just stop working after a little while, which takes away some fun of the game. This game has so much potential, but they never made this game whole for some reason.
Y’all still got the white players with black arms and it’s driving my crazy. Also update the players haircuts. This game is trash.
First off when I get to mycerrer and I make a new player the game gets all laggey and the screen glitches majorly so 2K please fix this I know it’s a lot but please try this game is awesome
I really wish 2k18 for iOS had MyTeam. People could open packs and play each other it would be a lot funner to me.
Give me support for the iPhone X or I’m not gonna play this anymore
Pls update for iPhone X full screen. It’s too small to play on my iPhone X. Thank you.
I swear to god I better get my money back. I spent $80 on this game (I can show you the receipts) and it’s just going to crash after the season and when I reload it’s stuck in some sort of “purgatory” mode in my career where I can’t exit or advance to any games. I want my money back or I’m never buying and spending money on NBA 2k and go to madden. I’m very disappointed in this game. Fix the Jerseys and get an ultimate team. Even tho we all know this is just some extra thing to bring in money. We know you don’t care about making the game better. But for now I want my money back. Thank you and have a good day.
I am in the middle of the game and it starts to hang up....   Im playing my career playoff then its started to hang up... all what i made from the game was lost...and needs to repeat again...   Pls fix this bugs ty... 
Great overall game but When I’m trading picks in the draft I can’t see what number pick it is. Free agency needs a big over haul with the top free agents at the top and sort it by overalls and position
It’s a great game, especially because the developer added the “The Association” mode. But I think that game mode will be better if there will be a “Create Your Own Team” option. I even think it will make the game app great.
If you play in any career mode be prepared to get your heart crushed when you can’t go past a playoff game. Not just me that have said this. Really lame to have this happen. Even if saving at a point in the game, after the game is over and it’s going to save your win or loss it crashes . Fugging lame
The commentary is still jacked up and doesn’t work when it should....SAME AS LAST YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE. The stats aren’t correct in my career and are never correctly updated. Also, Please fix screen resolution for IPhone X please. It’s a waste....
When you get to the playoffs, right after you finish a game and get to the interview the game crashes and doesn’t even save. PLEASSEE FIX 🙏
I love the game! But the only thing I’m seeing is that I will be in the playoffs in my career and the game would crash. But overall I love the game
This games needs to go for free not always on price but the shots I Make are 🔥 and I love what they did how to upgrade your player😎🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀💵🏀🏀🏀🏀😇🤑😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️👽☠️☠️☠️👹👹👹👺👹👹👹👹👹👺🤡🤡💩💩👻👻👻👻💩💩💩💩💩💩👿😈😈😷🤠🤑🤑🤮🤮🤮🤮🤕🤢🤮🤑🤕🤑🤠😈
Would love to see the full screen  But this is an excellent game 
I played this game in career mode for a while until i hit my first year playoff, but on the last game of the first round it always crashes after i finished before saving. Dev please fix this so i can play it again
Please fix.Game 7 of the first round and I get past it but then it crashes and makes me play the game over again please fix because I love this game and I can’t advance because it keep crashing
I would give this game 5 starts but recently my carreer has started to crash  on me when i try to load the save plz replay or fix this bug please.
I bought this app and it keeps crashing. Either they fix it or give me my money back!
You need to put lemolo balls hair in please and the I will put five stars
Game will not save to iCloud after a full game is played
First thong is that whenever its mycareer and i am on the last game of the season i finish the game and it doesn’t say W or L and i have to keep playing that game and it won’t go on and another thing is that can you put a way to play multiplayer or an online blacktop mode
Hola Saludos espero que estén bien tengo un problema con el juego y es que cuando llegó a los playoff le gano al contrario y luego no me cuenta y se sale del juego es el único problema espero que arreglen ése problema que pasen buenas tardes gracias.
People have already mentioned the game crashes and yet no update.
This game was getting me super hyped and then it took 3 hours to download and I ended up deleting it in frustration
All we need is a park and my court plllllllzzzzzzzz😫😢😭
for once, i’d like to be able to see the correct stats. my teams record still shows 0-0 and i’m well into my season, all of my player’s states are still showing zero and i’m dropping 30 points, 10 plus assists and plenty of steals and rebounds a game. it’s a bit annoying when you know you’re progressing, but it’s not indicated in the numbers. PLEASE fix. i’m tired of this every time i purchase this franchises game.
There are some improvements from 2017 but there are still some BIG issues with 2018. In MyCareer mode, I cannot advance in my 2nd year in the playoffs. The game keeps crashing. This game is an utter disappointment.
I bought the 9.99 Vic pack it said I’d get 40,000 free if I did I never received my vc coins so I was wondering if y’all could fix that, also when my shot placement thing turns green (excellent release and perfect timing) that stuff I still miss like does that make sense. On the bright side the game is incredibly fun letting you create team with the best players, I like how for a mobile game this good of a caliber you can play it online!
If u get a perfect release you might miss it there isn’t a 100% chance that you’ll miss a green
Last game of myCareer will crash after I play it and will reset the game and I’ll have to replay it.
I love this game but I'm not happy with it for the fact that it crashes when trying to save the game progress in icloud. Always during playoff games. Please fix this problem.
The gameplay is great put it takes so much battery u won’t even believe it
Love the game but the game have a great deal of glitches.  After reaching the finals, it doesn’t go to the next game. I played the same game multiple times winning.  Also, there’s no foul calls at the three point shooting or if you jump and foul someone.
iPhone X Update Please
Don’t get me wrong I love this game but it kicks me out ALL the time. I trying to play and it keeps kicking me out. I’m in the finals on association about to win and it kicks me out and makes me start all over. I really want to play but it’s just not working. If you can fix this please help me. This has been my only problem so far.
What a waste of money!  The “my career” freezes the game every time. Numerous email to support with no solutions. Buyer beware!
It’s a good game but they need to add regular sleeves and and tights because the one the have are pretty ugly. All the other players have regular sleeves so why can’t we
Best mobile game ever made! See many cool modes! Definitely worth the price!
Finish a season and stuck in Playoffs - every time I win Game 1 the game crashes on trying to save and go to Game 2 - start over and over and it does the same thing - please FIX
It’s a great game... I spent $20+ on vc and it crashes and crashes. Please fix the issue.
I spent all this be just so I can’t play, I finish the last playoff game on my best mc and when the game finishes and we won it exits me off the game then I go back on to the game and it wants me to replay it even though we won so now I’m just in a endless cycle of redound this game I hope u read this review and can fix the issue or else I want a refund
One word: awesome
Holy Hell what a friggin AWESOME game!!!!!!!!! I never really played basket ball but hell yeah I’m a baller woot woot MVP 3xs in a row shaweett . But now I have to ask is there an issue with the iPhone X crashing ???? Anyway sweet game thank you 😊
I am stuck in a perpetual loop of the game crashing right after a game. As a result, nothing saves and I have to play the same game over and over.
Game crashes every time I finish a playoff game and it makes me restart the game that I just got done finishing
I really like this game and all. But I’m in the 2nd season in MyPlayer and in the playoffs and I complete the game and it goes to the save screen and it glitches and kicks me out of the app. Please help and make this stop.
There must be an update on the way because I can not possibly be the only person experiencing issues with the app. Ever suggestion was completed from deleting old files and other apps to free up space on the iPhone which is only currently using 14 GB of space on the 128 model. Also is the a dedicated channel on the “BOX”? I could not locate such.  The issues :  The commentary is incorrect. The players names are not used according to the plays completed. The man on the mic calls BRON the wrong name. He not only calls him the wrong name, he never refers to him as king James.  The game has a glitch type feel where the graphics seem to flicker. The players jerseys are missing pieces from the animations.  Currently running the latest iOS as of today 8:30pm EST. 11.2.2. Yeeeeeeeee🙏 
Everything about the mobile version feels and looks like the console version. I didn’t find out 2K had released a mobile version till I saw a co-worker playing in the break room. When I first saw it I thought he was streaming a live match till I asked.   Only question is does this game feature an online mode? 
Update to fit iPhone X screen
Fun at first but then,Whenever the game finishes, it crashes. It doesnt save the progress.
The game is ok and all but when my player was an 86 overall and I pressed save it to iCloud it changed my player back to a 69 overall and now I have to start over stupid game
So I’m in the playoffs in mycarrer and I’m going against the wizards and I’m beating them repeatedly.But every time after the game the Game restarted then when I go back into mycarrer it says u can start the next game and I haven’t been able to get pass game 1 and this is my fifth time playing game 1
Need an update: my career continuously crashes at the end of the season during the playoffs. It does not allow me to move past my final game PLEASE FIX otherwise I love this game so much fun.
I have always enjoyed this Franchise but this development isn't good. Kicks me out very consistently, almost like I'm dropping service. Very disappointed in all the glitches.
Game keeps crashing during the playoffs
It’s a bad game doesn’t work after awhile
This game is fine but it blanks out every  min I have been trying to do something for 1 hr!!!!!!!!!!!! And it still isn’t working because it just brings me back to the home screen and dosent save!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The game is great!!! But when will the iPhone X update come out.
Won’t let me download!! Right when it gets to installing it says “NBA2K18 couldn’t download. Try again.” I have looked things up to help and the ideas don’t work. I have tried MILLIONS of times to download. I would like my money back or need more tips to try to download this.
Being able to play a great team on season mode if even have to buy would be great. Also not to have rookie and pro modes so different. Rookie super easy pro mode 100 times harder than rookie mode I need a super team to win.career mode really good.also need to fix rebounding computer has a 50/50 chance or more of getting a rebound after every miss.
I just made it to the last game of the season on “my player mode “ and now the app crashes after I won and it crashes every time I try to load the app back up it crashes. I play on a iPhone 7. Fix please !!!!!!!!!!!
....
Devs: playing on iPad Pro, after the very first post-season game right after the post-game conference, no matter how I answer the question, the game shuts down during save forcing me to replay the game.  I’ve rebooted the iPad between tries to no avail and this has happened 5 times in a row, and I cannot move past.  Please fix!
Cuz it’s crappy content
Can’t install refund
After the 3rd game in the playoffs I do the media part and after that it crashes every time this happened in last years as well please fix ASAP
This game was great until I made it to the playoffs... now the app just crashes every time I try and finish a game. Makes me restart the game again.
I was playing in the my career mode when the game crashed. Came back to find all that data just gone. Not worth the money if that kind of thing happens.
want it to be 0 star but it wont let me
fix how after a game when you are at the press conference & you go to continue after the game & the app shuts down & doesn’t save the game i just played & i play the game over & over but at the end it always shuts down, its really pissing me off
Since the update came out my game keep crashin after im done with one of the games in career mode
Can u just fit the iPhone X’s screen cause made me delete the game because of bad display
LOVE the game, but every time I finish first round of playoffs game crashes right after the “press conference”. Would easily be a 5 Star game if I could actually continue my playoff run and start a new season. PLEASE fix this!
This game is so intensive and makes my phone a furnace and drains so much battery power, and does it at a low framerate. I have a 6s, and this game optimization is terrible.
Game keeps crashing after the first match of playoffs, first season, career mode. What can I do?
Connect mobile to mobile iphone users
I have played a full my career season and am in the first round of the playoffs. At the completion of 2nd game after picking interview answer game force closes and acts as if game never happened. Tried 3 times picking different answers still same result.  Also if you could update for iPhone X so we can use our full screen.  Other than those things, battery drain, and stats being incorrect great game I play every day 
I can shoot a perfect shot and still miss it and it happens way too often. Should be able to adjust difficulty level on mycareer mode. Burns battery quickly. Free throw release timing is dumb. Not worth the $5
Is there anyway I can turn off the hard cap/salary cap like on the console ? If so where do I find it because I’ve looked through settings and pretty sure I’m not missing it but if I am can someone let me know where to go so I can turn it off.
In the 4th quarter put in 20 min at an A- only to have it crash and reset to first quarter. This has happened multiple times. Soooo frustrating. Fix this asap or refund!!!
Please keep updating
My experience was awesome until the last update now every time I play my career mode at the end of the 3rd quarter the app force closes constantly
What do I do if my career crashes me out of the app
Really love the game and it’s lots of fun, but playing the game on the iPhone X is nearly impossible. As soon as I really get into the game it always pauses and freezes because the game thinks I’m trying to swipe home. There should be a way to disable the home button during live gameplay whereas it’s deactivated when u pause the game. The gameplay buttons r to close to the home swipe at the bottom of the screen and this creates a real interference with smooth gameplay.
I can Not create a myplayer to put on any team. You can only assign existing players to the roster. Only if I have a my career is when I can create a player but only for mycareer. Secondly, I can’t edit any of the all time rosters which I would like to do. I can’t choose my NBA2k playlist either.. last but not least.. Please allow me to edit more because it takes away from the game overall experience
No one seems to be saying so it I will: this is a super lazy port and it’s works just well enough to be playable. I want to like it so bad but it’s just not good. And if you don’t want to spen your career terrible, you’ll be spending some money. Which makes the terrible quality of the $8 game feel even worse.
I’m in the finals right now and after I finish a game the app always glitches and shuts down kicking me out losing all the data from that game
The app always crashes and sometimes i cant even open the app. Needs to be fixed soon. Still broken. Crashes after every game while trying to save. UPDATE NEEDED
I already made a review just addressing a current problem im just now having. After the newest update that has been recently released now that im in the playoffs after the game is over and after the press conference the game just shuts off and take me back to my home screen on my iphone. Not sure what is the problem
IVE PLAYED THIS GAME FOR 2 DAYS AND ITS TERRIBLE I GET EXCELLENT SHOT AND I STILL MISS IT CRASHES AND THEN DRAINS MY BATTERY TRYING TO RESUME ITS HORRIBLE DONT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP I WANT MY 8 DOLLARS BACK 2K18
Crashing app ruins any progress made. App says it saves but it doesn’t.
I started to really get into my career mode but now whenever I try to advance to the next day it shuts off and I go back to my home screen, so I haven’t been able to play my career.
There’s minor bugs that need to be addressed, and are being experienced on an iPhone 5s:  MYCAREER - There’s a bug that doesn’t allow the full save to happen after a game has completed and crashed in the menu where you select to go to the next day’s game.  GENERAL GAME PLAY - There’s a glitch (which I’ve used to my advantage so far) that allows me to make the AI drop the ball if I jump on them, and it should be considered an offensive foul!  The gameplay lags at certain times. It slows down so much sometimes that it moves at like 1 frame every 2 seconds. FIX THE LAGING ISSUES.  Other than that, its a fun game just like the console version of 2K18! 
Can we please get multiplayer mode instead of free ply that would be amazing experience with this game but overall this Excellent!
I lost my 87 pg 5 games before the playoffs I can’t play with him no more and on my other pg it says 0-0 even though I play more than 30 games and need more a button so you player can get set up for an alley hoop then what’s the point of an slasher and needs a ft throw practice so you can get your ft throw rating up and team practice and also better shoes and gear and on association mode can you be able to get rid of salary cap so you can get players on the off season and be a able to sign players for more than a year and I know it’s an app but like add online for it so it be more and like a mypark so the game but they game is really fun just fix the bugs and update more frequently
First off all NBA players don’t miss 10374739210273 layups in a row. Like y’all got them playing like they in the D League. And blacktop be cheating. They be walking and just throwing up shots and they be goin in like dets not how you ball like dafuk.
Needs an iPhone X update cause I play on mine and it don’t use the full screen
I LOVE this game but currently I’m unable to play the 2nd round of the playoffs. My game is stuck. I’ve tried everything and it will NOT advance to the next round. What can I do before i contact for a refund?
There is a bug that when I finished one game, but I can’t save it because flashback automatically in the My Career mode. May be my phone， but I want you check it then fix it，please！
This game is so cool and there’s nothing else i can really say. I’d like for the game to be updated to the iphone x screen tho.
First of all it’s a great game I love all the new features you’ve added like shoot around mode in my career and all time greats teams but I have some suggestions for you guys to improve on.  My career- Be able to adjust the difficulty in gameplay right now I just keep destroying every team I play against. I’m pretty sure everyone would love it if we could change the difficulty to hall of fame instead of rookie.  My career-Be able to perform alley oops. We should be able to call for alley oops for example the control to call for an Alley oop should be three taps on the pass button. You should also be able to perform self alley oops on fast breaks and stuff.  My career- Replay mode I think it would be great if you could have a mode where it would replay the last play and stuff like that plus in this mode we should also be able to slow down the replay so if we replay a dunk it would look cooler and we should be able to look at it from different angles.  My career-Better equipment  You should add more shoes and supreme sleeves and stuff like that it would be super cool  My career-Player edits Be able to change your nickname and weight Also be able to change your number so if you trade teams and someone has the number you previously had you could change it to another number you like. Also be able to choose your college  My career-Fouling and teammates A lot of the times I would pump fake at the three point line and the guy would literally just tackle me. I think those should be fouls. I would like it if my teammates would actually know how to play half the time I pass it to my teammate and he just stands there until the shot clock is down to one. Also half the time my teammates never dive and just stand out of bounds.   My career- Play call and timeout call I think the player should be able to call a play or a timeout it would be cool if my team could full court press and not run the same play all the time. If we could call timeouts it would be pretty cool to.  My career- Player Animations You should be able to trigger flashy pass and fake pass stuff like that. It would be very cool if we could do that.   Overall it’s a pretty good game but these suggestions I think would really help. I only did my career suggestions because everyone plays that the most and everyone I think would like these suggestions. If you do copy and paste all of this and put it in your review. 
I enjoy this game as my “play” of choice.  It’s not far off from the experience of the actual console game, given the fact it’s on a mobile device.  Great job in that regard.  However, I have one MAJOR problem here that needs addressing ASAP.  I’m stuck on the fourth game of the first round playoffs and have been for two days now.  Simply because the game will not continue.  It crashes immediately, every time after the game is over.  This is in the MC mode, and I’m playing on my iPhone 6 Plus.     Thanks 
It glitches all the time. It crashes all the time. It calls players by the wrong name. The career stats are glitched. The rosters are not updated.
You need to fix your defense system and your offensive controls cause the lag and your double tap ally-oop system is stupid fix it please  Ps:the game is good but trash too 
Please fix the CPU so that they don’t take up the whole shot clock time every possession.  Otherwise solid game.
How do you dunk?
Every time my player is driving in the paint the ball just falls out his hands
I be tryna go on my career and it crashes  it works for quick game  and for blacktop  not career  and it ain’t the phone cuz it’s the newest phone  it was just working 3 days ago  fix it
This game is legitimate but the only thing that’s terrible about it is you can’t listen to the music on your phone and play the game at the same time. I want to listen to my own hoop tunes while playing this game. No offense to the in game music.
This game isn’t the best you miss greens just why and also make an update for this game it's crashing all the time just why I don’t want to waste all of my money
It’s fun with all time greats but if there was a way you could pick the team form the year and play as that roster it but better and if you when drafting players you can draft old players also if when you customize a roster you can put old players in teams and can find them as free agents
I love this game, it’s amazing but there’s one problem I’m facing right now. right  now I am in the playoffs vs the wizards in my career mode but every time i finish the first game it would kick me out the game and I would be back at my home screen. I can’t do anything right now because I’ve tried deleting and downloading the game but the same problem is still there. I can play everything else on the game except my career because if I just play then it just sets me back to my last save point which was in the first game near the last minutes of the fourth quarter. Please fix this and keep up the good work.
You guys do updates but, you guys still are missing a lot. More accessories (arms sleeves and all that good stuff) Also, why did you guys only leave us with 14 ugly follow throughs🤦🏽‍♂️ I want to be able to have all follow throughs like 2k16 had, please.. and fix the double team situation, I can’t be clutch if 2-3 players keep teaming me up after I score 10 points!
The game was ok. The reason I say that is because on blacktop the players aren’t wearing Ballerz jerseys, their wearing their own team jerseys, so sometimes it’s hard to tell which player is on your team. Another thing was that the camera it started you out with was sometimes cutting the players off when they were passing the ball in. One more thing was when someone makes a shot their name wasn’t being announced, it just said there number. So if these all get improved, then maybe this would get a 5 star from me.
The last game crashes, you are stuck in season 1, cannot progress into second season
Fun gameplay.  Unfortunately it has started freezing and, now that I’m in the playoffs, it won’t let me get past game 3.  As soon as I’m done, the game automatically shuts down.  When I restart, i have to replay the same game. This has now happened 4 times. $8 for a trip to game three of the first round of the playoffs...not a good deal.
Great game,but I think you need to update some of the players by giving them their tattoos like JJ Redick,Stephen Curry,Kelly Oubre JR,Etc.You also should add the European league again and add LaMelo and LiAngelo Ball to the Lithuanian team.You should also add Technical fouls,Flagrant fouls,and ejections.
Best nba game ever very good graphics compared to 2k16 and 2k17 and very fluid but I would like to see a few changes if you could practice with other players to not just in my career
In my player my record is stuck at 24-11 and also super easy to blow them out should add a difficulty to my player for more experience players also should add 3pt shooting contest please fix bugs
Everything is really good, but theres just one major flaw and, you need to add iPhone X support for the screen size and it will be great so please make a iPhone X update please.
Can it please just get another update to fix the bugs because it’s not letting me play
Overall I enjoy this game a lot, BUT in my career as soon as I got the playoffs after every single game 2k crashes and deletes all my progress so I am essentially stuck in the playoffs forever. I tried to simulate through but I got to a game 7 which I can’t simulate and now I am stuck in that game 7 forever.
It won't save after the games. It will not save games after I play them. Plz fix this
In my career mother page for me to begin doesn’t show up . 
Great
Love it needs slam dunk contest and three point contest should be able to change players equipment in mycareer too
Bad game👎🏿
Hello, I spend real money to buy VC to upgrade my player. Something happened and all the money I spent on my player is gone. I payed at least $60 total. Please help me with this.
I have an iPhone 6 with good memory and latest OS version, still the rendering is slow and the save is the worst, takes for ever. Btw, my internet too is super fast.
This game has been lagging lately and I was supposed to have 100000 coins but I only have 100
This game is great but why is there a BIG shooting delay. This makes me take shots way after I want to take them. The delay is at least 2 seconds which is crucial in basketball. Please fix this PLEASE!!
Could be a nice game if they format the screen for an iPhonex.. it uses about 75% of the screen.. Less than other apps that aren’t optimized. In turn the controls are tiny even if you make them larger it’s just makes them closer together resulting in multiple mistakes when trying to dribble or just play d you end up blocking or shooting.. if I woulda known it was this small I wouldn’t buy it. And I don’t recommend to any one with an iPhonex.. also the controls thing wouldn’t be so bad if you could customize the layout and space them out how you want, instead of the three defaults that are all equally too close
It was a great game until my career stopped loading every time i go to load it closes the app
Make the game compatible with regular iPad minis
I downloaded this game for my iPad and it barely even works, a complete waste of money. It’s slow and laggy and the screen is always flashing bright annoying colors.
Created players pleaseee!
I can’t resign players in association mode. One season half of my team was gone because I couldn’t resign them. Please fix this as soon as possible!!!!
It’s not worth it a game that looks like it has ps2 graphics, a ps2 save system, and worst of all doesn’t even save most of the time don’t waste your money to rage and lose every game you play it’s just not worth it
It would be helpful if it was more compatible with iOS 11. I updated my phone and now I can’t even play the game I love so much. It’s so frustrating!
I want to start by saying this is a very fun app but it has one problem. Every time I finish a career mode game the app would glitch and kick me out of the app especially during a playoff game. This is very irritating and I hope you guys can fix this sooner.
I have to admit I like this game. I love sports games on consoles but no longer have the time or appetite for them. The 2K basketball games are about as close as anyone has come to console quality on iOS  sports games as far as I’m concerned. Unfortunately, a controller makes a big difference and 2K18 is no longer compatible with the SteelSeries Nimbus, at least on an iPhone X on iOS 11. Please fix this 2K!!
Nothing's different from NBA 2k17 you guys basically just changed the title :/
Tried downloading on 3 different wifi’s I have more than enough storage and it still won’t let me download the game but took my money!
Every time I finish the first play off match and it sends me to the game calendar, the app just crashes, and it has me restart the whole thing.
Lol I want it to download faster
It’s amazing but it drains too much battery in about 20-30 minuets Also you should add some stuff from XBOX and PS4. Like the neighborhood and it’s dumb that you have to unlock legends and you should just have every roster from each team from each year. Another thing is that there is no freestyle!! One cool thing you should add is a way you can play online with other people.Like in MyCareer there should be MyPark like on XBOX and PlayStation. One thing that really disturbs me is that a dude is white and has black arms⁉️. Honestly what is that. Please fix and add my suggestions up 🔝   Thank you 2K for reading this Hope you like my feedback 
You know this mobile version, but the ps4 and xbox have way better graphics and they have a neighborhood and all shoes and it kinda makes it unfair for people that can’t have a console and have to use mobile so 2K please add a neighborhood all shoes and better graphics in mobile 2k19 if you can do that please
Normally I reserve 1 star ratings for *really* poor experiences. But while this game can be fun and has the potential to be fun, the fact that the game completely crashes once you finish the first game of playoffs in MyCareer mode makes the money spent on the game useless. Reinstalling the game as well does not seem to solve the issue either. The game, no matter what I do, completely crashes after any game played in playoffs and after the press conference. No progress thereafter is saved.   But in the end that’s not what pushed this review entirely to receive 1 star. The review itself receives 1 star ultimately because support has yet to provide any insight as to not only what the cause is or if someone is actually addressing the issue. It’s been roughly 2 weeks and I’ve sent a couple of follow up messages now. I have an iPhone 8 Plus, so I cant imagine this bug has anything to do with outdated devices. But even if it did, some help or follow up from tech support would mean something. Because there has yet to be any solve for this matter and still no follow up from support, I’m forced to delete the game and just count this as a sunk cost. While I could wait longer, at that point I’d like to believe I’m being rather generous as I’m sure players in this industry wouldn’t demonstrate the same amount of patience or commitment to see a game fixed before giving up on it entirely.   I hate to leave such scathing reviews, especially since I work in the service sector and understand how much these things impact people. But this truly is a terrible experience and one that has left me to think spending money toward mobile games made by 2K Sports has come to an end. If a response does come from this review that might expedite a fix (or even a freaking follow up) then I may reconsider. But based on this I think I’m now just done.   All other players alike beware. 
It cuts off about half of the screen on my iPhone X😡
Played with my MyPlayer for awhile and developed him to a high level but now the game crashes whenever I’m in myplayer and I am not able to play and will most likely lose what I have achieved
The game is great but 1 game takes up 40% of my battery so I deduct one star
The game freezes and cuts off after I win a playoff game so I have to start the game that I won over and it does it again please fix this I spent money on this
This game is very fun I’ve played it for a while, but there are two problems that I wish you would fix. The first problem is the green light. Whenever you make a green it should go in, but it doesn’t like 80% of the time and it makes me mad. The second problem is whenever you buy VC it says on some offers that you get like 105,000 VC free, but it doesn’t give it to you. So if you fix that problem you owe me like 120,000-150,000 VC.
They should really add in Lonzo balls jump shot because I created lonzo ball but don’t have his jump shot😕
Game has a lot of issues. You can get a better game for free until this make this better. They have a lot to tweak but I wouldn’t pay for it yet. It can be a great game and I can see where they are headed so I’m excited unless they don’t fix things. This should be cheaper or things should be fixed.
After finishing all the games in regular season, the app just crashes and then went back to the last game. Please fix this problem!!
The game is pretty good, but, the first game I played on quick game, the graphics aren’t really that good, that’s the only problem
Ppl may leave a good review but they either just got the game and haven’t realized in my career it glitches SO bad YOU CANT even pass the ball. You might think this is just one bad review like I thought so I got the game but worst desicon ever ...mine as well throw that money away!
If it says unable to download log out of iTunes and log back in and try it again. I did it and it worked thanks internet
Great game but its been starting to crash ever since i got to the playoffs
Ok guys I love the game. But it takes to much storage.
It gets so hot really fast and idk if I gets really hot becuz of the intense graphics or what but damnn
In MyCareer, when you get to the first round of the playoffs, the game crashes after you do your post-game interview, and won’t save any progress. Please fix this bug so I can keep playing in the game, thank you.
Great game but graphics are terrible
Career mode crashes every now and then. Very frustrating to play the same game over and over again
I had to pay 5  bucks for this thing and still rather play nba live for free
I know some people might want to be mad but the game needs so meny improves when I play it exits out of the game I get mad on my ps4 I can get cool shoes and stuff I played 2K since 5 years old
Fun game, when it works properly. In My Career mode, I'm currently in the playoffs and can't seem to move on to the Finals because every time I play my Game 7, I finish completely, win, but lag out (not counting the win). Veery frustrating.
Overall it is a great game.Just like nba 2K16 and nba 2K17,I loved both. I just want contact dunk packages. Then you know what contact dunks you get. Make new contact dunks too! people also want a multiplayer, with a way to rep up and change your outfit. I know it may take a while but it will give people more reasons to buy and play the game. as a finishing touch have your my career player be able to call for an alley oop. Hopefully you guys make these changes.
Man dis game good but it keep deleting my player stuff I was a 81 overall now I’m a 60
Wow,This game is really good but I need help,how do I change my shoes in this game?
I have been playing the game and it is getting kind of annoying I am MISSING GREENS how does that happen also the jump shot glitches and is supper hard to be consistent with
As a long time NBA 2k owner (11-18) I was quite saddened to find that 2k 18 on mobile is designed like 2k 14 on 360 and Lags HORRIBLY almost during ALL GAMEPLAY. However it features most game modes found on console.
Great Gameplay but need to do an update ASAP to fix glitches! The app close when a game is finished.
it crashes after a game before saving in my player mode.
It freezes every 0.2 sec and it doesn’t stop
I had it on my phone before and I have enough storage so can you guys fix this immediately. I have been trying for 4 MONTHS NOWW!!! This is URGENT!!!!!! Im board as crap😑
I was first really impressed.  All the options that have been upgraded from the last one...great idea.  In the end..we all know 2K cheats a lil on some of the fouls and shots for ai..it happens and ig it make you play harder..but this sh*t..blatant in your face rookies making layups over 3 defensive superstars all the time..and real shot makers making mid ranged Excellent A+ airballs...on all star...like really...I want a refund already..it’s not the fact of getting outplayed...let’s face it even Jordan had bad days...it’s the point of being just cheated...it’s kinda sad but I’d rather downgrade to 17 then this jus on being cheated out of sh*t..I mean y call it an Excellent A+ if misses 3x in a row.??
I have a 32 gigabyte phone and this takes up 4 gigs and I have bearly used the app
Your teammates are so bad you are set up to lose every game. The shoot button doesn’t even work half the time. The controls barley work so you can’t do any dribbling moves. Garbage especially for 5$
It is the worst game ever and doesn’t work with iPhone X bigger screen
Great game. However, I am struggling with a major glitch. In my rookie season, I am in the Eastern Conference semis. Every time I complete the first game, everything is okay, but after I answer the media questions, the game says it is loading, but crashes as soon as it returns to the mycareer main menu. Please fix
Awesome game with the new legend update and my career are like the only ways I like this game
Why do I have to play my last game for the season like 30x already literally b4 sending me back to my phone home page , like I need my money back or something not cool , 2k17 work way better on my Samsung j3 better than my iPhone 2K18 that cost way more and the 17 on android
I have the game on my ps4 but when I got the game here the grafics were bad the real game is better it needs improving
Commentators glitch all the time saying the wrong team, player...does not save stat averages for career mode. My career mode stopped working. Every time I click on my next game it takes me out of the app and to my home screen. Please fix these bugs with an update soon
I like this game but the my player. I have this on my PlayStation and it is different there is no park like on the PlayStation and you put the my player like the one on nba2k14
Major bugs, if the cpu has the ball with 1sec it goes in all the time! If they add better commentary it be 4-5 stars  let’s face it 2K18 no matter on Xbox, PlayStation Nintendo switch, mobile. They’re greedy devils of this lifetime. Not in the one to come tho, so I forgive in advance it’s big business I understand. But the Lord says how hard is it for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of the needle first. So let all theses greedy corps like Apple, 2K, etc gain all till they cant. Whether they believe or not hell is real and we must all get reborn and live like Jesus to escape the wrath of God, that judgment day, day of reckoning! So I’ll live holy and acknowledge and walk with Jesus whom saved me from real demons I was trapped by. And be at peace. Yes these greedy devs provoked me to tell it like it is the truth!, cause I seen how greedy they are.
I received a GameVice controller as a gift and was excited to try it so I bought nba 2k. Controller worked great until I had shoot fouls shots no buttons worked to shot a foul shot. I tried discounting controller, restarting iPad, re downloading game, etc. Nothing worked. So now the game is worthless. Does anyone know how to fix this glitch?? If not I’d like a refund??
Yep start playoffs first game win post interview leaves game attempts save shuts off game and it repeats so I can’t even play playoffs mycareer just be a trash year for 2k mobile and console/pc
I’ve been trying to download thin for three days now and it just says eating and if I tap the app icon then it says loading but it stays at the top thanks for stealing money from me
My app crashes every time I play a game in the association and in my player I need y’all to fix the game or give me my money back ASAP
Every time I play it crashes 2-3 minutes into the first quarter. I wish I could get a refund to purchase another game.
NBA 2K18 Mobile is incredible, big step from nba 2k17 Mobile. I’m proud of you 2K! BUT PLEASE, FIX GREENS. I’m probably the only one saying this but please. I don’t know if you did it so it wouldn’t be too easy, but that’s what hall of fame is for right?
I bought it but it’s not downloading
I love this game so much but out of nowhere the game started crashing over and over again and idk what to do, I’m playing my career and I’m in the western conference semifinals on game 6 but once the games over it just crashes for some reason.
Mine is stuck in my playoff game and I finish the game and it just crashes
Every time I download this game it always says unable to download and it’s been pissing me off because I spent $5 for something that doesn’t work.
Great game. I'm not going to rant about the passing because others have, but also I have just adjusted to it. I am struggling with a major glitch. In my rookie season, we are in the Eastern Conference semis. Every time I complete the first game, everything is okay, but after I answer the media questions, the game says it is loading, but crashes as soon as it returns to the mycareer main menu. Tell me if this has happened to you.
Please fix when I finish the playoff game or a playoff game closes out reset it and deleted and downloaded again still not working please fix major bug.
Kind of fun when it works but NBA mobile is still better graphics and play and free. This thing glitches and crashes like crazy
The game is fun but in my career you should catch ally oops cause if you can’t how do you play awsome as a center or small forward
Was fun a first but now there a so many glitches!
Can’t dunk no matter in practice or game
I like this game, but the one thing that is bothering me is that on my career, it is not showing me my averages, my ranks, and my team record. I don’t know if that is happening to anyone else. I don’t know what to do.
Camera needs work because when I’m on offense I want to see it from behind me from half court camera mode is all of them do this you see it in the back of the hoop and hard to see and makes me mad
First off I love the game! But it keeps crashing after games. Please fix this it is getting extremely annoying.
No way to turn off sound, no iPhone X support.
This is a good game, but I’ve noticed that some technical flaws. Whenever I play a game the right side of my screen glitches and puts a bunch of colors up on the screen like those technical difficulty signs.
I been playing and it is ticking me of that all the players photos are forms like six years ago
Everything is great I love it! I just wish there was an updated version for the IPhone X with a full screen 🤷🏻‍♂️ Hope that could change 👌🏻
My 2k glitches & says i average 0 points, rebounds, and assists. It says my team’s record is 0-0 but we’re 1-1. Only reason i haven’t been playing is because it glitches the same way my 2k17 did
I love this game much better than nba mobile but I hate my career mode because it won’t let me sweep nobody in a playoff series every time I win, it just freezes and exits me out of the game and I have to play again please fix this and I promise I will give you 5 stars. Oh and please add a head band bc I wand to give my played dreads and please let me change my commentator name because I don’t like my 6’8 small forward being called shorty
Don't waste your money the games are glitchy
The game immediately jumps to the edit my player screen on start up and won’t leave it. What a disappointment, I just wanted to play b-ball. Uninstalled, waste of money
This is an amazing game but I can’t save my progress I save it and I get on it the next morning then it takes me back to the start and I hate it it gets on my nerves so could you please fix this
This game has many pros but also has many cons. It is fun to play my career and blacktop modes just like you could on the console. But I have some complaints. First off, my career can be very frustrating because whenever you call for a pass (at least) 85% of the time it gives you a bad call for pass which hurts by grade, and sometimes even gives you excessive call for pass which lowers your grade even more. Also a bunch of times I throw a pass inside it is tipped and stolen, which is very frustrating because it never happens to any other players and hurts my grade. Secondly in my career, the game can be very glitchy and laggy. For example I am trying to pass the ball, but the game lags so I hit the pass button again, and it throws and alley oop to nobody. Very annoying! Finally my last complaint is that this game DRAINS your battery. I play this game for 20 minutes and my battery went from 80% to 60%. I like playing this game but not if it kills my battery
There are a lot of great things about this game. But the bad out weigh the good. First and worst thing is when using a Bluetooth controller, you can’t shoot free throws. This is huge. You can’t just shut the controller either. You have to reset the game which for obvious reasons makes playing anything other than streetball impossible. Because of this I give it one star. I just love the fact I spent money on a game I can’t even play.
I’m a fan of EA Sports and love NBA Live. I decided to try out 2K. I hated it. Graphics are horrible, none of the rules are accurate. I just dropped $5 down the drain for nothing
Please add native resolution for iPhone X ASAP
Cant donlode
Can you please give us a choice in what difficulty we want to play in mycareer please and when I play blacktop it’s usually for vc when I had 2K17 we could’ve gotten more vc for blacktop
Ever sense I made it to the playoffs the app has been crashing I’ll do the game do the post game interview and when it tries to save it CRASHES it’s so frustrating they don’t want me to get past round 2 😭 it happens every time I play on my career mode I’m struggling out here please help fix this problem
Worst control ever......
I love the game but, there are some bugs and glitches. 2k please add more jersey for each NBA team. Also, could u add at least a couple all time teams because I really want to play with kobe in quick game. I like all the new dunking animations, but could u add some better graphics for players faces. Thank you and keep up the good work. Also could u make some of the nba legends, be able to be added on an nba. I wanted to recreate the ‘04 Lakers with Kobe Bryant, Gary Payton, Karl Malone, Shaquille O’neal. Please make this an option
It wont download for me and i wasted my money
It’s a great game BUT every time I’m half way through career or association mode the came shut down and I can’t continue, twice on each.  I tried all that nonsense they tell u to do on support page...nothing. Tried contacting them....nothing. You spend a long time building ur player and half way through you can’t move further and force to start over. My second go through actually got far to the playoff then...shut down and can’t advance anymore. App constantly shut down and halfway through it stop completely. Don’t waste ur time and money on this game. If u see this review NBA2k18, fix ur crap before selling it to people.
It’s not letting me put a name on my player please help me or give me my money back
I like how they added the all time great teams and that kind of stuff, but there are a few super annoying problems. I like some players on the bench for certain teams, so I play with them a lot and I like to see their stats specifically for them personally. But I can’t access the bench scores and shows the points rounded up. I think that’s just stupid. The second and last complaint, is apparently 2K doesn’t know how to call backcourt violations. It is so annoying because I would be a good 5 feet in front of the line that’s separates the full court and half court line, than there would be a foul called. I get frustrated for these certain things and I am sure a lot of other people that play this game have this trouble too. Please fix this!!!
Mine is taking forever to download and I have the iPhone8 and I have my own wfi  But it is taking forever. 
Many other people have this problem. when you reach the playoffs after you finish a game and after the interview when you're about to go to the main mycareer page it crashes and the game you just played isn't saved. I can't continue playing mycareer now and that was basically all I did with this game. disappoinment.
First off the game is awesome! But something I would like to see change is in my career when you call for a pass and you’re wide open it shouldn’t be a bad pass call which takes away from the player grade for that game. I understand if I call for one when someone is in the paint making a move towards the basket. But not when a guard has dribbling in the same spot for 3 seconds and I’m wide open at the top of the key. Also when it’s late in the game and the other team presses and you’re open and call for a pass it hits with a bad pass every time that’s really frustrating!!! Also I would like to see an options to be able to call a timeout as a player in some situations before the end of the half I would like to advance it up the court then call a TO and get a in bound play in. Instead of running up the court with 10 seconds left and just throwing up a shot.  Association mode is awesome! But I don’t like that when you get 12 years or more in that rookies start out rated low 50’s some even in the 40’s. I’m not going to spend VC points to upgrade someone who is a 50 overall coming in it’s a waste of money and time. I would like to see a more fair rating coming in. The #1 - 4 pick were 60- high 70’s. But after that your in the 50’s the 5th pick shouldn’t be in the 50’s that’s unreal!!! Just stronger players coming in over the years would be nice! Other than that great game! 
I have 6gb available and still won’t download
Like it so far, but I cannot equip shoes that I brought it said “Equip Fail” need help please
It just needs to have IPhone X full screen
I like 2k sports because they make good quality games but my parents payed 5 dollars for NBA2K18 and I was exited to play it but when I downloaded it it says That it is unable to be downloaded at this time! I KNOW I have enough storage on my phone and I have a iPhone 6s and it is capable with it but I’ve tried for days and days and it will not work I’ve even tried restarting my phone HUNDREDS of times but it still doesn’t work PLEASE help me I really want to play this game Basketball is my favorite sport and I don’t want this app to steal my 5 dollars!
It says I don’t have enough storage but I’ve only use 9.8 gigs out of 16 meaning I have double the amount I need for the game to download
I an really loving this game but I just wanted to point out something. I have the Celtics selected as my team and whenever Kyrie Irving does something, the announcers call him Kevin Love.
So I had just saved my game, and before that I bought $19 dollars worth of vc to level up my player because I thought this game was worth the money. But after the saved that asked me to save on the progress on device or on iCloud I chose iCloud and when I went back to my career it brought me all the way to the beginning. I would love to get my refund or just fix the issue I have.
I bought 50,000 coin, I close the app and when i reopened it they were all gone I want my coins
The App Store should not be allowed to sell a game that does not work. It’s amazing how many errors and bugs there are. But most importantly I can’t even play a game. Every time I try, the game runs so slow that it’ll literally take 20 minutes to finish an 8 minute quarter. Then, say I happen to make it through that quarter (which I haven’t so far), the game crashes! Then I’m asked if I would like to resume the game I was just in and I select yes... Then it takes me back to the beginning of the game. What 2K is doing is criminal, it should be illegal. I want my money back!
Add online blacktop 3v3.  Online quick game. = Game Center 
When I play a my cheerier game it keeps on glitching ang there are different colour lines on my screen on the right side plz help
This 8 dollar game is a real pain. I cant seem to get passed the first game in the playoffs without it crashing and me having to play all over again. The game play its self seems rigged. Conveniently for some reason my team cant buy a basket usually in the 3rd Quarter once there is a huge lead. Not to mention it is super biased towards CPU...  In a nutshell u cant have crappy game play and glitches.  Choose a struggle 
Great game I like basketball
Tried deleting and re-downloading it multiple times, but the game keeps crashing.
I like the game but can you please make madden like this if you made madden have a career mode then it would be great plz I hope you read it thx
The game works perfectly fine until you get fouled and go to the free throw line. Then its just will not allow you to shoot your free throws. Please fix
Everything is fine before this update but now the app will crush as soon as I finish a game so I can never advance to another game
I love it, but there are many small problems and details that need to be added. First in the association mode if we’re doing a fantasy draft we should be able to skip the others team’s picks. It’s a waste of time waiting on others teams picks one at a time. We should also be able to add legendary players into regular rosters so that way we can play with them in Association. In MyPlayer mode I find it very annoying that my teammates can’t play without me being involved. I’ll pass the ball to them and they’ll just stand there until the shot clock is over. There should also be slightly more fouls being called. We should also be able to ask the coach to reduce our minutes or trade certain players like on the regular 2k. When it comes to the gameplay there’s a problem where if I pump fake and the defender jumps and tackles me down there’s no foul called which leads to a turnover by the ball handler. Besides that its a good game
Update the Pacers and King’s Home Courts please!
The game looks great in the previews but is a little different when you actually start to play. For one thing the shorts are still glued to the players pants and are not free flowing so to speak. Plus I fell in love when I say the preview and the fact that so many things are different in the actual gameplay is a little sad. I think that it’s still very similar to 2k16-17. I hope it changes. Let’s not be lazy 2K. Overall though it’s pretty good as far as the smoothness. But why so much space??? 😂 I hope some things change plz!!
Add In scrimmage mode with the practice would be all the game needs. Earn from your performance ??? Can you add it?
THIS GAME GLITCHES, MAKES MY PLAYER NOT MOVE, NOT SCORE, AND HAS JUST MADE ME WANT TO THROW MY I-PAD AGAINST THE WALL!!!!
It's really bad cause it takes up so much space and it's so much money. I played it and it's liked a rigged game that's really bad.
Hi my poop is coming out hard and rocky
I don't have 2k18 yet, but I'm loving it so far.
It makes my screen freeze. I’ll play and no less than a minute later my controls stop working. It won’t let me move and all the buttons on the right side of the screen stops. Needs to be fixed
I absolutely love nba 2K18 18 but every time I try to load my small forward account it turns off then when I try to load my other accounts I see them from the stands and can not control them same thing happens in nba 2K18 17 pls fix this 2K. I have it 3 out of 5 because I love the game but have some problems
It keep crashing during Playoff round 1 game 1.. not saving data. Needs improvement. However, I love this game.
Please make lower prices but it’s really fun please fix this
I bought the game today. I get on to play the gameplay is ruined by constant boxes of color and lag on the screen. It makes the game virtually impossible to play. Please fix!
This game has been very laggy and every time I try to play it kicks me out plz refund me
Ok 2k, so I already wrote a comment when the game came out. But I just want to mention again that the game is really good and no bugs at all. But as I mentioned in my last comment, if you can just add something like mypark/myplayground that they have in the consoles and the pro-am, the game would be at its prime. It will get five star ratings, get in 1st place in the top games on mobile chart, and everyone would want the game, also you’ll get more money. I think everyone would want that. I hop you do this in 2k19.
When I’m playing MyCarrer mode, I can’t shoot free throws . The game just glitch and doesn’t allow me to continue with the game unless I actually quit the game
...mycarry playoff!!!! 😡😡
In my career mode it always crashes after I finish games
I downloaded this app and payed for it and it did not load. This is not a problem with the phone it is a problem with the app but I like everything else.
Overall nba2k18 is an amazing game for mobile, but I have a couple of problems with my career. First, in the equipment section, there’s no arm Sleeves!!!Plus, my shooting is absouleuetly broken. I make everything. So please fix this and take this into concern
Ever since the latest update, it crashes after I finish a game in the playoffs. Not very happy. Otherwise it’s a good game all around so only 2 stars from me. Without the crashing I’d give it a 4.
I made sure I cleared up enough space and it still won’t download
I wish it didn’t take up so much storage
This game is great because I get more than 50 points almost every game but the problem is that my player is 6 foot 1 and he can't dunk even my 6 foot 8 player can't dunk really weird but my daddy helps me get a triple double I made a YouTube video on this game my dad helps me get 10 steals and 10 assists for a  triple double but it is super weird game well that is it wait one more thing the quick game mode is bad bad quick game mode the reason why is because it's a full quarter of the my career mode
Glitches
This is a good game but y’all need to add an online feather Whether is quick match or blacktop either one is good 
Great game but kicks me off every time I finish a game and won’t let me go on to the second round of the finals in my career mode
My 2k18 on iphone is crashing whencyou reach game 3 of the playoffs in the my career/my player i don’t know how to fix this. But it’s a good game tho
Whenever I play this game my phone heats up and the battery drains. I can’t play it.
The game is great. It isn't optimized for iPhone X so everything is a tad smaller and it's kind of annoying
Fun game, but we should be able to change the sliders and create a player would be really fun
I had this game at 5 stars but since the new update it crashes after every playoff game in mycareer without saving the game
Last game in my career mode Finals , it just still crashing after the interview 😡😡😡😡  FIX IT!!!!!!!!!  This is NOT FREE 
The lag is real and how do you miss greens how is that even possible
Can y’all please make an online black top mode in mycareer please? I really like the game play it daily I even brought it for my brother. I hope y’all respond back sincerely 2K18
Has anybody experience their phones heating up only when theyre playing 2k17 or 2k18? Im using an iphone 6s plus and even during the first few minutes of gametime, the phone is heating up. Have Never experienced that with any of my game apps.
2K did a great job with this game. They need to fix some bugs and a couple other problems. There is one thing that it would be nice if you added and that would be My Team and multiplayer included with that
Why is my update for this game not working?
I was playing the game in my career and it closed me out and i tried to load it back up to resume where I left off and it closed me back out I lost everything in my career on this game and the money I spent need to fix it or I need my money back
Crashes at the end of the game after the last update.
Can you guys please add my park
This is a good game but a lot of players are not on the team their supposed to be on like Carmelo Anthony he’s still on the Knicks
I would deff pay an additional 9 dollars just to play online with other people and via Bluetooth and also replay. Other than tht this game is perfect! Much update from 17 and love that u can change the duration of minutes of the quarters in my career mode. Graphics is amazing the game play is the best this game is 85 percent to get it to a 100 those 2 things
The new update is good, updates rosters and brings some new stuff. It would be great to add an update to make the game compatible with the iPhone X. My career is broken, when I finish a game it just crashes. So I’m basically stuck on the same game for a week now
It’s a good game but I wish it was compatible the my iPhone X screen. If it were, It would be a 5 star
Amazing game and graphics! Add online multiplayer and i have the 8 plus and just bought this game! 3rd day playing it! Why is it crashing every time i open it now!!! Fix this $8 for a game on my phone and its crashing? Come on
2/5 Stars until they fix this issue with the crashing. 👎🏽👎🏽 I should get my $50 I’ve spent making my player a 95 back!!
I enjoy the game a lot but the only thing I dislike is even though you get a perfect timed shot and the shot meter turns green, half the time you still miss which doesn’t make any sense
Won’t let me finish my career
I like this game but it will be better with online service like mypark
How is it that I pay for this and it’s glitching worse than a free game?  I finally won the championship and the game won’t pass the last game??? So basically I have to keep playing the game over to see if it makes me progress and no results but the same game 7 
During career mode the game keeps crashing.
I bought a $50.00 coin pack and it didn’t go threw but it took my money so I tried again so I bought it two times and it took $50.00 more dollars and I didn’t get the coins
Unreal. Paid good money for this game and it is not formatted for the new iPhone. Update 2: it’s been updated twice and STILL NO iPhone X screen support. Disappointed. 
Would be a great game but whenever I get on association and attempt to trade, scout, or resign anyone it crashes.
I cant even download it ,it gets to about 2/3 done then stops 😡😡😡
Mehn whats going on with the app?since i play the first round of my play off game I can’t continue to the next round app keep crashing
I love NBA 2K18, generally speaking the game has a lot of fun factor. But what bothers me is it’s not compatible with iPhone X please update ASAP, then it would be perfect!
This game was built to screw plAyers over. The amount of bias it has for the CPU over the player is unbelievable. How is it that the AIs on the CPU team are super intelligent but the AI on the player’s team are dumb as hell and have the reaction speed of a sloth? I have guys standing out of bounds when I’m trying to run a set play and they don’t even bother to hustle after loose balls. It is completely ridiculous how the CPU can make jumpers from half court and the officiating is just BS on this game. I lost a guy to injury for driving into the paint and he absolutely got pummeled without a foul call. The screens that the CPU set on this game completely knocks my player to the ground while the screens I try to set don’t even have any effect on the opposing player. If the developers of this game weren’t so fixated on the money they’re making, they would fix this BS.
Device died in the middle of a game and now can’t even open the app because it crashes. Please fix this issue.
Honesty I would like to see on the main menus practice mode too . Like if u practice with just your player or a specific player or with your team in practice scrimmaging . And black top more maps, and make it like my park on console . Due to more customizations on my player different clothes and accessories please . Because when u use your player in my park he just get a boring black shirt .  I love this game , sometimes it makes me forget that I have it on console. So please come up with a new update. Everyone would love this sooooooo please
Keeps crashing when I finish a game and after the interview
I didn’t pay 7.99 so that when I want to change my camera and controller settings it just turns off. This really needs to be fixed  Update :  Why I’m career mode I’m still at 5-4 on my record when I’ve played way more games. Please fix this 
This is a good game but I have some problems with it. 1st is the crashing, especially in Association mode. 2nd is not being able to have all time teams in association mode. 3rd is not being able to change the all time teams. For example I want to be able to put Magic MJ LBJ Duncan and Kareem all on the same team. 4 I think you should add specific teams. Example: 1987 Lakers or 1965 Celtics or 2013 Heat. I also want to have Decade Teams. Example: 2000's Nash, Kobe, TMac, Duncan, and Shaq. But overall great game.
I’ve seen other comments about a bug when you get into the playoffs and play a game, the game crashes after the interview while loading the my career screen. I contacted customer support and they weren’t helpful at all. They just pointed to a troubleshooting page that didn’t solve the problem. I’m in game three of the finals and just want to finish the season. I would think a large company like 2K would do better than this. Once they have your money they don’t care about your experience.
Career mode seems to be crashing during playoffs. I’ll finish the playoff game, do the interview, and it crashes. I paid to play the mycareer and it’s sad that I won’t be able to see that ring😔
Great game, awesome gameplay but every time I play a game and finish and do the interview the app crashes so I’m forced to play that game (my player) again and again with no progress at all, it would be nice if y’all can see if that’s a bug or something, but great game I love it, I wish I can get back to it
I just bought this game for career and I beat Wayne Ellington in the beginning and when I press quit after it nothing happens!
The game needs to run a lot smoother it lags a little. And add a my team like the Xbox one and PS4 and  add where you can play online with people.
You guys need to please make a my park mode or multiplayer mode to play with friends
Since last update, I play a game in Career mode and then crashes. Is not even funny, please see this ASAP. We pay $7.99 to be able to play without crashing on us.
I have been playing for11 Year’s and they’re still is no mypark if there was this game would be 5 star.
This game is good, but it can be even better when they have the player meet with the GM in a different place other than the office. Also, it should be updated where you win MVP of some sort of any championship, the player should be able to give a speech on what he thinks of why he won it. Just like at the end of every game.
Plz add online like 1v1 for your myplayer it would make this game soooo good plz!!!
Another update, another bad bug
Umm I just got a few suggestions can we get a multiplayer mode so we can play with others who have the game and maybe like side videos of our myplayers interacting with the endorsements connections and a transfer option if users have a ps4 or Xbox to upload there myplayer to 2K18 on ps4 or xbox ... but I’m loving the game keep up the good work...... my carrier crashes after game now
Keeps crashing during playoff run in My Career, please fix. Thanks TD
I added 2 stars based on the last update from my initial review. Thank you for finally adding a shoot around mode! Let’s fix the equipment and add the controls and we will be in business. The following issues prevent this game from being 5 stars but it is definitely a move in the right direction.  First. Contact fouls are simply not being called. They are broken! I literally knock over an opposing player and fouls are not called.   1. Customize weight, college for mycareer!  2.the grotesque equipment! No NBA player would be caught dead with those cartoonish armbands and leg-bands! This is infuriating because you added agents and social media but couldn’t fix this. Why not just have sleeves, shirts, and headbands? How hard is that?!  3.Stop scamming me on free throw purchases! I should be able to see the full animation without purchasing it. 4.The computer can clearly perform console moves I can’t (flashy passes, fake passes, play calling). This should be incorporated for us Bluetooth joystick users. 5. What good is a slasher or athletic finisher if I can’t call for an alley oop? Please incorporate this. 
After last update the game crashes after I complete a game, and then after to replay the game. Please fix the bug(s).
After my 20th season I was forced to retire and now every time I open career mode the app crashes. Please advise.
My career is way too easy, I’m scoring 65.4 ppg and averaging 11 assists, 10.3 steals and 6 rebounds and constantly beat teams by 25+
In my career mode, the game keeps crashing after the interview but before it can save. I’ve played the same game four times but can’t get past the interview!!!
This game is really fun but I wish there was more story mode and cut scenes and when you play franchise there should be player lock so we can stay as one player
Game constantly crashes. My reviews have never been taken into account. Support desk is no help and never resolved my issues. Let alone paying extra money to boost myplayer attributes. What a waste, booo
When Kyrie gets the rebound they say “Rebounded by Kevin Love” please fix it. It throws the game off a bit, other than that the game is good. Also add more game modes like Multiplayer.
I purchased 20,000 coins and it disappeared and never gave me my money back. Give me my money back or get it fixed.
The game starts off with creating your own my career player which is you and makes his or her way all the way to the NBA.This game is almost as good as the real 2k you would play on ps4 or Xbox.you can play with greats like MJ and Iverson on Blacktop. There is so much depth in Association mode. There is even a quick game option if u r in the hurry
Keeps crashing whenever I’m done with the interview in my career mode. I hate it. Fix it please
I can’t play this game in career mode after the last update. Just started with first play-off game, and as soon as I finish it, game crashes. I tried to save the game before the match ended hoping this will bypass the crashing problem, but sadly without any result. This happens every time when the match is finished and game tries to save the progress after post-game interview. Since I played this game 95% because of the career mode, I will delete it because I find it useless now. What a waste of time...
Stop taking my storage please help me god
Great game app, unacceptable downloading time. When I’m connecting my WiFi or personal hotspot.downloading seems time consuming. Tried overnight downloading outcome pointless! Having paid for this app I’m disappointed
Great game love everything about it expect after I win a championship or make a trade the game will freeze and cut off leaving me back at the home screen.
Good game but keeps on crashing
I have been playing mobile 2k since 2k11 and have seen many improvements. I really enjoyed association mode this year and I am obsessed with mycareer. Despite the good game there need to be some improvements             First, mycareer need some finishing touches big time. First the pass system is broken I am the best player on my team, sharpshooters, and scoring 42 ppg and when I am wide open and call for pass I get bad call and excessive call which mess up the grade a lot. Also you can not call for alley oops             In association mode you can’t resign players. This cause me to go from champion to 6 players on the team To a bunch of 60 overalls on my team this causes me to stop playing some. I also wish that you could add in some of the cool features we get on console. Because right now this is Not Close to console version         I hope you take this review and use some of it in the next updates or even 2k19. I have been a loyal 2k fan for now 7 years and hope you take account to my review. I believe with these edits and a few more this would become #1 on top charts. I already love this game and hope you use some of my suggestions. No hate though. Thank you for great games each year 2K 
I got to the final game of the season and it keeps closing out won’t let me play. Please fix
Multiplayer it would be the best game ever
I’m having troubles saving my game, this game is wounderful, love practice mode !!!! My games is saying iCloud failure everytime I save and it’s taking up space on my device . I would love to be able to play my own music during the practice and free time also how do I dunk ? I’ll try looking again . We should be able to turn it down in the game.                                   Thank you for your time, Iesha Wilson 
This game is the best 2k game yet. It has the best MyCarrer in 2k history.
Just finished a game in my career and it won’t let me advance. It says I need to finish previous day which has already been done
Really great game I only have one suggestion Can we make it so we can permanently set which type of controller we like? I personally always get confused and frustrated with the new controller. 
Can you add a my team mode for the mobile versions That would be nice, and can you add more association settings like when I do fantasy draft I wanna be able to have my team go first and can you throw some legends into the fantasy draft on association. Can you guys also add 2K18 beats customized so I can choose which songs on the game I want to listen too and the ones I don’t. Please and thank you.👍
The game is obviously very good. However, it still does not support the best graphic quality in iPad Pro 10.5 inch version. It supports good graphics quality in iPhone6s which was launched earlier than the 10.5 iPad Pro. Also , it seems that iPhone X is still not supported. These updates can lead us to a greater in game experience. Some rookies in the 2016 draft has random heads which also need urgently updated.  Looking forward to hearing from you. All the best 
This game would be full 5 rating but I can’t dunk instead I do a stop and pop shot every time
Can anyone tell me how to switch jersey in my career mode?
Update it every two weeks.
The game is amazing the new practice feature is amazing but in Mycareer you should add and option where you can talk to the GM like in the past games
This game wouldn’t even open. Whenever I tried to open it it would immediately close and bring me back to the home screen. This was a waist of 8 dollars!
Any other game mode I play doesn’t force quit. But when I play a my career game it tries to save and then force quits.
This game is awesome for a mobile game. I just want to say that when I was playing association mode I didn’t count my wins and loses.
Best game made hands down 🙌🏾 just a couple fixes and this game will be perfect like the players names don’t match the person
I absolutely love this game.the graphics are significantly great and it blew my mind with the reality.5 stars
I love this game thanks for adding legend mode thing shoots round your doing so good 2k that you should ad the Xbox one version of his my gym 🤩
It’d be nice if you could do a NFL2K18. The same concept except football. You could play as mycarrer and pick which position you would want to be. Just a suggestion...
This Game Is Amazing But There Is Two Reasons I Don’t Like It. One It Wastes Your Battery Quickly So You Need To Play With Your Device Plugged In. Two Sometimes It Glitches When You Hit Pass Sometimes It Just Throws It At The Hoop
we need more shoes an the crowd is a little on low graphics can you fix that by making a graphics mode
It some times get really boring
Same thing every year. Change some colors and call it a new one.🤢 I'm wondering how many people are there in the development team for this game? My guess is one or two🙄🙄🙄 Or you are THAT lazy. Or just useless. Hire more SKILLFUL people 2K, you know you got rich from that 2k18 PC/console ripoff crap.
By far this is the greatest game I’ve ever played on any phone and I spent tons of money on this game but my issue is every time I play the first game in the playoffs the game ends I select end game then it loads and before it saves my progress the game crashes every time this happened multiple times please fix this!!!!!!!
Game froze or exit out to homescreen during the saving of finished game in myCareer and game isn’t saved.
The App Store says my IPad is compatible with the game, but whenever I am done customizing my MyPlayer and I get to the name part, the game freezes and I have to reload the game. After I do that, it freezes again on the name part and it keeps happening, so please make an update. This game was 8 dollars and I don’t want to waste my money.
Game good. Very nice playing. Game 5 star.
In my league you give us the re sign date but there is no way to re sign any players so they always end up in free agency. There needs to be an added option on the menu screen to re sign players.
But one problem why can’t I choose my own weight? On my career please fix
Has too many kicked ball violations, game crashes and I have to delete the app and download  it again, unrealistic shots, many glitches
You guys should add a instant replay when you pause the game and you can look back what you or your teammates did in the game. Plus you should add more shoes like, Nike, Jordan, adidas, and yeezys I think people would love to see that. Plus, add some arm  sleeves long and short. Also, you should fix the wins and loses in my career I won many games but it says 5-2 even though I won more games than that. Add some leg sleeves long and short. You should add taunts so that your player or the computer players can react to it. When you get to halftime in the game it shows you your stats but it doesn’t show you highlights, I think it should show highlights in halftime. Add a nickname change and the city you are born in system.
There are times when my player is defending another opponent and when my player literally jumps on top of them it’s not called.
Finally the old school teams
I play career mode and have finally gotten through all of the regular season games. Now after game 1 of the the first game in the playoffs the app shuts out after the interview portion and I have to play game 1 all over again this has happened multiple times now, id appreciate a fix seeing how I’m playing this on the iPhone X and payed $8 for it like everyone else
Can i get some sleeve and leg sleeve i want to be cool
Every time I finish a game in MyCareer. It just freeze and go back to my home screen and it didn’t save.
First and foremost I would like to say I Love this Game. It is over the top for a iPhone game. Graphics, Speed and total realistically as close as the game can be.Now back to the Flaws about the Game... Playoff time it keeps crashing after the first two games of the second round! Why? Can someone please explain this Flaw to me.
Love this game
2k pls add online mode I wanna play against others so bad and I’m sure everyone else wants to. I want to play against my brother because he have this game as well so pls add it.
The stats are a problem come on man the stats are always get stuck please fix them otherwise great game.
This game is so awesome and fun I am a really big basketball fan I play this all the time every day funniest game and my favorite game I have ever played just the record for the teams get stuck
2Ks entire busses is a scam and is not worth near 8 dollars it has so many glitches and it is completely unrealistic. In other words pretty similar to anything else they’ve ever made.
Only thing left to add is a play online game mode and this will be the best basketball game on the App Store!!!!
How do I access spectator mode????
Can you release a update that would allow us to play against each other on Bluetooth/WiFi . Please ! That would be clutch .
As much as I love the content of this game, the creators really need to focus on keeping this game up to date with: - 2k16 control Shooting Delay - iPhone X full screen  Fix that and this game is instantly a five star app. 
Please put legend teams in Association! This will make it the best game ever!!
We should be able to make a custom jumpshot, etc and haircuts, just a suggestion🤷🏾‍♂️ then I’d use all my iTunes money on this game.
Thanks for the new update. When do you think you will give us hall of fame badges?
Can you plz make it to where you can have 4-5 minutes quarters in the career mode. And make it to where you can have head bands and realistic player accessories. And thanks for the update my game crashed now everytime it saves after a game finishes.
It’s good game tbh, and it’s better than the 2K17 I love it
I absolutely love this game! I find myself playing it almost every day. But there is just one thing that has been irritating. In the Association and the MyCareer feature, stats and win loss record seem to be stuck. It says my team in the association feature is 12-4 even though I have played 43 games. In MyCareer it says 20-0 when I’ve played 30 games. This is the only thing missing that has negatively changed my experience
Please add the players name being said after they score.
Favorite game that I play constantly until I got my iPhone X. Needs to be updated to at least fill more of the screen... what a waste.
plz support big screen n iphone x plzzz
Please add all those guys from All Time teams to Blacktop. This game will be literally perfect🌈
love nba2k
It is a great game.but it will not load. It finally loaded then it wouldn’t not let me on. I would click on it and it go on it for 5 secs then take me to the home screen.i started my career and then it sent me to the home screen and said the game was loading
First of all many players that are on the actual nba roster are missing from the game. Stats won’t change after 3 games(My team has been 3-0 and we are nearing the end of the season. I’m tired of seeing this interface, it’s years old. And if there are no updates. You guys should just all together stop releasing mobile games. P.S. the console version is lacking as well. You guys honestly should scrap the whole my career feature for mobile and just have an online play option for myplayers (throwing a name out there: MyPlayerMobile). And just have servers to back it up. This sounds like a great idea as far as monetary gains, because everyone will pay to buff their MyPlayer stats (but there should still be an option to do so without paying) I just rather you guys try something different than seeing next year’s mobile 2K18 with a 2k14 interface😞😒
It's like watching a game on TV. Wow. It's that authentic.
Crashes mid game tons of glitches...lot of bugs that need to be fixed.
I have played this game for 2 days and it is the best basketball game ever. The graphics are amazing and the controls are very responsive. Also the my career mode is just too good. It is very realistic to. My only complaint is that it says that I have to connect to WiFi to save on iCloud when I am! If you guys(app developers) can fix that one bug it will be the best game in the world.
Needs roster update
I paid $8 for the game thing it would be fun to play but when I bought it, It didn’t load. My WiFi was fine and I tried different thing to make it load but they didn’t work. When ever the game ever got to the installing faze, it would stop and tell me that it can’t download. Waste of money so far. If you can help, please respond.
I like everything about this game! However, the soundtrack could use some work. Besides that, the gameplay is great and the graphics have gotten way better from past years.
The gameplay is good but there are some glitches and some bad controls.First off,if you want an alley oop.You have to pass it backwards or somewhere random,it might happen random though when you pass.Also,I got glitched to OVR 62 randomly.Over all,the gameplay is great!
Keeps closing when i try to play my career
I can’t download it for some reason and it took my money so do not buy it.
I really enjoy this game but the reason I won’t give it a five star rating because it has a lot of things that don’t work. Like for example the commentators will sometimes say a player from another team even though he’s not with that team or just not say the right player. Another example is that sometimes you can’t even look at the stats from your player in mycareer mode. There’s a lot of issues that it has but I still play the game. Sometimes like it would be great to actually get like all these issues and problems and fix them. So until the problems and issues are fixed I won’t give it a five star rating
The game lags very very very badly and the settings are stupid you can’t even edit the button layout.
Best game ever I got it for Lonzo ball but I saw the graphics and was like these are 🔥 love it everyone is on the right team love it 5/5 for me
So I just finished winning the first round of playoffs, but there are no more matches or teams to play for the second round of the playoffs, my “calendar” doesn’t show anything past Apr 24, please fix this! I wanna keep playing in the playoffs!
I've never played a game filled with more bugs. Doesn't remember your audio settings (for some reason turning your phone on silent doesn't work like it does on every other app), touch isn't accurate, player movement is jerky, buttons don't work sometimes, etc. Just constant problems that have somehow gotten worse since previous iterations.
I keep getting notified that the game has been updated but the rosters have stayed the same for a while now! Bledsoe is still on the suns for Pete’s sake!  PLEASE fix the big issue of many of the 2016-17 rookies (as well as some other players) not looking anything like their real life counterparts and having generic player models. Examples (Malcolm Brogdon, Ivica Zubac, Damien Wilkins, Marquese Chriss, etc ). Also Jarrett Jack is missing and so are some free agents like Josh Smith and other players overseas who could sign in the nba later. 
You might need to fix them but other wise the game is good
The game I like one of the best game on the iOS but then only thing that is missing is online
It won’t download so don’t get it
The gameplay itself is good, some bugs on the player models and their gear/jerseys though.   My biggest problems are with the grammar errors, simulator errors, and unintuitive interface in “The Association”mode. #1 issue preventing me from playing: unrealistic contracts. Also, the fact that you just randomly lose players in the off-season with no warning. Please fix, for your customers.  Also, the iPhone X should have support at this point. Don’t be intimidated by the notch or the different aspect ratio; use it to your advantage. 
It will not load
Can we please get New Jersey’s like update them to be like the new alternate jerseys from this year that would make the game a lot more better
Decent game with nice graphics for a cellphone. Still kind of underwhelming

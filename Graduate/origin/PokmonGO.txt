This game is so much fun and so incredibly frustrating at times. I just spent time fighting a gym and all of a sudden I can't finish it off. It goes to the "GO!" animation and kicks me out. "Error (29)" pops up at the top of the screen. That's the third time that has happened this week alone.
It won't let me sign up and then login it won't let me please make it so you do t have to log in
the game is also gym free
Well internet explorer has now been dethroned as king of pop ups. I use to love this game but now I spend so much time trying to close redundant pop ups about the weather, it's no longer fun to run. Maybe I'll play again once they release a pop up blocker for this game.   RIP Lv. 32 
Last update has been crashing when feeding Pokémon in gym. I had to reinstall.
I think it’s underrated. Sure, it’s old, but come on! It’s an awesome game that deserves recognition. Probably the closet we’ve gotten to real life Pokémon yet. :)
I throughly enjoy this game.
Totally not worth playing when people can cheat and spoof and knock out gyms seconds after actually working to take them out. Nor when they can spoof to fing England for regionals and have every pokemon the literal day it comes out. Don’t bother wasting money for all you need to do is cheat apparently.
Since the last update has become unplayable if I click a gym to either put Pokémon in or feed the ones already in a gym. Freezes every time.  iPhone X.   iOS 11.2.6 
Hi
I love this game! I would play on my ds and dream of how Pokémon would have been if it was real. But thanks to you my dream came true! I just have one question....when is mega evolutions coming to the game? But other than that thank you so much!!!!!
sometimes worth it, doesnt balance out the headaches when it doesnt work
You need trading
Hi
I spoof. Subscribe to FsuAtl
Great, great game but needs to add trading, and maybe selling our items for pokecoins
I feel like when you join a team you get a FREE shirt or sweater.
I personally love this game and I think the reason I love it is cause I live next to a park and the game is pretty easy for me considering the fact that I use discord and in discord we have a channel called Bay Area Pokémon go where there are different channels in it so if you live in San Ramon or Danville you use the Danville San Ramon Chanel where we schedule raids and you rsvp it’s very helpful and let’s me connect with people but I think that for people who don’t use discord they may not have that much fun so I think that if you add trading or gifts that would be cool for instance take notes  (If you use what they use with email where you type in a name and they show up what you could do is have a player send a gift or trade request to other players via email in the game)  Here’s how it would work  Gifts : a player could select Pokémon on there account and type in the username of another account then the other person ( the person receiving the Pokémon can except or Denys the gift via in game email  Trading: a trainer can type in another trainers username and see there Pokémon they could then tap on Pokémon hit next ( which would be in a corner sending them to there Pokémon) where they would tap on the Pokémon that they want to trade the other trainer will get this request and rather accept or deny the trade  So maybe I’m one of the next updates we will see trading and I think that this is the way to do it 
2018 Update: 2 years later I download this game again because I'm curious to see all the new progress it should have but was greeted with network interruptions and try again later screens when accessing the pokestops.  2016 This game when it first launched was just fine then slowly with every update it got worse and worse. Now it's easier to catch a rate Pokémon level 600 than to catch a normal rat or bird level 100. The curve balls barely work and most of the time don't even curve anymore and the great or elite balls are weaker than the normal Pokémon balls. A total screw up and I will never pay a single penny towards this game nor waste my time playing it. 
I love playing this game and catching Pokémon while I walk the dog however. It freezes very often and every time I give my Pokémon a berry it crashes. Very frustrating. Please improve this!
The game has had its ups and downs, but as it stands it has been consistently good lately. Events have breathed life back into the game. The inability to actually track Pokémon still is disappointing, but as it stands I am content with the state of the game.   Can’t wait for more shiny mons. 
I think Pokémon go is a good game because you get to go out and make new friends and hang out
Guys this game is only about money anymore if you are Pokémon lover play gba games that I recommend to you.couse you run for the game you spend your time for it walk for specific places and you got noting.they don’t want you have anything they want you spend more and more money to be in the game.this game is a insult for Pokémon’s name.gyms are ugly there is noting to do with Pokémon.go attack to gym which has 6 Pokémon in.after that just do same moves for every Pokémon but hit dif. Skills. Seriously awful.an other thing let’s say you see a raid 5 stars you find people with you go there spend you time and money again.wait there in cold or in hot 10 people and after that even if you beat the Pokémon you are not be able to catch it why because you are not important you are just slave for this game because this is only game about Pokémon which is global and new.no way it is your slave.dont let this game control you.if you can’t stop playing spend like me 500 dollars and you gonna see you have noting special.you have the same thing everybody does.becouse even you spend you can’t.so pls don’t play this ugly ugly game
I love this game but I Think you guys should make an Update where you have a Snorlax Week where you can catch Snorlaxs for one week please do my idea I think everyone would love it it is still a great game it’s very fun and addicting. Great work on the game
ok so the now after i deleted the app and redownloading it, it says unable to authenticate for my trainer account. additionally i have written it down before any of this happened. i love this app but you already know that niamtic sense you fixed the past problems i had. I now just am worried that because i didn't download the app from the cloud that my trainer account is gone. i needs the Halps.?!!
Why do the pokemon disappear for 5 seconds every single time you open the app?
Don’t work
I keep dropping Pokemon in gyms they stay more than 24 hours in the gyms when they get back I'm supposed to receive poke coins I noticed I have not been getting the poke coins.I contacted niantic multiple times and got no response.
Ever find yourself betrayed by a promise? This game takes the cake in promising pvp and trading: it’s never coming so if you missed out on exclusive mons, you’re S.O.L. Also still too many problems period like rural players not getting spawns AT ALL. Wanna catch something rare like a legendary? Oops too bad, you'll never catch it with a 2-3% catch rate no matter how many balls you have or how many times you have PRACTICED. Me? Paying for a pass that may have A SLIM chance of catching a legendary? Pffft. Even with the free raid pass I still won’t be able to get it and I DO TRY HARD enough to throw a perfect curve ball.
Changes don’t come fast enough. It’s unreasonably hard to catch simple Pokémon. You can’t hardly catch Rare Pokémon anymore you have to play raids which aren’t solo friendly.
It’s really fun but it’s annoying when you run out of poke balls and you can’t catch Pokémon in your neighborhood.
I love Pokémon, so I like the idea of this game, just please fix the errors! Network errors! The glitching! The freezing! GPS errors! And make this game a little more fair! For god sakes you guys have a huge fan base stop trynna scheme,It’s annoying please do something about it, that’s why I give the rate 2 stars!
Every time I go to upgrade my Pokémon it says network error AT&T says it’s not them it’s the app and every time I try to upgrade it doesn’t work but it subtracts the candy and it stop me from catching a shiny magic carp and took 212 magic carp candies
I love this game soooo much!! But on thing I would love is all of the Eevee lutions to be added , like Sylveon and Leafeon. Maybe I missed an article but I haven’t seen how to make Eevee turn in to it sooo. Yeah thanks so much if you read this.
Lately, the game stop running more and more on iPhone X. Every update getting worse and worse. Need fixing.
I bought 3 of the boxes with the ultra balls the day they were available. Would have bought again but boxes were replaced with the usual raid boxes. I don’t have anyone to raid with and have too many raid passes and potions & such. How about offering a box, regularly, aimed  at non-raiders that has  like ultra balls, lucky eggs, berries, ultra incubators & such. I can’t be the only player that buys them.  Fixed login problem. Thx!  I'm lame, walk very slowly & stop often. I keep getting the message "you're going too fast." Right. Whatever you use, obviously not changes to gps, doesn't work for handicapped folks. This seems a bug that could be fixed.  Just saying. My son tells me this message is sort of a can't connect message now. At least the app now functions in I'm a passenger mode. Thanks!   The newish gym rules that allow more of us to participate in defending gyms are great. But berries are acquired generally one at a time every few pokestops. And golden raspberries almost never...maybe when winning a raid. I use up all my raspberries without making my Pokémon that much stronger. How about selling raspberries, particularly golden ones in the store. 
Pokémon go is a great app but when it first came out there was a video explaining it. In the video it shows people trading, but a year later there still is not trading!!! This feature would be cool because all of my friends that play are like “ when trading comes out I will give you one” but it’s still not out!!! Niantic if your reading this please work on trading!!!!!!!
I have been trying to not only get my account to login, but also make a new one. Neither of these things would work no matter how many emails I used, or how many different passwords I tried; I even got out my computer to verify my new account, and this preposterous app still would not function properly. A common folk would assume this app would function to my already very low standards. No. This app wasted my time, and my phone’s storage.
Try getting Ex-Raid passes when they “updated their system,” but they didn’t upadate their system. Put in time and you may get screwed. I asked them for compensation for lying about the new system being in place as I used plenty of time and gas daily to visit ex-raid gyms and yet, for the 4th time in a row, I did not get an ex-raid pass. Now I have one since the update is actually in place, but still, it’s complete bs. If you contact their support, they only provide generic robotic responses. No compassion, no help. If you get screwed by the system that they say is in place, but is not in place, you’re screwed. 100% not spending anymore money on Nintendo and Niantic products entirely.
Better have a control can move last 1km it’s best. How can I add gym in areas???any1 know???
I think the game is amazing. I also believe the premium stuff should be a little better. Buying regular pokeballs is crud, we should be paying for ultraballs. I’d also prefer 20hyper potions to 10max potions. One more suggestion is creating a Pokémon Go Plus extension for smart watches. I get y’all greedy and what-not so just make it a thing to purchase instead making us buying that ugly Go Plus watch. 
If someone puts a Pokémon in each gym, they should get paid for defending, without a coin cap.
you need to fix your issues soon! i get the dreaded pokeball glitch again and on top of that i was trying to catch a pikachu and it said marill fled!!!!
Hi there I just don’t know wiy is going good hope you had such a
Our area is very small and we don’t have any sponsored stops. So out only real chance at an exraid would be parks, but the parks in our area weren’t marked as parks when u changed the map from google to osm. It’s changed now but I guess u haven’t updated the maps on ur end! That is an easy fix that u are very capable of doing! And it would help a lot of people. The ex raid system is so messed up and if ur not gonna change it the least u could do is update ur maps. I love his game and play daily but it’s frustrating that ur dropping the ball when it comes to these exraids. Please please please please update ur maps!!!
I never realized how little there was to customize your trainer in the game. But I love how they are adding more stuff and giving you challenges to get them. It’s a great way to keep us incentivized. I want more options though. I would love to just have a white T-shirt that I could put the mystic logo on or a pokeball. Have a shirt and hoodie option that’s blank that you pay for whatever color you want then let us pay for whatever logo you want to put on it. That would be so awesome. Just a suggestion. I love the game and can’t wait to hit lvl 30 in a few weeks!
Love it!!! And I’m like so addicted, but I would love it if u could trade with other players by like typing in their nickname and then choosing the Pokémon u want to trade with. Or by like meeting up with another player and then trading...I don’t know. Anyway awesome game and so addictive!
Make a version that doesn’t use data/internet and supports the iPad or iPod.
The glitch is getting worse every time l play.
Since the new update, I’ve had more Pokémon flee than I’ve caught. Wasting up to 10 balls just for it to run away. This was a terrible idea, and it’s really made me not want to play anymore.
Two words:  TRADING POKÉMON
Your network errors are continuously cost me balls, raspberries etc. They have cost me money with these losts
The additions of Hoenn Pokemon and weather effects are nice additions to a game that is as flawed as it is fun.  Serious glitches include but are not limited to: app freezing while loading a gym, missing attack animations, gym tile images not loading, raid battles ending with several seconds left on the clock, and (of course) random crashes. 
On community day a lot of people in the world had state cup Soccer and other sports in the US. While my friends and I played our soccer game we missed community day completely!😡 it really was timed wrong for a lot of people and kids please redo community day
Mewtwo raid pass everyone caught but me, pokestops give me a hard time, gyms are terrible with loading up if you don’t have 100% full signal, takes 25 poke balls with golden berries to catch a pikachu, only thing ever around me is rattata or hoppip or pidgey. If you want to get max level, well you might by the time your 90 years old who knows.. walk 800 miles to get a egg to hatch yay! Raids don’t tell you if there are people there already so good luck beating one over 2 stars. The community days are a joke even if you go to a public park you might catch 30 Pokémon. I’m done with this game I’m going to play a real game PEACE!
Pokémon go needs a trading system where  trainers (players) can trade each other’s Pokémon from a distance. Also make the Pokémon consumable for different types of Pokémon instead of individual Pokémon.
This game was worth it when it first came out and absolutely fun, fun, fun until niantic had to make changes due to the player’s tendency to play it moronically. Niantic’s team is absolutely unresponsive, greedy and absolutely unfair towards the players as well and the connection to the game is completely faulty. It was fun until it lasted, but I really don’t think I’ll play this game ever again. Terrible.
Love this game but it freezes up too much on my Apple phone always have issues of some kind on my Apple phone. Right now I’m having freezing issues every time I interact with a gym ,hopefully this will get fixed soon other than that this is the greatest game ever made on a phone!
They make a dumb event where you can get a worthless pikachu with a party hat and they keep the dumb pikachu spam spawning for days. But when they do a Dratini spam spawn event, it only last 3 hours? I missed the whole event while I was at work. This game is still just a cash grab.
Some require 100 or 400 candies to evolve or power up this is entirely to many. There should be a way to transfer candies from Pokémon that do not evolve to some with this high requirement. Even if it is just a allowance of 50 to 75 between certain categories of Pokémon 
App fully updated. New battery. Run every troubleshooting tip. And if that doesn’t work—click here to contact us—which leads you back to the troubleshooting tips that, as noted before, DO NOT WORK.  I want my money back for this useless device. 
It’s incredibly fun but please developers, please make trading possible!! That was one of the best features of Pokemon. Why is this not available yet, how hard is it?
I regret spending money on this game. I walked 10km to hatch an egg and the game glitches and didn’t give it to me. This has happened several times. Also the game freezes almost constantly. I WANT MY MONEY BACK.
Game was working fine until I got a new phone. Listening to Audible on an iPhone X using AirPods, this game is barely playable. Clicking on a gym either locks up the app or takes 10-15 seconds to open. I take the light rail to work, but the app forces my avatar to side roads so I miss many gyms at at the train stops. What happened!?!
When it first came out, there were footprints based on how close it was, and you could hunt the Pokémon as the footprints increased or decreased.  Now you’re just wondering around hoping to stumble into one.  It can show the closest one as closest as you walk for a mile without ever seeing it, or it changing.  At first my daughter wanted to walk and play every day, ow we just occasionally turn  it on.   Far less fun in the suburbs than for those in cities. 
This game makes me excited to go out and walk with my dog. Me and my brother like to go to our local towns after school.
I’ve been having issues with catching Pokémon when my avatar is out of the vicinity of a Pokémon. They always run away whether I’m manually throwing or using my Go+. If I’m out for a jog, riding my bike or taking the bus to work/school it’s become practically impossible to catch anything. I literally have to be standing still to do anything in this game.   Please fix your location/speed issues! We enjoy playing your game, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to do so.   Pokémon should appear and stay visible in my immediate area while playing the game. The app should stay connected to my PGo+ device UNTIL I DISCONNECT IT! I spent $35 to play a “free to play” game and I deserve to have these issues addressed.   I’m really enjoying the new weather features!  Niantic, quality of life updates will go along way. 
I get that the point was to get people out and moving, but for some of us that just isn’t possible due to disability. In the beginning you could drive around and it would work fine but then they made it where you could no longer do this. There’s an entire population left out of being able to play a potentially fun game. I’d love to be able to participate, but the blatant ableism is just too much here.
It use to be good, but now it’s a focus on IAPs and pushing out more Pokémon. Currently there are several bugs in the app that haven’t been fixed, including error code 29 that lives to pop up in the middle of a Kyogre raid, freezing whenever you interact with a gym, and gps issues. 
I just wanted to give you some ideas for new updates.  1. Release avatar items of Ash and his friends. Like Misty, Brock, Kasey, Iris, Cilan, Max, May and Dawn. Pick as many as you want.   2. Release special Pokecoins that you earn from winning raid battles, and each one is worth 5 regular Pokecoins.   3. Try making it so that you can trade your own Pokémon to your friends that play, like a gift. When you hit the transfer button it will ask you if you want to transfer it to the professor, or if you want to trade it to another friend. All you have to do is type in their username, and it will transfer your Pokémon.   4. Make it so that you can create your own Pokestops and Pokémon gyms, so you can pick whatever place you want. Because some areas don’t have any Pokestops or Pokémon Gyms at all, and it makes the game not fun for them.  Thank you!  (You don’t have to do all of these. Just pick one or two.)  🦄😄 
I love Pokémon but I HATE always having to worry about poke balls I live in a area that doesn’t have any pokestops I want unlimited poke balls I had a frikin Blastoise st my house and I ran out of pokeballs
I really, really, really like playing pogo and I play it pretty much as often as I can. Recently, however, I’ve noticed connection difficulties during login and while actively playing a game. Nothing on my end has changed, and it doesn’t seem to matter whether I’m connected via wifi or mobile data, or if I’m away from home it doesn’t seem to matter where I’m at.
Why in god’s name are pokemon as low as 96 CP escaping pokeballs and fleeing? What happened to the programming where low CPs are now harder to catch?
They are not special if every year they have the same hat. For example the santa hat pikachu! Limited edition my ***!
I lose berries, pokeballs and good Pokémon if I’m at anything below LTE. The app will shut itself down and lose me a Pokémon and take all of my items it took to even try to get it.
I tried using the same account that I had before the one i have now and it did not work can you try and look into that please
Every single day, multiple times a day, my game freezes completely and I don’t know how to make it function anymore. Not even worth it anymore.
Ok, love the game but I have an idea about the game, add a local chat feature. That would make it so much easier for casual players to meet up for raids. Instead of using another social thing to find a group and meet up, I’d make it so it isn’t a free chat but a set chat feature? So like prewritten stuff cause obviously kids play this game a lot so don’t let like weirdos on but this would make like doing raids a lot easier cause I used to use facebook to find groups but now that I moved I don’t really have anyone up here or know how to find anyone so like a simple chat feature would be cool to see what raids people are going to and so I could join in. I don’t know just a thought would make playing Pokémon go a lot easier for casual players. Plus at the moment it’s tough to find players in general.
got white screen when trying to fight
I can’t wait for fifth generation!!!
It's a great game, but the feature that me and all of my friends wanted is to have PvP and/or trading. That would make me give it 5 stars and publicly announce that I play Pokémon Go.
I love this game to death. However, since this last update the app is freezing so much during play. It froze to where I lost my chance catching certain Pokémon and have to start the whole thing over. Other than that I love it!!
Pokemon Go is good and all but it has lots of glitches and it’s almost impossible for me to play. I tried a raid battle but it said “GO” then it kept on kicking me out. Another time it glitched was when I was trying to capture a pokemon and suddenly the pokeballs phased into the ground and some were transparent. I hope you guys fix these glitches.
I went for a 4-mile run today with the app open the entire time. My “buddy” and hatching eggs accrued only .5 kilometers each. How is that?  This is a constant occurrence.
I love this game it’s really addictive the problem is I don’t live in a town or near one at all so I can’t play the game that much I wish Pokémon at least spawned near my house. And I wish their were pokestops in the middle of nowhere.
Okay. I do not own Pokémon GO on the device I an using to write this. I do play it, and it's amazing! But, alas, I am giving this three stars because I currently have an iPhone 4. I am not able to get this fantastic game on my phone because, "Oh, it requires an iPhone 5 or better AND IOS 8." Please SOMEHOW make this playable on iPhone 4! I will give this five stars when it happens, Niantic. I love this game, but I don't love how it requires IOS 8 and an iPhone 5 and up! Please make this happen! Thank you.
U should be able to breed Pokémon.It would be a good feature and more people would come on and play the game.
🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬WHY???? I WISH KHEW.... but I would give this 5 STARS But My Mom does not know that I can’t get on my table!!!😡
Awsome game guys, but scan it fix the bug where if your running you can’t get a poke stop? Thx!!!
Okay so I forgot my username before I could get in and it. So the problem with that is I don’t know my screen name or my player ID so I can’t get it. And it won’t let me use the email address I used even though I used and different username and password and all that. PLEASE HELP!!!😢
The events aren’t as good as they used to be and I really think 5km eggs are not that good. 10km egg Pokémon also have very low cp.
I SPENT HOURS GETTING DRAGONAIR AND THE NEXT MORNING IT DISAPPEARS THIS ISNT THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED. I WANT MY HOURS PLAYING THIS BACK.
Right when I finish everything right It disappears  🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬😡😡😡😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬🤬😡🤬😡😡🤬🤬😡🤬🤬😡🤬😡🤬🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡😡😡😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬🤬😡🤬😡 
App won’t start, it crashes on the niantic screen. My iPhone is not jailbroken. iPhone 8 on the latest OS
This app is really a wonder and an amazing addition to the franchise! I really enjoy playing it and can’t wait for future updates. Just a suggestion, maybe implement a trading mechanic or have your buddy visibly follow you.
I play when able.  I am already a walker. The game might alter my route. Gyms and centers were redone.  Each is more easily distinguishable now.  The game is free. I gave it 3 of 5 stars for reasons.  It might be mostly cloudy outside.  However, the game shows rain.  One day I battled.  Each of my Pokémon fainted.  I lost.  I had several hundred max potions.  I used less than 10.  I battled again and lost.  I revived each Pokémon.  I had no potions of any type to heal them.  I contacted Pokémon GO twice.  The first time I was told that any items I drop are gone. The second time was perhaps you lost track. For the most part, it is a good game. 
I put in my email and it didn’t say it was a real email then I checked my email and redid it and it still didn’t work
I had about 272 Pokémon and it restarted on me 😭
Very glitchy and you have to get rid of the app and reload it
This app is fun but I can only play it inside my house and I can’t catch a lot of Pokémon and poke stops because when I went outside to go to poke stops and Pokémon it always says not internet connection even though I have internet connection.
I want to hake
I like this game but I hate it when you can’t log back in to your account on a different device
I find it annoying that I keep running out of poke balls and I can’t go to poke stops because I’m a kid the only time I go near a poke stop is when I’m going some where and I have no money so my idea is give all players 10-50 poke balls a day hope I gave you a good idea
taking a break until a trading update comes out see you all again if that ever happens
I hate that I can’t just take off from my job to play a game I like and the fact that that’s why you expect is ridiculous. And you KNOW people have your ex raid system but refuse to change it. You don’t listen to your players and it is going to kill your game.
This game is pumping out updates way too fast, and the bugs that aren’t getting fixed come with it. The game takes forever to load, which is understandable given the scope, but when it does it still needs another couple minutes to get everything in place. Also, whenever I try to click into a gym, it takes forever to load. If I try to do raids or battles, it often freezes. Poke balls will freeze halfway through capture and I lose the ball but don’t get the species. Review will remain one star until these are fixed.
You should have the option to delete any of the the items you have not just some of them. For example you can’t delete raid passes to make room to collect more items.
When you really get down to it. Game is. It fair, level 35 and no shinys,other people have 15. also Pokémon go community day! What a joke, 3 hours long on a Saturday. Why not another 3 hours on Sunday.
Game is awesome, but I work nights sometimes & can’t get to all the available gym raids during the day because I’m tired. It would be great it they would have an adult only kinda thing at night for those who can’t get to the “legendary” Pokémon raids during the day. Keep up the good work
Today is February the 24th, i have been playing the game almost all day and i didn't see any Dratini in the game, they just sending fake news to make you be there and waste your time like i did today,   Im not giving 5 stars till they make the game better, I feel like i threw my money away 
Game is literal trash if you live anywhere other than a city or suburb, you have to buy everything because there are no pokestops and there are almost no Pokemon to be found unless you use incense, which big shocker, you have to buy. It could be an easy 4 star if they made it playable for non city dwellers
I deleted the app cause of all the glitches. Decided to redownload and give it another chance. Seems better. But I still can’t give a berry to my Pokemon in hopes of giving it motivation. I can’t stay by the gym. Not especially at night. So can’t defend. And I think once you reach seven days catching a Pokémon or spinning a poke stop that it should stay at 7 and get more rewards instead of starting over. If you miss a day then you start over but if you don’t it should increase a day.
The game is fun and everything but I’ve deleted it a couple times due to it freezing/glitching while trying to catch Pokémon.  I let my daughter play in the backseat to collect pokestops on the way to/from school. The pokestops don’t work when driving. It only says to try again because it takes so long for the pokestops to load. 
Make it not time when you’re in a raid battle please developers
It suks   P.s.i spelt it wrong on purpose it’s so bad I’m getting a d in Engliesh 
I could not find any Dratini during the community event on Feb 24 2018 and when I evolved my Dragonair into Dragonite during the timeframe, it did not learn Draco Meteor. Will this event setup ever be repeated?
What good are all these events when the game is nothing but a giant bundle of errors that can only be cleared by restarting your phone?  Do you really need 2Gigs of tracking data per week to still not be able to stop cheaters?  This has gotten to be a disgusting joke. 
This game is fun, but shiny Pokémon could be more available and less rare.
I love this game but the shiny Pokémon event was short and I didn’t even get a shiny !
So I loved Pokémon go but after like 2years of losing my account I decided to make a new one so I was putting in my email like 100 times it kept saying that my email was wrong or I already had a account so I try to login to my old account it didn’t work SO PLEASE fix it so I can use my email multiple times
I played this game ever since it came out and I never got a shiny Pokémon!!!
This game has always been sh*t and it still is.
I’ve been a player since the beginning, and despite all their attempts to add improvements/new Pokemon/etc. they undercut it with poor decisions, poor planning, and lack of thoughtfulness. I seriously doubt any of the developers, QA testers, or decision-makers actually play the game. For example:  random changes to how pokeballs, fruits, etc. behave or are tapped/used. Or awarding an “Ex Raid Pass” for a special event at a gym I happened to defeat once on vacation and don’t live anywhere near. Every time I open the game (which is getting less and less) it’s a roll of the dice with what’s going to disappoint me next. They need to get their act together before they drive the rest of us away.
This game has the potential to be great , but at the moment it’s trash.
PLEASE make another way to get coins! I don’t drive and can’t always go to a gym to get coins, I might have to delete the app if there isn’t a change soon.
The thing freezes all the time and I caint play in gym battles not very happy right now
I love this game! I helps me stay active and gives me some motivation to go for runs. It’s a fantastic game but the god has been acting up recently
Love the game.  Enjoy spending time with kids with this game.  Only issue I have is you can not place Legendary Pokémon in Gyms.  This needs to be be fixed.
Pokémon go makes me happy all the time either playing it with other people or just having something that you grew up with become virtual reality, Pokémon go is amazing.
Okay so Niantic listen up okay? In 2016 I was all like "oh boy, Pokemon go! This in gonna be fun!" Then after about 8 months, it got REALLY BORING. After a year of playing, the game became one of the most boring games on my phone. So, here's an idea, ok? Put strategy and actual real Pokemon concepts in here. Like literally all you do in Pokemon go is swipe your screen up and tap. And it is 0.00000001% strategy. You just power up something a lot and kill everyone. So, put actually good ideas into this game and NOT make it boring trash. Thank you and good night-morning -some-random-time. (Idk what 4:39AM is classified as)                  -SuperSonicFan427  Update: CUT DOWN ON THE DANG EVENTS NIANTIC!! it’s stupid that there’s an event almost everyday now, and my parents are always out so I’m never home and I can never play with my friends or do other actually fun stuff. Also you better cancel this “community day” thing. NOW. THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES.                      Sincerely,                  Your friend SuperSonicFan427 
I can't log in or my brother and my dad and my sis and my mom and me it's so so so so hard to log in I've tried like 50 times picking a username and guess what NEVER WORKED😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢
I can no longer play Pokémon go and idk why... if I have to update my phone screw niantic smfh
It says that if you have feebas as your buddy and you walk 20 kL it will evolve.When I got feebas as my buddy and walked 20 kL it did not evolve.
This game used to only send out hazardous weather warnings when there was a snow or rain storm, but now it does it every time I log in. Please fix! Otherwise the game has been good lately.
Can you add battles? Like when you Friend is bragging about his dang Quilfish and you want to show him who’s boss? And make it to where you can put more Pokémon in gyms. The End. Credits: Me Me Me Me Myself I 
I can’t log in because my parents have restrictions on so I think there should be another way to log in please I’m begging you I’ve always wanted to play please!😩😫
I was thinking earlier about why we still haven’t gotten battling friends breeding and trading yet and then realized that breeding would be way overpowered because pro Pokémon gamers that I watch YouTube vids of. Always talk about perfect IV Pokémon breeding and so if we were able to do that in Pokémon go ITS WOULD BE CHAOS cuz all the lower level people would never get in gyms if someone with a OVERPOWERED BLISSEY is destroying ur entire team just cuz it’s IVs are so good so niantic I suggest that u still go wit battleing wit friends and trading wit friends but no breeding because it would be an unfair advantage to people like me who r at a high level and have good Pokémon for breeding
I love playing with my family.
Planned all week to go out with friends together to play and on the evening of 2-23-18 the servers were so bad we could not play. Lockups and network errors were soo bad. My group & i have played since beginning and 2 of us are level 40. We know how the game should play. It was as if the servers were in pieces in the floor!  We tried for 4.5 hours in a few different areas and had to just quit and go home. At least our dinner out was nice. 😢😤😢. Very frustrating.
Numerous network (2) errors, game freezes and just general slowness have resulted in me wanting to take a break from this. This is a shame as I really like playing and getting outside to walk. Niantic please fix this.
I’m a long-time fan of the pokemon games. I was so excited for this game’s release. I was a little let down however. It’s not similar to the original pokemon games. I wish that it was more similar. I wish you could trade/battle with other players...that there were places designated as health centers and pokemarts to buy things. For example, you could buy TMs or other cool “moves” to teach your pokemon. I wish that to level up your pokemon it was based on xp earned from battles.   But on another note, the game also has a lot of bugs. There are constant “Network Errors” that can mess you up if your in the middle of a battle. They are annoying and frequent. 
Hi, I gave this game a three star because it’s needs a few things to be fix. The server is bad it always crashes, the map sometimes doesn’t show up and I live in Phoenix Az and I’ve been playing for 6 months it’s not bad it’s fun but it’s needs more pokestop where I Live please just putting out more pokestop would help me catch some more Pokémon. Thanks and keep up your company.
Love Pokémon Go... but lately our games freeze so much.  We can’t use eggs, or any type item as such cause it keeps freezing. Also I can’t feed my Pokémon at the gyms cause it freezes. Please!!! Help!!  Thank you! Other then that we are avid players and LoVe the game!!!
I grew up in japan and have loved Pokémon practically my entire life. That being said, This use to be a fun game. I’ve played it since the day it came out. But unfortunately hackers and cheaters have made it virtually impossible to do anything with the gyms in my local area. They hack so much that the gyms glitch CONSTANTLY now and it’s only getting worse by the day. It was fun but every penny I’ve spent was wasted. I understand it’s America and everyone wants to be fat and lazy, but find a different game to play then. Thank you so much for holding to your promises of fixing this, Aswell as other updates yet to be seen.   Sincerely, Your next cheater 🖕 
I love this game so much. It’s just toooo addicting. I love the new gen pokemon. One thing I want too is if you can add new balls. I would love that update and this is a great game! Keep up the good work. ;)
This app keeps saying Network Error when I go to gyms to battle, leave a Pokemon, and try to feed Pokemon; this has been going on since yesterday. Today the message started to appear when catching Pokémon and going to poke stops. I don’t know what’s going on. Hopefully the app is getting a new update.
Game still freezes and crashes all the time, especially when interacting with gyms. Still waiting on a fix
This game is soo janky im surprised they still have so many players it feels like the updates just make it more glitchy its very frustrating trying to play when it freezes and kicks you in and out of a gym. Fix your game! And also be considerate with the gym coin allotment! How is it that a persons pokemon can be in a gym for 3 days plus but they will only get 50 coins thats crappy!
This game is awesome but sometimes it keeps saying network error and it bugs or lags I think you guys should fix the problem oh and add new legendarys like regirock,regice,registeel and regigigas.
Problems loading the app, freezes frequently and must be restarted numerous times. When the application finally does load, it lags terribly. Reports Network Error quite often.
The only reason why i’m playing this is because my family forces me to and they’re not hard core Pokémon fans like me. This game has been out for a year and a half and even though it’s on Generation Three there is a lot of problems with it. The fact that every time there is an update i can’t play for some reason. I can’t enter gyms or spin pokéstops, when the game does finally start after a long loading screen all i see is a black screen, and the worst part is i have been robbed of gym raid passes more than i fight raid bosses and get them. This game also makes no sense. Why should the pokémon trainer level up when we don’t do anything. It’s the pokémon that do all the hard work. The whole point of pokémon leveling up after battles was to make it fun, exciting, and worth playing. You could play against your friends with really high powerful pokémon and see who had was lucky enough to come out on top. Another thing is why is it that pokémon need candy and stardust to level up. This part makes no sense. Candy exist in the pokémon universe but for different reasons. Why can’t pokémon go be an extension of the pokémon franchise instead of its own thing. Seriously this game is worse than Star Wars Seven. At least in Star Wars the god awful evil characters stayed dead, but in this game they keep coming back like a disease i don’t have the right medication for.
Best game in the App Store to entertain people who hate walking while walking/jogging to get in shape. This app has made chubby nerds everywhere get active... or make them spend money on gas & drive around at 15mph at least. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Plz make a daily reward plz but only poke balls
Ive beaten rayquaza 9 times and groudon 1 and have never caught them. To this day i havent even missed a throw with a ball when i try. Its so disheartening to see the pokemon i loved as a kid and know they are only out for a certain amount of time be teased to me only to fail time and time again to catch them. Honestly if i caught just one id be more inclined to spend a dollar on the game here or there but as of right now im more likely to delete it. So disappointing
Pokémon is one of my favorite games and I play everyday with my dad. One thing that I think needs improvement is the ability to beat raid bosses because many people can’t get huge groups together and they miss out on an amazing aspect of the game.
BEST GAME EVER even my mom plays it but trading and XP evolve better then best game ever XP evolve comes from other Pokémon games and trading is awsome and add more legendarys
I’m trying to sign into an account, but every time I try to make one it tells me to check your parents email it tells me to make an account and when I tried to do that it just did the same thing like last time
I was playing the game at a local park when the location services weren’t working I restarted the game check my location services in the settings app and found that the location services were always on for Pokémon GO but for some reason it will not work at the specific local park but it will work anywhere else do not spend your money or your time on this app
We should be able to see other players walking around town! It would be pretty fun. Maybe tap them for their profile and a friend list?
For some reason, my avatar ends up in places that I’m not at. It’s like a couple of feet off. But still, I love this game. Please fix this.
Just release all the old school Pokémon games on the App Store. Like red, blue , yellow. People still wanna play those game and are just being purchased through 3rd parties. Re release them on mobile make some money and hook the players up.
I love Pokémon go, my only beef is that the game constantly crashes. I would think after being out for over a year now they would’ve fixed it, but it just gets old having to close the game every time I reopen it from another app. It’s really fun, just still has some bugs that need to be fixed.
It was terrible I couldn’t even get passed the sigh up page total the  thumbs down👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
I love walking around capturing these tiny little creatures, but I have a major complaint about gyms. Why do I sometimes have a Pokémon return to me without earning any coins? I once had a Pokémon guarding a gym for over a week, and when it returned, I received nothing. We should get coins for every Pokémon, whether it returns to us due to lack of motivation or defeat by another player. I’ve probably missed out on hundreds of coins due to this. Thank you very much.
Now they screwed with the coin system too.  To get coins (besides from buying them) you must put a pokemon in a gym. The pokemon we’ll gain 1 coin every 10 minutes, until it reaches the limit of 50 coins after 8 hours and 20 minutes. After this point, YOU CANNOT GET ANYMORE COINS NO MATTER HOW LONG THE POKEMON STAYS IN THE GYM. One would think that to get around this, you could just placed another pokemon in a different gym, BUT NOPE. You are limited to 50 coins per day, so if you have had two pokemon in gyms for let’s say 3 weeks, and they both come out on the same day, YOU WILL ONLY GET 50 STUPID COINS. So basically the only way to get coins now is to buy them.
When pokemon go will come at TÜRKİYE Apple store.
Games fun
Love the game. But all of the sudden I am not able to open the application. Check to see if there was an update, but there was none. Even restarted the phone. No access to the application.
So stupid are you do is walk around and just catch Pokémon with your stupid phones
This game can be fun to play, but not when it freezes constantly for no reason!
Please, make a way to grind Pokémon in rural areas. If I walk a mile around my area, there are 2 spawns. I understand that gyms, and stops are at popular places, but why can’t I walk at home? Just make it so that every 0.1k you walk, a Pokémon appears. Rural players need something.
Love to play Pokémon go but it’s BS when you put your Pokémon down at a gym ad they’re there for a day and you get 0 coins you guys really need to fix that you should be getting your coins or there no point of putting Pokémon at gyms and a second thing when doing raids there been times when i hit a Pokémon with ever ball i was given but not one could capture the Pokémon I’ve missed out on legendary Pokémon
Major issue that needs to be fixed: Is the feeding system should be available only AFTER a battle of all the Pokémon in the gym AND/OR when nobody is battling down the gym. I have encountered along with few others that we are in a battle to faint a 800CP Blissey (for example) out and as soon as we believe that we knocked that Blissey out it got fed a golden berry just before it got knocked out to go back to 2997. It would be great to disable treat feeding during battles. Yes I know that you might get a few coins less but it would level the playing ground in general.   The weather feature is great but needs a more realistic feeling. Like where I live sometimes it can be cloudy/partly cloudy on one side of town and sunny on the other side of the town or foggy on one side and either cloudy or sunny on the side or light rain around town with cloudy weather on other parts. The feature that needed is weather changes depends where you are at the moment. Don’t know if it’s possible or not.   What’s frustrating lately is when you battle a gym down and the same exact team takes it over before you can put a Pokémon into the gym. Example Instinct gets knocked out of the gym and within 3 seconds Instinct is taking over that gym again. How is that even possible? I thought whoever defeated the gym first was prioritized. Niantic- Do something to fix this issue. Also I ran across a bug/glitch that error myself along with a few people I’m with out of battling after damaging a few Pokémon in a nearby gym and someone was able to put a Pokémon in that gym while battling it down (you guys need to crack down on those cheaters).   Edit: With the EX Raid passes, the passes should go to active raiders in the community and NOT some level 20 guy who has done a few raids recently (3 in one week and 7 all together). Also spread the passes along the active raiders so everyone has a fair chance. And if a group of people get an EX-Raid pass for the same gym there should be talks between the group to see what day and time would work instead of a set day and time and is a inconvenience for some of the group.   What’s needed soon is a trading for Pokémon and trading/selling for stuff in the inventory. The reason for trading Pokémon needs to come out because someone people came around just after the Legendary Birds disappeared or may not have Tauros (my region Pokémon) and are extremely low on funds or don’t have time to travel). Selling/trading items in the inventory is needed because some people don’t have enough of one or two items or people don’t want to give up tons of items in the inventory for nothing (maybe bulk selling is worth 5-10 coins for potions and 2-5 coins for balls) and bulk selling can happen every 3-4 days.   What’s needed is daily objectives. Need to complete 2 or 3 goals. And the rewards are 5 Pokeballs, 15 or 20 coins, and 100xp for daily rewards and 10 Pokeballs, 50 coins, and 400xp for the weekly reward and 30 Pokeballs, 200 coins, and 2,000xp for the monthly reward.   Also what's needed is raid punishment for people who leave during battle. It gets frustrating when you almost done with the raid and most people leave because their Pokémon die and don't feel like selecting new ones or a raid just starts with 12 people (example) and most of them leave except myself and 1-2 other people. But if you do leave for whatever reason it should go 1) warning 2) 4 day raid suspension 3) 1 1/2 weeks raid and gym suspension 4) 4 weeks raid and gym suspension. And game suspension after 3rd suspension (starts at 2 weeks then when you come back you start the gym/raid suspension). If you lag out or lose connection or "error" then you won't be punished.   Also if you join a Raid but have to get going (work, weather, emergency in the area, late somewhere) just as it starts or shortly after it starts they should give the player a .25 to .5 of a mile to battle in the raid before it kicks them out.   With raids, they should pop up even at night and early morning hours from 8pm to 5am. The only catch is that the raids are 1 and 2 stars in parks and non-residential areas so it won’t disturb people.   With earning coins at gyms, it frustrating when you in a gym for 2+ days and only get A 1 day bonus of 50 coins. I've been in multiple gyms that I've defended for 3-4 days and only got 50 coins. So it would be nice to get the coins for the rest of days you are in the gym and get extra coins for extended stays in the gyms (so if you stay in for 4 days it would be 200 and extended stay would be 250 altogether). And if there are 2+ Pokémon in different gyms you should be able to get the same coins amount. Also if you are in a gym for a short period of time (like 5 minutes give or take) at least reward us with a couple of coins at least.  Edit: There should be a friend request/list for this game along with with chat. So if you run across a helpful person/group you have the option to send them a friend request. Or can add people in different states and countries. It might be good so you can invite friends to raids or trading (if it comes out).   Edit: Also maybe once a month for 1 day is open the requests for gyms and Pokéstops. It will be great for for people in rural areas (not myself though) and places that don’t have that many (which I seen). And maybe remove/organize couple of pointless Pokéstops (there’s one Pokéstop that’s a painting that isn’t there anymore and with a gym draped over the Pokéstop is a Starbucks so maybe have the Starbucks as the gym badge or whatever it’s called). 
I love this game. It helps me get out and walk and stay active. The only thing I don’t like is that certain Pokémon are only on certain continents or areas. Some of us don’t have the money or time to travel to other places to catch these Pokémon. I know they do events where we can catch some Pokémon not in our area but not all of us can get out and do those events. It would be nice if the Pokémon could rotate around for the people who can’t get out and catch those Pokémon. Also if players could battle each other that would be awesome and for us able to trade Pokémon with each other.
I was playing fine without any major issues until about a week ago and now it constantly freezes and locks up. I just tried to feed my Vaporeon berries remotely and it froze every time I gave her a berry, so I have up. PLEASE FIX SOON!!
I personally love this game. It has it's problems like the speed cap, but I understand why it is there even though it is unfair. What is also unfair is that there is a coin cap of 50 when your Pokémon returned from a gym. I have a Rhydon that stayed at a gym for 4 days and only returned with 50 coins. It is unfair if the coin cap is 50 no master how many days they stayed. I think if you do a coin cap of 50 per day would be good. For example, if a Pokémon stays at a gym for 4 days, they will get 200 coins instead of 50. People will agree this is more fair for people to get more if they stay for multiple days instead of getting the same amount as someone who's Pokémon stayed for 10 hours. Also can you make the evolutions items but able because not everyone has a route that involves running into a pokestop, much less interact with it due to the speed lock. Also bring back getting a Magikarp in an egg, as I read online that it was removed along with other Pokémon. But unlike those Pokémon who where removed or replaced by the baby Pokémon(it's a Pokémon term) Magikarp need so much candy to evolve and power up to Gyarados, but at least the buddy system makes evolving it bearable. NOW THAT YOU ADDED MORE POKÉMON, THE CATCHING RATE IS BROKEN. I CAN'T CATCH A REASONABLE POKÉMON WITHOUT IT BEING RELEASED. THE CAPTURE INCREASE IS A GOOD IDEA, BUT THIS NEEDS AN UPGRADE TO HELP CATCH POKÉMON. LIKE IF YOU CATCH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF POKÉMON OF THE SAME TYPE, LIKE 400, 500, 750, AND/OR 1000 IT INCREASE THE CHANCE TO CATCH THE POKÉMON. Also let us buy the great and ultra balls to help us catch more Pokémon and buy evolution items. Otherwise, it is a good game. Also I would like to report an bug that crashed my phone. It disabled my phone for a bit. I don't know if it is a bug on the app or the phone( Most likely app because there was nothing wrong with my phone prior) but please fix it so it wouldn't happen again.
On the game it said that there are pokemon in the in one of the state parks where i live but the is no service or wifi down there so we cant get then.
My app locks up constantly since the update a week ago. Also my player is stuck in the same place and won’t move.The dragonite event is coming up- it would be nice  if this was fixed before then.
My account got deleted randomly as I was logging in and tried to relog in but it made me restart. Super upset I was at level 23 and now I have to start all over
There really isnt much do in this game but walk around and catch pokemon. You cant battle any friends or trade at all. Something needs to be done or else less and less people will play this. I play the pokemon video games and its way more fun than this crap since you can train and battle and get all the pokeballs you want for free.
I love this game it is my most used app but 25% of the time when I open it the gps doesn’t work I don’t know if it’s my phone or the game but if it is the game I would really love to see it fixed five stars definitely just hope that is fixed⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Whenever I try catching a Pokémon the game freezes on the Pokémon forcing my to restart the game. Other than that it is okay.
I love the game, It’s fun, interesting and addictive. I hope they add in trade and trainer battles with friends in the future.
There is 3 fun aspects to this game and for some people they can’t do any of it. Catching, fighting in gyms, raids... not much else. No real goal unless you want a strong team or catch them all.
Iiiiiiii lllloooovvvveeeee iiiiiiiiiitttttt
I can never feed pokemon at gyms it freezes every time it gets irritating. Thats the only thing wrong with the game please fix if possible.
Awesome! All I can say! Yet the raids need fixed, and we need more wardrobe items! Especially some winter gear, gloves, belts, etc. Other than that, Awesome!
The berry feeding and gym interaction crashes have gotten so bad the game is broken in terms of gym interactions. I have to switch my phone in and out of airplane mode even to reload PoGo after it crashes.
There isn’t enough Pokémon that spawn in the neighborhoods!!!!!
Game keeps freezing randomly. please fix. also it's be nice if you set a limit to how many golden berries people can give to their pokémon. very annoying when you're about to take out a gym and then suddenly all pokémon have full health 😒
Turtles r awesome also I like the game
Hate this game but exciting and fun
I make a full account and it keeps making me do all my password again this is the 50th time I tried to make an account and it keeps saying that I forgot something and i put in everything it asked and it wants me to do it over and over and over don’t download this it’s a waste of space
It’s a great game but there needs to be more poke stops in rural areas
I would like to know why it says excellent when you get a pokemon and The Pokémon breaks free. This has happened to me quite a few times so is there a point to it. They NEED to fix the catch rate. They also NEED to fix pokemon disappearing and the poke stop from say “try again later”.
I am a huge Pokémon fan, have been since I was a kid and when this game came out I was extremely excited to get my very own Charmander! However this game has not lived up to my high expectations, it is a complete failure. Every update just makes the game crash worse than before like are you people kidding me?! I’m out here trying to be a trainer, trying to battle at gyms that either don’t let me or kick me out in the middle of a battle. Not to mention nearly 90% of the time I am trying to play the GPS of the game doesn’t work! You’re supposed to be Pokémon Go not Pokémon only when convenient. If the app ever gets better I will change my review, until then I urge you to not waste your time downloading this game.
Upgraded from iPhone 8 to iPhone X and I noticed everything in the app is closer. When opening the app some Pokémon that originally showed up don’t anymore, Larvitar for example.   In addition the catching is all wrong, up close Pokémon you over throw and far away Pokémon you can’t even reach. I’ve missed out on so many Rayquazas because of this.   I’ve tried using the app on Samsung 8 and it has the same issue. Please address, I’ve wasted premium raid passes. 
This is a fun app, when it works. The problem is it crashes and freezes all the time, and it’s very frustrating! Maybe instead of adding all the new functionality, it might be a good idea to get what you have working?
Pokémon Go gets me up and out of my house and I really enjoy playing it!!!
But it seems to be buggy and sometime won’t log me in or won’t show any stops or anything. Hopefully an update can fix this! Other than that, I really love playing!!
There should be a game adjustment where we can battle the Pokémon in the wild that would be fun and creative
I hope soon they will update so you can battle other players pokemon in person or near u so that your pokemon can get stronger
Rayquaza is uncatchable on the iPhone X. AR+ mode is also unusable. They need to remove the completely false claim that this game works with iPhone X because it doesn't.
Sometimes it says unable to authenticate and it makes me so mad my friend won a rayquaza raid without me
NEEDS ASPECT RATIO FIXED FOR THE IPHONE X  YOU CAN EVEN THROW A BALL AT LEGENDARY  RAYQUAZA PLEASE FIX THIS!   AS FOR RAID PASSES  I WOULD RECOMMEND IF WE USE ONE AND NO ONE SHOWS UP AND YOUR WAITING FOR OTHERS AND THE TIMER RUNS OUT  WE SHOULD GET OUR PASS BACK!!!   Also we need to have you guys increase the SPEED CAP for those who ride the bus,train or a passenger in a car! 
Idk what’s going on but since I updated the app yesterday, I leave my pokemons in gyms and they stay for hours but I’m not getting any coins idk why
So disappointing... haven’t been able to play since the last update.
I love Pokémon go but I believe there should always be new Pokémon popping up. I also believe that on our seventh day we should get incubators or even from the towers.
They should make it so that the poke ball can bounce and still catch the poke mon 😁
Please make the Pokémon more accessible in rural areas. I live on a farm and the only way I can get Pokémon is going into town which is 30 minutes away. I don’t think that makes much sense. I mean wouldn’t Pokémon, being that they’re wild, be more out In the country and in the wild??? 4 stars though, it’s fun and addicting for when I’m in town.
This a great game but my grandma got hit by a bus when she was playing fun game but watch we’re ur going!!
when i play my charter just radomle moves
Several in my area who are not real players really ruin this for me.  I am places at odd times when no one else is in range but these people are simultaneously in all area gyms with constantly full hearts.  Very disheartening and Niantic should shut these people down.
This is not good I just wanna play the game but I have to pay money like INSANE!!??? But I do not like this feature 😢😤
I would give this a five star rating, but it has gotten more crash prone and buggy in recent updates. It’s frustrating to be in the middle of game play and have the game freeze. Almost as frustrating are the network errors that prevent you from participating in raid battles or creature captures. Heavy battery drain is also an issue. Come on, Niantic. Fix the problems so this otherwise great game can thrive!
Great. But the weather feature is a little off. It's not accurately matching what my local area weather is.
Anyone else having an issue with the app locking up on the iPhone X?
I really love this game just wish you guys would get rid of the “training” badge. Only for those who don’t have it gold. Like myself. The option to see your Pokémon’s attacks before you’re gonna fight a gym/doing a raid, that would be awesome.
I like this game a lot the only problem is that I can never spin pokestops because it says try again later even though I’m going 20mp
Fix it
I can’t log in!!!!!!!!!!!!! And I’m crying right now
The pokestops don’t work seriously I have played this game in 2 years and you still haven’t fixed the pokestops glitch. I loved this game unless you fix the pokestops glitch then I’ll be dropping mad money for poke coins.
App keeps freezing when I try to give my Pokemon berries , going into gyms and right after the loading screen
I’m basically house bound due to health reason so the nearest Pokestop is one I can reach without needing to drive or take transportation. With the last update that stop was removed and the nearest one to me is now two miles away at a dangerous intersection. So with that I’ve removed the game since there’s no reason to play it since I can’t spin for poke balls or play in a gym.
Great game you should total get it and download the app it’s perfect for exercise
Missed six in a row since the last upgrade. Basically one out of ten balls can reach it. Please try it yourself. Very frustrated.
Since last game update in iPhoneX, my husband and I failed to catch a single Rayquaza in 6 gym battles. Whereas I caught 3 out of 5 before the update. I totally agree with a Raddit post that neither my curveballs nor my straight shots could reach it. I played this game since day one and I know how to through. The balls I was throwing felt depth-less, like I was throwing the balls into thin air. I switched to AR+ but failed to caught it too. Please fix the bug! So frustrating to see a 2077 Rayquaza fled.
I give this game a 5 star rating because of the amount of time I'm out and about, and how fun it is. If you are looking for a excuse to get this game, let this be it. Anywhere you have Internet, you can travel around, finding Pokémon almost anywhere you go. If your in town, there will be Pokémon on almost every corner! Let yourself become the Best Pokémon Trainer, just by walking around and having fun! The app also makes sure of your safety. It reminds you that you should be aware of what's around you, and don't drive while playing. It can tell how fast you are going, so f your driving, the app will remind you to not be on your phone. Good Luck Future Pokémon Trainers!!!! ;)
I just looked at my Pokédex, and Bellossom was not registered. I remember evolving one a long time ago, but now it’s out of my Dex for some weird reason and is showing only as “seen”
This new version freezes constantly. Sometimes I have to restart because I can’t click on wild Pokémon. Yesterday it froze four times in a row on me.
It freezes on iPhone X when I try to feed my pets or other pets I gyms.
The original Pokemon series set the pave way for games to come, but this game does not deserve to be acknowledged by game freak nor Nintendo, due to it ditching all of the ideas that were in the other games in this franchise. If there was trading, and battling wild Pokémon, then I would’ve rated this higher but since they don’t have them, I’ll have to give this the grade it gets. 
Every time I throw a pokey ball it says error 26 I cant even enjoy the game and it says error 26 that’s why I’m mad.
I love this game and enjoy playing very much. But ever since the most recent update, I am constantly getting GPS signal errors and it’s making Pokémon disappear so they can’t be caught and when it reboots, they’re gone. Every time I pull down my notification bar, I have this issue. It will also happen randomly when I have the app open and running while my phone sits on my desk. It’s very aggravating and makes it difficult to collect them all. Hopefully this is fixed quickly or I will delete this app and quit playing.
Crashing in gyms. Please fix again.
I love this but for some reason when i walk the person on the screen won’t move it’s just stays in one place :/ Honestly i want to play but it just won’t work
I wasted a lot on 126 CP charmander
Used to be a really fun game, but niantic is too greedy and only looking to make money so they made the game a lot less competitive and introduced pointless money grabbing things such as raiding. Exclusive raids are set up for those who are willing to drive out only for sponsored gyms but it’s not based on how often one plays and the gym badge one holds. It also removed the competitive gym system which was the best part of the game. Radar system is awful too so serious players use 3rd party maps to track down rare mons which makes the game unbalanced. Do yourself a favor and go play something more fun.
It is a great game if you have WiFi. The only downside is that you can’t play much in Vermont.
I particularly love how the whole game freezes when trying to feed berries at gyms and has to be restarted only to freeze again if you again attempt to feed Pokémon.
I can’t get the poke balls to go far enough to hit rayquaza. It hits mid way and falls. Plz fix this.
Can you please just make an update so all we have to do to sign up is put our email and password
Freezes when I give berries at a gym. Kind of annoying because I have to give berries in order to get a badge but I can't because it freezes...
Pokémon go does not fit on iPad screen. I’ve been to apple. It’s not Amy setting on the pad. They said it is the app itself. Not everyone is playing on a phone. Come on niantic.
I love Pokémon go but all I want is every generation of Pokémon! Mainly because my favorite Pokémon, Marshadow, is In the alola region! And I’m soooooo annoyed. But otherwise great game! (If I’m wrong I’m sorry)
The app is amazing but the thing is I just want something like normal candy and grass candy not eve candy or parasect candy . If this can be patched in I will rate 5 stars and be so happy thank you for your time
My game does not register any of my walking. Apparently I haven’t walked AT all since last sept. I have tried logging out logging in - but no change in the status of trying to hatch any of these eggs. No way to contact anyone in tech support to help me out. Very frustrating.
Great app to play while traveling the world. The Pokémon GO plus bluetooth device is helpful.
So I love the game and all but one thing that is happening is I had pokemon in gyms for 1 day and they being beat out and I’m not earning coins which I should do please try to fix that niantic
Really good game but takes forever to download.
Overall Pokémon Go is a great game but with the new weather update it doesn’t quite cover every weather like snow and the walking with Pokémon to find Pokémon candies but when your walking why can’t they show up walking with you? It doesn’t really make sense... You can’t forget the rest of the Eevee evaluations! Like leafeon sliveon ect. Other than that its bound to be 5 stars!
Why the hell does this game need my billing information? I’m not paying money for s**t i get for free at the poke stops...
This is a review of a problem of the latest version bit the game in general which I rate 5 Stars. The latest version of Pokémon Go (1.61.2), locks up on my iPhone X while my wife’s iPhone 7 Plus works without any problems. Niantic please fix this issue of your version 1.61.2 Pokémon Go on iPhone X. 
I have been trying to get in for about a year but it will not work and I really wanna put it on my YouTube channel because I really love Pokémon. Ever since I heard of this game I was desperate to play, even some people at my school can get in but that is not the case for me. I have an iPad, does that have something to do with it? I can get into the app but i can’t get into the whole thing. I have tried all usernames and passwords recorded in my memory but nothing let me in. This has been going on for about 1 year. I am always watching Pokémon and one of my favorites is Zorua and of course fox types because of my love for foxes and Pokémon I have always wished of having a pet fox but that will probably never happened so if I could get in for one day and get a fox type Pokémon, that would be the best day in my life.
All around a good game just why update the app when Niantic is having issues now I can’t login with google get it together Niantic make sure the entire update is in working order or get some extra help with testing the updates in all honesty every other update I have issues with this game let’s get it together Niantic
can’t paste in a complex password which makes logging in painful when necessary.
I love this game it got my family motivated to get out there and get fit. My kids have acquired a healthy love for walking. Reading all these reviews I think there needs to be a platform where users can make suggestions. Obviously niantic can ignore the suggestions but they might get some really good ideas from it. I think they should also have a platform for support when the troubleshooting doesn’t solve the problem. For instance the app says it has a capability for family sharing... How do we do that??? My kids play with us but they don’t have their own devices I’d love to figure out how to use that! Also I think t would be a great added bonus to getting in a gym if you could collect items from the gym regardless of where you are (similar to the option where you can feed your Pokémon from far away)and it would give ppl who are far away from any gyms or stops a chance to collect items at a rate those of us who are near them can collect them. It would also motivate ppl more to get in those gyms or get in more gyms. Additionally in the areas where there are less stops you could make more of them gyms to provide more access to players in that area. Of course you could always limit the benefit when collecting from afar like you do with feeding Pokémon maybe make it collectible only every ten minutes or something... Anyways love the game not complaining just making suggestions ;)
It’s a ball waster. Go Plus will blink green. You push the bottom and it auto turns red and wastes your poke balls. Returning it for a full refund and I’m going to annoy niantic until you refund me all the poke balls I lost. Douches.
This is the best game. My life is dedicated to it. Got wild Dragonite. Got Wild Feraligatr Niantic treats me well. Although I want Go fest 2018 to be in Charlotte. 
I have always LOVED this app. But for some reason when I tried to get on it, it wouldn’t work. I realized that it happened AFTER the update. So I wish that y'all could fix that soon.
Your community “days” are only 3hrs per region. You should call it community 1/8 day.
This game is horrible. It doesn't sign in. It’s so stupid. This game is a giant piece of bear sh*t!!!
Pokemon games, even the spin-offs, have this special aura that no other game can capture. This game doesn't have that. Even if you like the gameplay, glitches all over. And if you are far from cities, good luck finding any stops or 'mons.
Pokemon go is wonderful and all, but there is one thing that is missing. TRADING!!! I think that we need it because people will like to play more after they get the Pokémon that they like. For example, my mom and I used to play together, so, hence, when I got my phone (it was already my other parents phone) it had an account already. I know my mom and I could share an account on 2 phones but what about the people that are friends, but not close enough to share an account? They would want to trade. You might think “ but what about the people that will only trade for bad Pokémon for better ones” yeah and what about the people that hack and don’t get banned? I don’t know, they live a normal life, who knows(they do). So their are ups and downs to this but if you think positively it will sound better.
New patch causes game to freeze all the time on iPhone 6. Not a stable release. Developers need to go back to the drawing board and fix the patch!
I’ve been playing this game for 3 months the only thing I want in the game is trading
Account sharing and multiboxing seems to be the norm in the gym battling scene. It’s bad enough instinct players make up less than a quarter of the active player base but the fact that pretty much every single mystic and valor player uses multiple accounts to knock their own accounts out of gyms for coins and bring more people to raids, basically invalidates anything you can do as a solo instinct player abiding by the terms of service. Niantic doesn’t care about you. They don’t even care if you don’t follow the terms of service. It’s a waste of thousands of hours. Don’t bother installing this game because it’s not family or kid friendly - it’s dominated by adult cheaters and you should not put your children around these people.
Swablu evolves with 400 candies. That makes sense.
Nothing more frustrating than not being able to have your game running for five min and then it freezes. Keep closing the app out and still only lasts five min. And this is after the new update!!! What the heck???
Glitchy as trash right now.  Constantly restarting game.
Since that last update there is no god signal to my the game. I have reinstalled twice to no avail. Please fix it!!!
Can we please have a shorter evolve process? We don't need to watch it go up in the air- it can just "poof" and be evolved.  Can we also please have, maybe, 5 prizes per pokéstop? Getting 2 or 3 per stop is quite frustrating. There’s so much to offer between fruits and pokéballs that could make the effort to hit a pokéstop much more enticing.  Oh and WE NEED TO BRING BACK TRAINING! I can’t power up my Pokémon any further because my “Trainer level is too low.”; very disheartening to an avid player.  Thanks! -A Loyal Fan 
I like how the gym battles added more interaction but we really need trading. Trading allows people to work as teams. Our neighborhood has a huge group to raid. Some of our group travels for work, but for others travel is not possible. Trading would help more bonding.
It’s a fun ish game
I love this game!! It would be super cool if you could battle one on one with any players nearby. Not necessarily at the gyms just out.
So many updates it is difficult to keep up with
Ok so I had my google account linked to Pokémon go a while back and I just re-downloaded it and I asked me to log in and I did but there where no pokeballs in the account and I could get anymore unless I bought them and I wasn’t gonna spend money so I trues to restart from the beginning , couldn’t figure it out and so I logged out and tried to make a account with Pokémon and every password I put was rejected or told me there was an error connecting to some sever I guess there where a lot of letter but in my opinion it’s too difficult to play a stupid game so I deleted it just wanted to let y’all know for other users!! Very disappointed and dissatisfied.
It takes a lot of battery power and they need to add more gens
Today I got a umberon!!!
Remove speed caps a$$holes
This app on most days is more frustrating to deal with than fun. If you’re actually looking for a game to play try something else. This is a game of collecting pokémon. The gym system is sad compared to what it use to be. And the amount of times this app has froze up is probably a few thousand times. I’m only playing till i hit level 40 and i’m done with it. Time to find something better to do with my time.
No longer works with iOS. PTC logins have been buggy in the past on iOS, now not working. Only works for Google/Android players.
They’ve made decent improvements to their game. But it’s still a buggy mess. You cannot feed more than a few berries to your Pokémon defending gyms until the game freezes. And their EX raid system is terrible.
Still crashes at gyms and now I cannot log in!😡
No puedo capturar pokemones con el iphone X. Las pokebolas no le llegan al Pokémon.
Every time I go to feed berries to the Pokémon at a gym the screen freezes. It is so frustrating!! Please fix this!! Fast!
No coin rewards frequently after holding a gym.
This game was awesome until the same few players (with multiple accounts) somehow got 15+ Blissey and Chanseys, stack them both in all the gyms, and feed them an endless supply of Golden Razz Berries as you try to battle them and throughout the day. Definitely sucked the fun right out of this game ☹️😡
Ok, let me be honest, I love this game, heck I would run  miles to catch a Pokémon, it made a healthy change to my life. BUT, we have a problem. I’m 13: • I can’t go far from home bc my parents get worried and call like crazy. • I can’t drive to different locations.  •And I most certainly can’t spend money on games!   Ok, I love traveling to places! It’s fun to go to different countries and see what Pokémon they have but... there’s a problem.  Every raid battle or gym battle, I fight with all I got and it’s fun, until all my Pokémon go down! No matter where I go to I can almost never find revives or potions! Heck, all my 3100-2700 and under Pokémon are fainted!!! I can’t find revives, I mean I know you guys want to profit out of this game but if you don’t put more revives and potions to be more common then more people will leave the game!   Please fix my concern and I won’t be forced to quit.😡 
Super game, one of the best games on the phone
Human sacrifice feature won’t work?
I've always loved Pokémon ever since I was little. This game is more fun than I could have imagined and one of my favorite games now. Looking for a good Pokémon game that keeps you active and entertained while you’re out? This app is perfect for you! Only complaints are the app has quite a bit of server problems since launch but understandable. Also it makes you sign in again to your account very often which can be annoying. Other than that, it’s an amazing creative game that everyone should play!  Edit: The game is MUCH better now, this review was a year ago. It’s come such a long way since! :) A lot less glitchy. 
The game works great on my phone and the game itself is wonderful but the only pokestop near me is two miles away, as a child with a disabled mother and a working father I don’t have many opportunities to go there and even when I do it mostly consists of me loitering around a church, trying to collect as much as I can before they tell me to go away(which has happened more times than I can count). The only other pokestop nearby me is literally on the highway and it’s a watertower in a restricted area. If you want anyone in Xenia to consider playing this game I insist that you add more pokestop, why not the Board of Education? Or maybe the Speedzone nearby there, at least they wouldn’t tell me to get lost. Please consider what I have brought up and search the area around Xenia for more spots.
I play Pokémon to everyday I play Pokémon go when I wake up I'm grabbing my phone, I wanna catch em all I wanna play pokemo-on all day long all day long
Please allow us to transfer accounts to another email address
Every. Single. Poke. Stop. Try again later!!! This is ridiculous! Please fix this! This is why I stopped playing the first time! Just redownloaded and still same problem!?
Pokestops are not working for me
Every time i seem to interact with a gym lately the game freezes for me. This is ridiculous now and I’m ready to stop playing again. Fix your servers!
You guys screwed me over on a rayquaza raid and took my raid pass so I can’t even do it! So please fix it cause I’m a active player and I want to keep playing but you have to fix all the glitches and errors!!!
You have to make an Account to play That what that’s it besides that it is great!       What’s good 
Seen 6 only caught 1 rayquaza after getting great throws with golden berries. And still no ex raid pass. You want mewtwo they only want your 💰   stop  stop spending 💰 in this awful buggy game. That'll make them listen to the players they have left
First of sorry for the bad framer in the title but anyhow I really like this game and it’s function can’t wait to catch  raquaza or get it from a raid battle but I think it would be really cool if you guys the developers realeased a game like ultra sun or ultra moon for IOS and Android would be really cool
Niantic is obviously making lots of money on raids, so that’s almost the entire focus of the game now. People drive around from place to place all day to get a chance to catch dozens of identical copies of legendary creatures that are supposed to be rare and unique. The gyms and tracking of wild Pokémon continue to receive no bug fixes or attention. I’m close to level 36 but I have no incentive to try to get there anymore.
But you didn’t address the bug that is locking up the iPhone 6 when you try to enter a gym. Might be just taller gyms. The display freezes but the game still functions behind the frozen screen.
Ooh ooh 🙋🏼‍♂️ you know what this game SHOULD have?? The ability for people to trade Pokémon. So the people who get screwed at Gym Raids can actually get the Pokémon they want from their friends who have it and are willing to trade. One of the biggest things that made Pokémon fun was the ability to trade...food for thought..
I love the game but hate, hate when it freezes.  Tired and frustrated of freeze even after the latest update.
Have Pokémon in gyms for days at a time only for them to be kicked out with no coins.  Will have one in for 1/2 a day and have it kicked out with a odd amount of coins(not complaining about that, but there’s something wrong if I there’s no coins back for days)
This game stinks because of one thing I don’t like putting all of the info that can lead to identity theft. if you could just let us play without any of the Pokémon trainer club or google it would get 5 stars but for now I give it a -5 star rating😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠 why color do this.
Today’s update is causing constant network errors! Kicking me out of gyms while raiding and me losing out on a bunch of Pokémon 🤦‍♀️
One of my favorite apps. Keep the events coming so we can go out and keep catching newer ones! So fun.
I love raid battles and gym conquering but something is wrong when I have to be hoping someone takes down my gym to claim the 50 gold coins and for every day that my pokemon remains superior... I’m basically getting penalized by losing the 50 coins I could have gotten that day. The coins should be claimed if the limit of 50 has been reached that day. That is the only big flaw I see so far.
APP CRASHES EVERY TIME I GIVE CANDY TO POKEMON THAT ARE DEFENDING A GYM. THIS IS ANNOYING, BECAUSE I CANT HEAL ANY OF MY POKEMON WHO ATE DEFENDING. PLEASE FIX 👍
You guys are seriously great at fixing any random bugs and in a timely manner too.  great app, the engineers should be proud. well done 
Thanks for making this game
I play air pets my Apple Watch as I can’t always have my phone out and about. I can sneak hatch Pokémon at work while I do my job. It makes me happy to find out what I got. This latest update took the app off of my watch (series 2). I don’t know if it was an accident or not but having the game on my watch was one of the best things about the game for me. That sneaky aspect that didn’t decimate my phone battery. Please fix this guys.
Living in the rural area is very tough playing this game, we have to drive to the nearest town to go to poke stops an gyms. Please make Pokémon pop up more while in a vehicle because that crippled our game play tremendously . Plus the variety of Pokémon that spawn when you can’t go nowhere is very limited. Please think about rural players
I tried making an account for an hour and it wouldn't work, then i got the account and activated it and I have the correct password and username and it does not sign me in. Im hella mad honestly
Maybe it’s due to the different design, but it’s far, far more difficult to throw balls on the iPhone X and you actually cannot reach Kyogre and Groudon on it. Please fix this! The game is far less enjoyable as pokeballs don’t work as well and it’s awful  Also, every time I go to a gym and feed berries to the pokemon there, game freezes 
The last few releases have been horrible. Game freezes after feeding berries to creatures in gyms. Game freezes after interacting with gyms. Etc. stop giving Niantic money until they fix the basics!
You only get ONE RAID PASS A DAY, and when I throw a curveball that hits a JUMPING LAPRAS AND I GET AN EXCELLENT THROW MEANWHILE THE LAPRAS HAS A SUPER BERRY AND IT BREAKS OUT AT ON WIGGLE IS COMPLETE BULL. Also, fix the money making mechanic cause gyms go down ALL THE TIME. I HAVE TO FIND A DESOLATE GYM TO GET A FEW COINS BEFORE SOME ONE USING THE HACK DESTROYS IT AND PUTS IN A DRAGONITE. Also you should have premier balls lay over if you don’t use them all.
It was fun for a time. In fact it was fun until yesterday when it insisted I log out and then the hassle began. I logged out and it wouldn’t allow me back in. The only way to go back to my account was created a new account...which meant nothing saves, nothing I had collected. I had literally collected things from the entire country because i spent a year traveling in an RV. Yeah now it’s useless and not fun starting over. No time to start fresh. Someone created an update that broke it for me.
I have had Pokémon Go ever since it first came out , and I’ve loved it through all of its ups and downs , and I’ve always had a blast with it . However after getting my new phone and redownloading it , I realized an issue that I didn’t have before . At first I thought it might’ve been an issue with my phone , but after logging in on a friend’s phone , she had the same issue . The GPS detection / location detection is very askew ; it shows me moving a bit when I’m not moving , shows me in the wrong location and doesn’t correct it , and shows me NOT moving when I am moving , even when I’m walking and not in the car . I tolerate the issue but it makes it very much a challenge when trying to catch Pokémon or get to Pokéstops . If there’s any way to correct the issue , it’d be perfect ! It’s only a slight flaw but it’s very hindering to the game experience unfortunately .
I love Pokemon Go. Their app does the best it can with so much going on.  It seems the latest update completely slows down the process of evolving and transferring. If you’re alphabetically sorted in your list and you transfer a pidgey for example, it takes you all the way back up to the top of the list to the “A’s”- not where you were. Same with evolving! The list no longer allows you to stay were you want to be and need to be. Continuously throws you back up to top. Pls help us Niantic. We enjoy your game/life.
I have this on my iPod it is fully updated and ready to go with my XFINITY wi-fi instead of data.  But it won't update on my iPad and that's required to use the app.  Also I live in a small area and there is like 2 pokestops in the entire area.  And that really angers me because there's 3 schools, 4 sports feilds and more.  (The area is Lower Township)
Recently, the player still doesn’t move when I’m riding in a vehicle. I’ve never had this issue before. Please fix it!
I love this game. Brings me back to when Pokémon first came out. Thank you so much for fixing the most recent issues of logging in.
Dear Pokémon,  You guys have a really good game but there are some things you really need to fix. One thing is that the Pokémon you can’t catch you throw a ball and shakes 2 times and breaks out and doesn’t run I did this on a bayleef. Another is you will walk and stop some where and then you will be a hundred feet from where ever you go in the real world.  Thanks! 
Please more gym and pokestop in Tehran 😭😭there is nothing here
The game gets a lot of errors and I wish they would give you more candies for walking with your buddy but if you can get past those two things the game is pretty good.
Only works every other day! A dying game.
So I was playing and battling a groudon with my friends and then my game started lagging and then it quit the app. I played at the last 2 minutes of the raid because of the (VERY dumb) new 45 minute rule instead of the 1 hour.  But this happened quite often and I normally just come back to collect my rewards at the end. But then the timer ran out and I was the only one who didn’t get the xp , 5 rare candies and the rest of my things and any chance of getting a groudon. GIVE ME MY STUFF. GIVE ME MY PASS BACK. GIVE ME THE CANDIES. GIVE ME MY GROUDON I BATTLED HARD FOR (Sorry for the caps) AND ALSO PLEASE FIX THIS. (one star for now until you fix the problem) Niantic, if you finally decide to fix this problem and give me my stuff I worked hard to earn. My account name is jamiedapro12345.
Great game! In my opinion probably the greatest gaming app I’ve ever played. Never was into Pokémon until this game. I still don’t watch it or collect the cards but this game as kept my interest since it was released. There’s a few things I’d personally tweak on it but they are constantly evolving the game and making it better. They always have special events that keeps you interested and excited to play. My children and I have meet a lot of really good people and made a few friends,all because of Pokémon Go. Down load and enjoy
After this recent update the game has been freezing on me and I have to restart it ever 5 mins
The last month or so, feeding berries to gym-dwellers has routinely crashed the app. One berry is usually safe, but more than that is a risk.
I’ve always been a Pokémon fan since a kid (both Nintendo & Niantic versions). But people have jobs, schools, families, work travels, etc.  PokémonGo’s becoming like a 2nd job now :(  I recently missed by 1st legendary (Kyogre) eventhough I’ve tried to raid it during weekends & as much free time I can get.  Can legendary time raids be extended? Also, like other fans have been saying, not everyone lives in large cities.  I hope Niantic will try to accommodate & listen to its gamers/fans requests — so that everyone can continue enjoying the game.  I know gamers/fans keep purchasing at the in-app PokéShop, but slow down a bit. :/
Please please bring back the legendary birds the reason I am playing Pokémon go because they had my favorite legendary please bring back the birds as soon as possible
And shows A Black screen Blink Please Fix
Please make game compatible with iPhone X
I have been playing the game since it started in July 2016, but sadly it has become to frustrating to continue playing when the game literally freezes every 5 min. Niantic takes months to fix glitches. I’m over it!
•notes pop up while try to catch Pokémon •incense don't work any better than not using it  •pokeballs wasted every time trying to catch a less common pokemon, always waste 3 at least  •get alerts that theres a pokemon so i look around but theres nothing there •takes a wat to long to load and open the app •not worth it 
Watch where you play this crap, you losers, and stay off private property!
please add more pokéstops new grasslands instead of just sites i live in the country and theirs nothing around me and it ruins the game pls fix
I love this game, but now that I’ve reached the final level, there’s a sense of anticlimax. No need to buy lucky eggs anymore, not unless Niantic writes in more levels. Please do something more for your longtime fans. Or enable peer trades: then I might be inclined to start over.
This app has brought me entertainment, but it has given me even more grief.  I can almost guarantee Niantic throttles the difficulty in catching Pokémon based on how many pokeballs you have — I.e. the more pokeballs you have, the harder it is to catch the Pokémon, therefore making you use more than you should and possibly influencing you to spend money on more pokeballs. Not to mention the bugs that literally just don’t let you catch the Pokémon.  Example: my friend and I do an electabuzz raid. She catches it in two tries. I use all 12 balls, all the gold berries, even more berries of my own, throw great to excellent pokeballs, and he comes out after two shakes. Every single time. Literally after every two shakes.  Of course the constant “error 2, error 24, error 29, error (choose a number)” is also very annoying.  I am just tired of trying to play a cool-idea-of-an-app and having it constantly taking craps on me.  SO GOODBYE POKÉMON GO, you not letting me sign-in today for literally no reason at all was the sign I needed to inform me to stop playing this terrible excuse for a Pokémon game. SEE YA NEVER AGAIN HOPEFULLY ✌🏿 
Can’t login after doing latest Pokémon update today on my iPhone. I have latest iOS version.
It keeps kicking me out, and won’t let me log in. “Authentication error, please try again.” It drives me crazy, and won’t let me log in for hours, if even.
Get rid of the speed lock most of the year for us is cold so I don’t want to walk around in the cold I wanna be able to be in the passenger seat and play Pokémon
Hi help me please I play this everyday and I just did an update 5 minutes ago and it won’t ler me open the app help!!!
I can’t believe how ridiculous this game is!!! You spend money just for the very next time u load the app to tell you failed login over and over and then even though you know your typing the correct password you reset it just for it to then tell you unable to authenticate??? You have got to be kidding me!!! I will never spend another cent in this game EVER!!!
How come the game won’t let players to log in after the latest App update?  You really need to have a good app dev team and QA team! How could it pass UAT test and published live? 
On my Iphone7plus still can not log in and can’t do anything better review once fixed
Wow, the special events are so “special”  I can’t even tell you what they are anymore.   The Valentine’s update has come and gone, whoopie.   Now I can’t even get back in after having to restart the app like I have to do every day because it loses the GPS. It just spins and goes no where. Another day lost.   Do I have any legendaries from raids?  No, because apparently people in my area don't play any more. Too rural, and we don’t matter. Niantic could care less.   I don’t even know why I still play. 
New update can’t log on
Come on guys, get with the program.
I have played this game for about a year and the software has gone from unreliable to poor to now unplayable.  I don’t even bother to try using WiFi connections, since that just results in a crash.  Even on cell in a major city, it is not stable and constant restarts are necessary.  It’s sloppy software that just wastes your time.  Don’t bother.
I grew up watching Pokémon and downloaded this game when t first came out. But there are a few issues that should have been easily fixed and things that should’ve been added some time ago.  1) Fix your servers!! I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been in an area where I have a full signal and/or strong WiFi but yet the game servers are pathetic and don’t work. Then you have to close the game, go back in, and try it again. This costs you Pokémon and items that you could’ve gotten. 2) Rural players are being forgotten and left out of most of not all events 3) Add individual quests 4) Some players may be too far away from gyms. Allow players to battle each other outside of gyms 5) Love the weather conditions update! However, during certain conditions, (mainly windy), a lot of the listed types do not appear at all. It is mainly dragon-types.  I hope you will think of your players and fix these issues. 
I can’t seem to connect to the servers to play the game. I really enjoyed the game but right now it’s unplayable.
Why on bloody earth would you cancel the supportage for certain iOS phones?! I cannot afford a newer class phone of that type! Well, I guess it's time to delete it then, that's all I can do at this point!
This doesn’t get past the google sign in you need to fix this this app might shut down
after update the app does not open. I can not log in
Logs you out then you can’t sign it it’s so stupid
Super fun game yr hat my husband and I play together. We have a blast. With earlier updates, my main complaint was what it took FOREVER for the app to load. Now, with the most recent update, it won't open at all. Please fix it!
This app takes effing forever to load now i hate it
I just wanna play manage your severs
I’ve been playing since it was started and haven’t had many problems with the app up until recently. I have not been to log in to the app unless I’m connected to WiFi so that defeats the purpose of hunting for the Pokémon.
Between not being able to catch legendary’s an the game crashing idk what’s worse, maybe you should fix this or start refunding people.
This game had great potential, spoiled by lazy developers.
I tride evolving my torchic and instead of evolving it just swallowed my candys and now the app does not even load up more then half way
Not sure what happened but I’m betting it’s the latest update?
Fix the bugs and stabilize the app please.
Niantic needs to make Pokémon have trading
Its not fair how in the games characters have crazy color hair like pink and green, but the only colors we get are blue and purple. Please add more hair color choices! Also Im with the rural players. This new update with pokemon at pokestops nearby indicator is a shameless advertisement model. In the games, pokemon are wild and you dont find all that many near cities and such. Its silly to just cement them to poke stops. I understand it’s to prevent you guys from getting sued if some dummy tried to catch a pikachu out in the street or something, so you guys chose shops and poke stops so it’s safer and also you can “advertise” with business partners. But from a player perspective, this is an unfair change. Please make it so pokemon much like the games and anime, actually appear in rural areas. Thank you for your time. BTW love the new Team Rocket update!
I’ve been with the game on and off from the beginning. Will lose interest for a few months and then try it again. I don’t think I’ll ever collect even half of the Pokémon as based on the constant new releases I can’t make headway since I’m not a constant player. Some of their updates are good, some not so much. Really do miss the grass movement to at least head in the general direction when looking. That was a VERY big complaint when it disappeared but was never addressed. Another thing is their “push” for some monsters. Right now Luvdisc is being pushed out so much that I’m not seeing much of anything else. Problem is that it doesn’t evolve so why the push to put something out there that doesn’t help? Or push out a new one that shows up fairly frequently but needs 900 candies to evolve? Theses are the things that make me shut it down periodically. It was really fun when it first came out. Not so much now.
Love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love it!
It’s been years since PoGo launched, and for some unknown reason I keep playing. This game isn’t good. The entirety of the gameplay is going around catching as many Pokémon as you can, but to do that you need to be willing to sacrifice huge amounts of time or not care about catching all the Pokémon or getting the best ones. For example, I’ve been playing since launch and I’m just barely halfway to a gyarados. The icing on the cake for me is that they just ended their last “event” completely unannounced, and now there’s no way I’m getting 400 swablu candy anytime soon.   Quick break down of different aspects: Catching Pokémon: although technically skill based, technique doesn’t feel skill based and rather feels luck based. Fun idea, but poorly executed. 3/10 Battle: Sad excuse for combat. All you do is tap as fast as you can. There is no strategy from the original Pokémon games. 
Updates ruined it
This app keeps nerfing the fun stuff or making it so hard you either can't win or it's no longer fun. I get the need to still make it challenging for players who only eat, sleep and play Pokémon go, but I have a job and those few minutes I do try, I'm losing raids, spending several minutes trying to catch one single stupid pidgey, or finding I cant compete. Enjoy raids? Now you can't get potions. Enjoy gyms? Same. Want that legendary? Too bad, if you haven't perfected your throw technique for consistent excellent throws you don't have a chance in hell. Nope- I've been playing since the beginning and I'm done now. 
I really want to love this game but the constant crashes just makes it impossible.
Every time I catch a Pokémon I have to restart my game because my gps location fails and all the Pokémon around me disappear and won’t reappear by themselves.
Pokémon Go is the best, most professional and wonderful game I have ever laid eyes on. The graphics, the story. It really gets you attached emotionally to the characters. This game is really something special, and I truly enjoyed every moment. I was fully invested in its complex, heart wrenching story. It really made me tear up when that Pidgy got away, and the character couldn’t catch him. That was his lifelong dream. And the graphics? Truly masterful. I loved when I ran into a wall that one time, captured in the beauty of everything being the exact same. I loved it. And it had a lot of replay value. This is a truly sad and very worth playing story about a character trying his/her best in the world, trying to catch em all. Great game. 5 stars.
They should add mega evolutions so that you can find mega Pokémon in the wild and by beating or capturing them you get a mega stone and mega bracelet or ring and they should have already added arceus and they need to speed up the games updates for new things but amazing game overall.
I never got the chance to go to legendary Pokémon raids and now I’ll never be able to catch any of the legendary birds or ho-oh and lugia, and Mewtwo is only in Japan so probably never gonna catch that.  Things that can change 1. Catching Pokémon is difficult when you can’t weaken the Pokémon so you just end up wasting like ten Pokéballs on it. What I think you should do is make catching Pokémon like going to a gym and battling. Just keep on tapping until it’s at low health then throw a Pokéball (also you should be able to knock them out to easily get experience) 2. A lot of people missed a lot of events (surfing Pikachu, Farfetch’d, etc) so they’ll never get any of those. Also, if people have spare Pokémon that you don’t have, and you have spare Pokémon they don’t have, then trading would be easy. To trade you should make it so you request to trade with someone and they can accept or decline. 3. A lot of people don’t have time for raid battles and won’t ever catch a legendary. So you can keep the raid battles, but can you make legendary be encounter able but really rare so people don’t have to go to raids while someone’s driving them. It’s a great game and as a Pokémon fan, I hope you expand on the Pokémon and other things that make you feel like Pokémon are here in the real world. 
Add categorizing by type of Pokémon and add trading! Update graphics! Make real “Pokémon” sounds. I love the app! Just seems like the technology could be better.
The severs are down say unable to authenticate over and over it’s stupid I haven’t been able to get on in 4 months
So I played this game for like 2 months straight but one thing that would make people get hooked again is to make it like the Ds because what is the point of caching a Pokémon if you can’t evolve it!!!!!! I am telling you if they made it like the DS i you would be playing it again.  here some of the ideas that I have that can make it better   Make it where we can fight wild Pokémon  Make it where we can evolve all the Pokémon   Make it we can have are own gym and Gym badges   Make it to ware you can add your friends and trade with them 
Can we lower all the raids including legendaries so that a single player can do them (or at least so that it takes no more than 3)? Seriously, it’s hard to get people to play together or show up at a convenient time. Not to mention there is a drama problem among quite a few of the long time players. I just want to roll up by myself or the very few people I want to play with, hit the raid, and take off. Do us and yourselves favor lower them! You’ll make more money off the raids if people can actually do them on their own time and avoid the toxic players!
I have been playing for so long, but I need them to accept Apple Pay. It is my only way to get coins at home.
I just recently got the game again. But it keeps saying that the gps signal cannot be found even though I have my location on and am connected to WiFi.
So bad is should be illegal and be shut down because it has killed more people then hiv
memes r real!1!1!1!1!!
I love all Pokémon games & this game is the most amazing Pokémon game I ever seen. But I hope if next updated will come new things like: 1- pokecentar near every gym. 2-after each battle gives us (2 to 3) count.  3- we can battle the wailed Pokémon’s because some of pokemon is strong it wasting our pokeballs. Last but not least: 4- more gyms in (K.S.A) (( Pokémon fallow is everywhere)) 🙂🙂 
So the reason why I’m rating this one star is because iPad people matter too. Some of us can’t get phones and all we have is iPads most of the people who have iPads are kids so maybe if you allowed this to be played on iPad it would be great.
I’m a huge Pokémon fan. I love all the Pokémon but I have some suggestions for an update. I was wondering if you could add the master ball to the shop for 400 pokecoins. That would be awesome. And for the raid bosses. I was wondering if you could lower Rayquaza to a number 3 and keep it’s cp when you defeat it. And add all the poke balls such as the quick balls dusk balls etc. Also if you can make an update for Pokémon ultra sun like maybe add more z-crystals or all the Pokémon from each generation.
This game is fun for a while but then if two people are done adventuring and want to test their Pokémon against each other at home it is impossible. Regular trading and battling with someone anywhere at anytime would make this game perfect even if the battles have the same system as the gym battles.
Thank you I got a shiny lovdisk today and my dad tried to do the same but his wasn’t shiny are they randomly generated and can we get more shiny Pokémon for jhoto like Mareep
I also live in a town with low population...I was invited to an ex raid..for mew-two and canceled appointments and only 3 showed up...neither of the others participated. What a waste. This new system is a par at best.  I could’ve enjoyed time with others away from the game.
Hey it’s a great game but... it has to many updates so can there be a little less updates 🤗❤️
This game is lagging more and freezing. The Pokémon go plus is not working. So annoying
For the last 2 days, my app is resetting my pokestop streak to 1 day. I missed out on my 7 days yesterday. I haven’t missed a 7 day streak since it started until now and only because of a system glitch. Even my journal shows I haven’t had any pokestops before yesterday.
The good outways the bad in this game. It is very enjoyable and has its issues. You don’t have to pay to play. You can pay, but the in game currency can be earned by putting your Pokémon in gyms. I’m glad this dev. Actually gives a crap about its players. Unlike MZ you don’t HAVE to pay to win, and I really like that.
I love Pokémon me I did love the game but this app is all over the place it is it’s ups but a lot of downs. It constantly glitches while I’m trying to catch a Pokémon and than it just drops my page and takes me back to the home page causing me to loose the Pokémon and the poke balls I wasted on it. Also when I try and pass a stop and collect it always says try again and I’m right next to it this game just makes me waist pokeballs and berries due to these glitches I feel like with all the money this app has made these types of problems shouldn’t occur I won’t be playing this for awhile until they decide to get it together
Fix the bug that won’t let you transfer Pokémon!!!
Went to summer camp at UTK and the Pokémon there was hands down amazing. Back at home in the suburbs, not so much haha. I can still catch stuff though from time to time, it just takes a little more work!
Niantic is a terrible company.  They are not game developers and have no idea what they are doing.  Please band together and force the game out of their money grabbing hands and to a developer that truly loves pokemon!
Game won’t stay open
Doesn’t work.
I logged out a week ago and I am trying to log back in and it keeps says failed to data from server so how does this work...
Still can’t battle or trade with other trainers. The loot only gets lower with ever update!! Spoofers are at all time high and cheaters !!!’ Gen 1&2 or no longer round. Only gen 3. Where are all Pokémon from gen 1&2 it like there are Extinct. Let lone get Pokémon Coins at gym need to increase!!! If your honest player this game a nightmare. Take way to long to level up once your in 20s.  This  game only gone worse... lot of my friends have stop playing..... soon I might be one. Fix game!
Pokémon go and Pokémon the series/card game have some differences CP and XP no offense but I hate CP and how you have to use candy to evolve your Pokémon I wish that it could have a battle XP system and use Level for evolving with this it would be a heck more fun also parties would be nice it would be a five star game but we need XP back NOW!!!!
Since last update every gym locks up my iPhone. And Poke stops no longer recognized by my Apple Watch. Very frustrating!!!
Pokémon go make people trespass on people's property where you're actually not allowed to go to either might get shot or might go into traffic where people are driving without looking  or the drive  while playing Pokémon go because they don't care about the notification that you do not drive a car but people don't care about everything they say about Pokémon go like will it kill people like it makes people trespass on other people's property or they might get hit by a car
Pokémon Go has been giving me a lot of problems lately. It keeps on saying error (26) and sometimes I can’t log in
I’ve been having trouble trying to use the app but apparently it cannot detect my gps. Please help
It won’t let me sign in it will just keep loading plz fix it
I ended up getting kicked out of my game, and I’ve progressed fairly in that game, but then I got kicked out and ended up not being able to get back in. 1 Star.
The game freezes every time you want to feed the other Pokémon’s players.
I've been playing it since it was released and I travel a lot so I can find reginal Pokémon and in a raid for articuno for the 5th try I caught it and I was so happy and here's a suggestion: Make a battle mode where you can bet your Pokémon and if you win you get the other persons Pokémon and if you lose the other way around of what I said and you could be with a buddy to help you
Since I started playing Pokémon Go again it started getting buggy and this never happened before during the summer when I first started playing it.
Freezes up constantly on new phone. Can’t play more than 2-3 mins before having to restart.
Game is a great concept with iconic characters... how could this go wrong?  1.) constant screen errors 2.) gives no perks to rural players. Couldn’t you offer bonuses for walking a kilometer such as a few items popping up or have additional Pokémon spawn near you? 3.) short raid times. Why shorten to 45 minutes? 4.) no addition of pvp. 5.) constant screen errors again! Network is fine and my other apps work fine in areas... 
So here recently my avatar keeps running all over the place without me moving, at my work place there’s two poke stops and I am usually able to get both of them and my avatar stays at that area but now keeps running away from the area and doesn’t come back to that area with the poke stops. Hopefully I’m not the only with this problem cuz it needs to be addressed
I love this game but it really pushes us to buy poke coins and when I do the purchase I don’t receive the poke coins it happend about 5 times already
I’ve played this game since it came out so I’m used to the typical game crashing, but this new update (1.61.1) needs a fix soon. On my iPhone 6S I get game freezes and crashes upon tapping a gym, feeding Pokémon on gyms, and trying to get gym stops. Expect double the amount of time than usual when taking down any gym. Very frustrating to say the least...
please help.
Don’t know why people think they figure it all out with their “theories”?! I follow diligently all the “tactics” and the catch rate for raids - seen 10, caught 1! Guys, hate to disappoint you man! This is just a game of random numbers and nothing really improve the stats! Don’t be delusional anymore!  I also noticed whichever countries I went to, only Asians are playing so I don’t know why they implement daylights savings worldwide? It kind of suggests the develops are amateurs with no Geo-political knowledge, else it just means that they have better sales in the weekends because working adult players are not able to raid so they pay more in weekends to catch up.  Despite above, I realised I still spending money on this game because my Wife is still playing this game. Thanks to this game, at least can help my Wife to walk more 
I just want to catch only gen 1 Pokemon
I love pokèmon because they have added New Pokémon. Downtown has much more Pokémon stops. And today I caught like millions of birds. I need more pokecoins.😻😻😻😻😻😻 you need to try it!😄
No offense but why don’t you let people play for free
Freakin amazing game. Please I just wanna trade
I've been playing since this came out and still don't have a single legendary... What's the point in trying to raid?!  Network errors wasting time energy and items... 
Please increase pokemon bag capacity. That’s all, just a little to many Pokémon to have one of each right now.
This game is still alive people still play this game it’s dead
The game it’s self is awesome! 😍 but.... today I found a bug a really annoying bug. So I was in the car (as a passenger) was I playing Pokémon go and my person wouldn’t move this caused me to miss many pokestops and gyms etc! So I closed the game and reloaded it, it didn’t work! I tryed it a second time it didn’t work, I tryed it a third and final time it still didn’t work. Please fix this bug as it’s really annoying
Still buggy, but the game has continued to improve.
I was actually pretty happy to come back to Pokémon Go for a while with the faster loading and better response times - but the “news” pop-up makes me want to throw the app away again.   If it were like the traditional announcements in that it comes up only once when you first start the app, that would be okay. But it consistently comes back without prompt, even when I’m trying to bring up menus.   I dunno. I’ll give it a couple weeks I guess, but I’m not sure how many more chances, if any more, I’m going to grant to this game. 
when you add pvp and trading i will give you five stars. the game needs to have more of a multiplayer kinda feeling to it. the single player is getting boring, yes the new raid update kinda helped with that, but you still don’t really get a chance to see how good your pokemon actually are. adding pvp and trade will change the game for the better. players will be able to be more social, make friends, and have more experience with their pokemon.
I love this game but how come after holding down a gym for a whole week , no coins were given , really disappointed.
I got hit by a car and broke my thumbs!!!! ........... how am I typing this
I had just got this game and its already amazing!!I love the new pokemon added!!😍😍 Keep up the good work 😊 😊
Still hate on players who dont live in a city. People in the middle of no where most likely own farms and grow food for you to hate on players out here. Should just spawn lots of Pokémon all over map. Make it where you can add friends. Make where players around the world can help on gyms that have bosses on earls area markers.
played this as a kid and I’ve always loved it
Pokémon Go is a way for people with a very imaginative mind to see their surroundings with Pokémon this game does get laggy sometimes but it can make family’s come closer together.
Here lately the game hasn’t been able to find my location. I have everything turned on that the game requires and it just will not work.
When feeding your Pokémon inside a gym, the game freezes after you feed them 2-3 berries. Newest version for iPhone X
This is such a great game!! It brings people together from all walks of life, get to meet new people and see how they view Pokémon. Some minor technical issues though like I’m wondering how does the catching system work relating to Pokémon and their IV’s and CP’s and once if your over a certain level do all Pokémon become the exact same for everyone? Cause when you first brought the game to life it was everyone has the same chance to catch a Pokémon but each would be differently powered which makes sense so that not everyone has the same 100% IV Dragonite per say only a certain few might be as lucky to catch that one perfect one. A little insight would be greatly appreciated but a very solid and fun and amazing game to say the least!!  Thank You Niantic!! 
When opening the app, on the loading screen the app will literally freeze and when going to a Gym. Also the potions that are in the store are Max Potions, and Gyms and Pokéstops doesn’t give you enough potions, it only gives you 1 or 2 potions. And 1 last thing, we should be able to power up our Pokémon’s attack and special attack power because it’s disappointing struggling to get candies and finally evolve your Pokémon only to find out it’s not that powerful. Please fix this.
It won’t let me catch my starting Pokémon
The game crashes and freezes randomly. Most of the time the game lags or tells me that it’s unable to authenticate forcing me to close out the game and restart it. I opened my account using the Pokémon trainers club and have been playing the game for a long time. I realized that I should have created an account using the google method instead.  All of my friends that created an account using google don’t have the same problems/issues as I do.  There were many times during a raid my game would lag or freeze while they kept playing.  There were so many raids that I lost out on because of these issues.  Niantic needs to update or perform maintenance on their servers or something.
I just recently moved to the Midwest and unlike NYC we need to drive to get anywhere. I would have to walk 4 miles just to get to a pokemon stop. It would be great if there were more poke-stops or no limitation on speed (im always a passenger).
I’m giving it a 1 because when ever I go on it always says no signal all the time and I can never play
I’m Pokémon trainer from a village of Viet Nam. But there isn’t any gyms to collect balls so that I can’t catch more monsters, which makes me disappointing. I hope the creator can open some gyms for people who live in small town or village to get chance to play. Wait for your response.
Didn't get to battle him at all was really hoping to get him and challenge mewtwo in battle but never let me in even with my invite waist of time not worth playing hope it gets fixed.
This Game is Number 4 in my hart 😍 TY FOR KOREAN
Well, new Pokemon mean I'm back. But I, like others, am a solo player and with the raids are shut out of the legendary Pokemon. I cannot win a raid against a legendary by myself. The first round of legendary Pokemon came and went. I saw them but had zero chance to get them. Once, and only once, two other people showed up to battle Zapdos. No luck, we couldn't defeat it. All the other times, I was by myself, even at a community college. Since then, Niantic keeps releasing them through the raid system. Worthless!!! I can never get one. Strange, these are supposed to be ultra rare and legendary yet some people have 5, 10 even 20 of EACH legendary and I have zero!!! Why??? I'm a solo player and Niantic doesn't care. They do more to exclude than help. Ex raids are not exclusive, they are excluding!!! Basically I am not worthy to have one per Niantic. I do not waste my time with raids I cannot win but I did hatch 1,500 eggs. But that does not count I guess. Please, enough with the legendary raids already and release them where a solo player like me have a chance. The only reason you keep doing this is all money driven. So, I will not pay for raids I cannot win BUT, I would pay $5 or $10 for a legendary incubator to hatch a 50 km egg to hatch a legendary. Niantic said months ago they knew it was not fair for rural or solo players and they have improved spawns but have done absolutely nothing to help solo or rural players when it comes to legendary Pokemon. A game should be fair to everyone and not different between locations. Love Pokemon, hate raids and legendary release. DO SOMETHING!!  Update: still no changes with legendary raids so no legendary Pokémon for me! So annoying. 
It needs to be so that you can play it with no wi-fi
I love this game but Bc of the rural problem of where people that live in rural areas don’t get the same advantage as others there should be a way of making your house a pokestop that only your account can see that way It will be fair for all
The last 2 updates have not worked for me, as Location Services won’t work with this app. I’ve already tried logging out and in again, and have reinstalled the app twice, but nothing works. Such a shame since it’s happening while Gen 3 is continuing to roll out.
Some of the original avatar customization have been removed from the game. Please bring them back.  PLEASE BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL 3 step tracker!!!! 
Unlike other mobile games this game makes you go places and I love it some people wouldn’t even known of some places if it weren’t for Pokémon go
My character won’t move and the all Pokémon are underneath him and he won’t move😒
I wish you able to have more than one rade pass a day or it should be cheaper in the store
Pokémon GO is one of my favorite games. Having a big collection of cute and strong Pokémon is probably someone’s destiny. But I have one bug that annoys me a lot!  Sometimes I play when my dad drives the car. Not a good idea I suppose but when I get near a poke stop I spin the disc and it will say ‘Try Again Later’ Then I get nothing from the poke stop. I get rlly annoyed by it because I rlly need more items! It might be caused because the car goes too quickly so the game can’t handle it but I don’t think that is the reason. So I please beg Niantic to fix this plz? Cause that would be great!!!!!!!!!!! 
I don’t like this game because I have never played this game before and I can’t sign in so yea Pokémon go needs to work on that
I love this game but recently anytime I go to interact with a gym my game will freeze and I have to restart the app to continue, please fix this, otherwise great game
The game is fun and I still enjoy playing it but some of the things are getting lame and repetitive. The biggest thing lately thought is the 400 candies needs to evolve crap Pokémon. I’m sure everyone in the game can attest that getting 400 Magikarp candies was worth the wait, seeing as a 150 Magikarp would evolve into a 2700 Gyrados. But with the Wailmer, who evolves from 1000 to 1800 and the Swablu that doesn’t even evolve past 1000. What is the point? That’s a lot of time trying to collect 400 candies for a very bad return! Also change up the recommended battle teams when fighting a raid boss. You recommend this based on whose is enhanced by the weather, not necessarily by who has the best type advantage. Several times I have gone with the recommended Pokémon and they aren’t effective at all.
I caught luvdisc but when I caught it,it turned into duskull?!!!!! Fix it
Basically EVERYTHING pops out of the pokéball at least once, if not twice. I also tried to evolve something (Wurmple) and the when I clicked evolve the candies went down but nothing happened. The screen didn’t change and it didn’t evolve. I just lost candies.
Every time I tried to delete a Pokémon it bogs out
I love Pokémon!😍 But I could never get passed the sign in screen which is sad! I hope you got that because I love love love Pokémon!
I hate it so much
You guys did an amazing job with this game but can we add pvp outside of the gym. Lets make it exciting
Today my app has been crashing very frequently for no reason. It has not been like this yesterday only today. The new update has been up for almost a week now but i had no problem with it until today. Note i do play with an iPhone 6 but i do have an LG Aristo but i does not crash on that until today Sunday, Feb 11, 2018. Maybe to stop random crashes maybe add a Graphics Smoother so not many people with older phone models will experience what i just did today. It can help me and the majority of people that play and enjoy Pokemon Go. This is exceptionally weird, but thank you for taking your time to read this review :)
Once you get to a higher level, you end up catching 1 Pokémon after every three you catch. And when you give so many attempts and throw as much as you can, if it flees...you have just lost around 10 poke balls that you tried to use to catch it. Not only that, but you continue to do this and you lose pokeballs and you run out. This causes you to BUY IN THE GAME (Like EA) just so you can get good at the game. So if there was a way to rate lower, I would. I didn’t even add how long it takes the get in the game.
Feressh/:
The poke coin cap of 50 a day is really lame, I get you’re trying to make money but it should at least be bumped up to 100 so you can buy 1 extra raid pass a day if you’re taking several gyms a day  Also something that is mentioned fairly often through the reviews is that if you’re not in a major city it’s incredibly hard to get enough players to take down a level 4 or 5 raid. Hopefully as more ex raids happen that’ll help 
You need to implement a weekly time limit for gym occupation in the rural areas. we have one gym that one team had basically owns because they live so close. Every time any opposing team takes down the gym, it would be taken back within an hour by the geographically advantaged team.  After the update we saw that there was another gym added up for grabs. This seemed promising... until we realized that the advantaged team now has two gyms at their disposal.  There is no other way to earn coins other than by purchases, but it would be nice to have more options. 
I can not do password
Fix the login issue
The raid system actually has a purpose than just throwing your poke balls at random Pokémon all day. It’s great as a co-op system to play with friends. The rare candy drops make it so you can actually develop Pokémon you don’t see often.
This game is pretty fun. However my parents don't let me get data so I basically have to do everything from in my house super annoying help?
I got back onto Pokémon cause of Rayray and so far the day been okay until now. The last 30 Pokémon I tried to catch all ran always. I remember them doing this for cheaters but sorry to inform you I’m not one of them but that’s okay. This isn’t the first time.  Has the same issue when I moved from USA to japan. Couldn’t play for like 3 weeks cause everything kept running away. Oh well. 
No fun anymore...even my 6 years old doesn’t want to play anymore. Needs to come up with something news to draw players attention.
I like this game a whole lot but the only thing I don't like very much is that the spawn rate for Pokémon is incredibly low in rural areas. In urban areas the Pokémon are everywhere, but if you don't live near a pokestop, you get nothing. I just I wish I could play it more from home. So please "niantic" either add more pokestops or increase the spawn rate where pokestops are uncommon.
Hardly any Pokémon in my area of Northern New Jersey and no Pokestops! Please fix this as it’s a huge inconvenience to only get Pokémon near bigger urban environments, don’t Pokémon actually “live” in the wilderness??
Dear Pokémon , why is it so hard to get in your game to play . When I register every time my password is not valid and what I am saying allow players to type in their own password . You can also just make 12 digit limit instead of the things u do
My location keeps turning off for the game while im in it
I have a lot of fun playing this game, as it gets me to head outside to simulate being a Pokémon trainer. However, the only things that can be done in the game are catch Pokémon, take over gyms, and attend raids.  Going back to the first trailer, I saw that trading is to be implemented into the game. This will be very helpful to those of us looking for a certain Pokémon that is impossibly elusive for whatever reason, such as being region exclusives or simply hard to find, or items being tradable for those looking for this one item needed to evolve for example.  I’ve also been waiting for the time where I can have my Pokémon fight those of other trainers when nearby instead of fighting being gym-exclusives. This should be a fairly easy addition to put into the game, and it should definitely bring back more players if it’s added along with trading.  And lastly, I would like to know when raids of previous legendaries will return. I did get lucky and complete a Kyogre raid, but I do wish that I was able to get legendaries such as Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres. A lot of us didn’t get the opportunity to take them on and try to catch them, so if they could make a return, along with other previous legendaries, that would be great. 
Will change the review once I can actually play on my iPhone X. For now, when ever you click on a gym it will glitch. Freeze. And then has to be rebooted.
Epic!!
I’ve been playing for like a year or two now, level 38 with 4 tyranitars over 3000 cp, dragonites, tons of legendaries like groundon and kygore and the beast trio and bird trio. The thing is, I live in a rural area with like just one poke stop in sight, resulting in constant outages of poke balls, which make me just say “up, there goes my last one! Done for the day”   Niantic just doesn’t care about us rural areas right? I’m just sitting here with like a natu and a pidgey in sight. You might be thinking how did you get good things like tyranitars then? Well, a year ago I lived at this place called Santa Monica and everyday pokestops were everywhere, all lured up. Players were everywhere and every now and then we’d get some crazy spawn at the pier, like that one time I accidentally saw two donphans and a snorlax at one pokestop. I’ve analyzed the data and I don’t think it’s fair now that I live in the middle of nowhere and don’t have fun anymore.  Raids are a whole other thing. Back in santamonica  we’d have 20 people faster than you can say ‘jackrabbit’. Now I can only do level 1-2 raids and occasionally a level 3 raid.   I would like to see New update news where you bring more pokestops to rural areas. Also trading would be nice, and possibly and occasional AR Helper for raids? That would be nice.  I loved the game once Niantic. I’ve constantly nagged at you. You’ve never responded! You honestly don’t care right? Well I’m leading a boycott to the game with my friends, not by not playing it, but by hacking it. I downloaded a hack  and now Im in union square hacking all I want.   Die Niantic, unless you fix the game!!!! 
Theyve made pokemon harder to catch so players can waste their poke balls then players would have to purchase coins for balls. Noticed pokestops dont give as many poke balls as it used too!
I noticed for the last month people in the gym have Pokemon that go to full health right when you are about to knock them out of the gym. This will happen repeatedly. Plz crack down
I had 3 attempts to catch this legendary Pokémon and wasted nearly all my life savings of Pokécoins purchasing raid passes to get as many attempts to get it! I had so many excellent curve ball shots at it combined with a golden razzberry for every shot that it is unreal that I got no frickin Raquaza out of them... Because you morons made it impossible! Fix this issue now!!
I love Pokémon go, it’s interactive fun and gets me excited! I can’t wait to see what Pokémon are around and which teams have control of the gyms in my neighborhood! (Hopefully team mystic. Go team!!!!!)  the creators have really done an amazing job with the game and I realize that it is very hard to make amazing things like this. One thing they did especially well was the legendary Pokémon. It’s not easy to get and requires you to be social. This game is great! Me and loads of other players thank Niantic for this awesome game! While I do love this game there is one problem that I find especially annoying. The dreaded coin cap. Let me clarify that I do believe the coin cap is necessary so people aren’t earning a crazy amount each day. The problem I have with it, is that if you have a Pokémon return after spending days in the gym, it can only give you fifty coins, even if it earned more while it was in there. I think there should be a way to collect the coins the Pokémon earns each day, without taking it out of the gym. I think what you can do to fix this, is to make it so a Pokémon can only earn fifty coins a day. Once the Pokémon reaches fifty it will stop accumulating coins. You can then collect them, but you won’t be able to get anymore coins for the day. So if you have multiple Pokémon in gyms, you just have to wait until the next day when you can collect their coins from them. Immediately after the coins are collected the Pokémon will start earning coins again. Despite my dislike of the coin situation I love the game and I’ll deal with the fifty coins per Pokémon thing if I really need to. Thanks for reading, please take this review into consideration because I do believe others are frustrated about this as well. Thanks so much. 
Please fix your catch rates. I can find myself excellent curveball golden razzing some pokes and STILL not catching it when i turn around to see somebody do nothing but throw and catch it. It’s so stupid PLEASE FIXXXXX
I live in a town with 1,500 people.  I can almost promise I am 1 of 5 people who might still play.  It’s impossible for me to do anything really.  To progress further in the game is also almost impossible.  Gotta help us little people out a bit too.
The game overall is good but I can’t catch any raid Pokémon, my brother catches like everything and I can catch nothing, I use golden berries and hit the Pokémon with raid balls but can’t catch it
I love pokemon and I absolutely want to play this but it’s impossible and completely unplayable when living in a VERY rural community. I’m pretty much a 15 minute drive from a very small town with nothing between here and there. I also have zero pokeballs and with pokestops being the only way to get them (aside from buying them) and Gyms being the only way to get coins (again aside from spending REAL money on them) I can’t do anything with any pokemon that actually show up around here. All in all, this game is only playable for people in cities and that just makes me sad. Wish there were more thoughts for players in rural areas because as is, it’s completely unplayable.
The game is great but I have been waiting for a long time to get my favorite Pokémon mew can u please send me one in return mew is so cute
There should be single player missions that you can complete so you can get raid buffs that either reduce the strength of the boss or boost your Pokémon. I will never get 8 people together at the same time to raid where I live. Maybe a buff for walking 5 miles in a day? Catch 100 Pokémon? Spin 200 pokestops? There needs to be buffs for the people who can’t reliably play with other people. If not, I will never catch a legendary Pokémon. It’s very disheartening when all I want is to catch them all.
I like this game but every time I hatch and egg it is something bad or something I have the only time there is something good is once and a blue moon
Do most players prefer meditation during forcequit/restart to actual play?  This latest update seems to be designed to accommodate that preference.
personally I Like this game more than Minecraft and I Love Minecraft I don't actually use my device I use my mom's phone I don't have a phone yet but I want One!!!!!!!!!!!!
The last update made raids with a iPhone X near-impossible. Because of the way they zoomed things in, it’s very hard to throw against far raid bosses and now AR+ is almost impossible too. The meter shoots up without moving and it flees back to the grass before you can throw a ball. Do not spend any money on premium passes.
So I was using a lucky egg evolving about 60 Pokémon and I evolved one and it was my last that I planed doing and I got an error and lost everything I got a lot of was new and ones I worked on to evolve and I lost all the candy so I could just redo it later after catching them again. I’m lvl 32 put money into this game and can’t even get help besides have to post on here so I’m completely done with this game thanks for all the wasted time
I love Pokémon go and every thing is amazing! So many new Pokémon and all the updates help it so much!
I mean I’ve been playing this game since it came out but the raids new pokemon its fun but its starting to get boring I mean come on!! Am I right even sonic forces is gunner then this no offense 😕😕 I still think they should add trading using pokemon to fight other pokemon to catch them it boring just throwing balls🤣🤣🤣🤣😆😆😆🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 Ok so I hope my points are right I mean I’m just a ruale player
If you played on iPhones before, Those days are over. The depth perception on the x is horrible as Niantics solution was only to zoom in the screen not correctly portion it for the odd ration of the X.
The spawn rate in rural areas is way too low to play this game. Developers need to fix this so this game is fair for all audience and not just focusing on the urban audience.
I love the game but I wish that I could be in the car while I Pokémon hunt and it is hard to get coins!
I love this game it's so fun and the Pokémon are cute!! But the only thing I don't like is that you have to walk to where the picture is on the poke stop
I need trades
Updates keep rolling
I’ve paid a few times to upgrade my storage play Pokémon go when the new update arrived with new Pokémon my storage do not increase It Stayed the same as it was before the update word extra slots that I paid for
Thats all i have to say
I like the game but you need wi Fi
Since I was forced to update I have had to restart my app 7 times in the span of an hour and a half due to the app freezing up.
Such a cool game
I’m always excited about the new updates and this is my favorite game but there should be a way to buy more balls.
I’d even do it for free. Here me out: Another hair style option. 😱🤯 I know. It’s amazing.
When it says update needed it doesn’t let you update even when it was updated the week before it makes me mad ☹️
For some reason it won’t show the update on my device????????????
Hi I’m Ryan I’m level31 and Senece the new update I think the game is a lot better than it was before it’s a great game and it’s cool how they have raids and a great improvement would be being able to trade Pokemon and items . Five stars.                   Ps I’m a kid 💩
i wish we could have more of the stuff we used to live in the original games! i want pokémon battles!
App crash in GYM!!!! iPhone 5s
See title
I cant even play the game anymore! Niantic is so concerned with people speeding while playing they added a speed cap, which was annoying enough. Now, when you go to load the app, if your character even moves a step you can't play the game. It's really gone downhill. Awful job, guys. awful, awful, awful.
Ever since I was born I loved playing pokemon
This game is one of the best things that ever happened to me, but there is a bug with the “nearby” radar that at random times, causes everything on it to disappear even if there’s still things sopposed to be on it. The raid boss switch is also a big drag and nothing is worth doing anymore. Absol isn’t even worth looking for as it hardly ever is a raid. Instead of making the game more torturous, like making us grind 400 candies for a wailord, raiding daily and never getting an EX pass, give us stuff we’ll care about like trading (which you advertised before the game came out and we still don’t have it), PVP, Mew, the rest of gen 3 and last but definitely not least, bringing back older legendaries such as the birds, and lugia, and the dogs. And this game is aimed at kids right? THEN LET THEM SEE SPONSORED POKESTOPS AND GYMS FOR A BETTER EXPERIENCE!!
You have to walk and stand on stuff
You need to let us change our teams at least once. I want to be valor, not instinct.
All of my previous complaints, while still true, are irrelevant in comparison to a professionally-developed game being so completely and unforgivably unstable.  Aside from that, gameplay and challenge are lacking in most categories. Would not recommend. 
Is a really bad app because I can’t even play. it it says on the username and password it’s incorrect.
I think a lot of the reasons people don’t like this game (having to do lots of raids, difficult to do much without traveling a lot, etc.) are actually selling points for me rather than negatives. I love how Pokémon Go has forced me to go out of the house and check out local landmarks, parks, and try to find people to raid with. I’ve even made some new friends through this game. The one reason I cannot give it a perfect score is that while it has improved a LOT since its initial release, it still has problems. The battle mechanics are a little too simplistic, and the recent update makes revives a tad too hard to get. And of course rural players still have a lot of difficulty playing. The thing is (aside from the revives thing) I’m not sure how I would solve these problems. The battle system cannot get nearly as complicated as the main series games or else it would be hard to play on the go, and rural areas are lacking in local landmarks and walkability to begin with. So I cannot hate on the game for these flaws too much. 
Love playing Pokémon Go, I have a huge issue. For about a month now I have not received any potions from pokestops, and it’s become very annoying if I want to do gyms. The only ones I have received was from leveling up, but I need more than 10 if I want to continue to partake in gym battles. Love the weather upgrade that’s a plus.
I love pokemon. But pokemon go seems almost real. So that makes it awesome!
Look it takes a lot of Pokémon hunting to level up. Please consider to reward the players that do. The items that you received when leveling are not what I expected. I love this game, it’s fun to relive those moments when you played on your game boy. That’s my only critic. The items need to be a little more wowing to the players. Especially when you’re spending the money to continue to have fun in this game. Thanks Niantic
Game freezes, getting random error messages.  Love the game just needs a patch sent ASAP! 
First, this game got me outside and moving - the original intent. I still enjoy walking with it as it gives me something to do. I even purchased the Pokémon Go Plus device to go with it.   At this point the latest update includes a fabulous screen crash when feeding berries at gyms. 
Okay. There is a lot to both praise and criticize about this game. But the intense focus on raiding is absolutely killing this game in all but the busiest areas. To raid, you need more people to play with. To find more people to play with, you have to use some sort of outside app or similar to find people to meet up with. But hey guess what, if you don’t know how to do that, or if you live somewhere where there aren’t many people playing anymore, or if you can’t drop everything to go raid when an egg pops up, or you can’t drive, or any of an endless list of other reasons, then hey- tough for you cuz you don’t live in a city with tons of players. It is so utterly upsetting that the only way to get all legendaries and even some regular old Pokémon (absol, mawile) is raiding. So you’re just straight up screwed if you can’t play that way. When this game was released it seemed more like it would be about getting out in nature when you can and to see what’s out there. Now it’s “chat with strangers until you all meet up and spend money on raid passes.” It’s just horrible.
The game keeps logging me out when I first try and turn it on.
I’ve been playing Pokémon go since it first came out. There have probably only been 2 game apps I’ve ever used for this long.  There are two things I’m currently unhappy about. How difficult it is for rural players to get some action. It is at least 5 miles to the closest pokestop—-there’s no way of walking that far, which I thought was the main idea of PG (getting people more active). There is NO Pokemon spawning near my home.  I can walk from one end of my road to the other end and there are 2 spots where they spawn. 2 lousy spots. Once I catch what’s there, it takes a while for a new one to spawn so what am I supposed to do? Turn around and walk the miles again for 2 more Pokemon? And the raid battles. There is no way on earth that a small town will ever get 17-20 people together to catch a legendary out here. It’s impossible even with social media.  My second complaint is the lack of revives! I understand that you want to make money on the game but come on!  Pokémon go is one of the few games I have spent money on. I have mainly bought lucky eggs and incubators.  No way am I gonna sink money into revives. I guess when all my Pokémon faint I will just quit the game. It wouldn’t be as bad if there was a way to earn coins in the game. I used to earn a few coins by defending gyms but you hardly earn any coins currently.
The game is cool, but I can’t get all the cool legendaries like Rayquza because not very many people in my town play. It’s hard to get that many people to come and do a raid battle.
Nice
I love this game and it still gets five stars froM me.but where are the raids I gotta thought with the update we could get new legendary Pokémon.
The new gym concept isn’t working, and there really should be better Pokémon on the game. If I had a penny for every geodude, growlithe, sandshrew, houndoore, pidgey, and snubble I’d be rich. It would be nice to not have to link up with 15-20 other people to catch a legendary! The raids are cool, but also not particularly much fun when you don’t belong to a group...
I was playing the game fine this morning. When I went to the app again this afternoon, it asks me to update to continue. I already updated the app 3 days ago. Can’t you see that if you have an update ready, you have to bring it to the App Store? This is ridiculous and driving players insane. Send an update and everyone can update it and continue playing the game. Otherwise, we are deleting the game and you’re losing fans pretty soon. 😤😤😤
My game keeps freezing when I go into a gym and press a Pokémon to feed it berries
The only app that sends me annoying push notifications at night. Deleted.
I can’t meet up with others very often. The drive and excitement to keep playing gyms is completely gone. I stop at the Church around the corner out here in the sticks and spin once and catch a few Pokemon. That is the extent of it and I played the gyms all day long at times.
Look Pokémon go When I go to pick a starter there in one place and I can’t catch them so that is why in put one star
I love this game a lot and I really mean it but I keep losing my accounts. No matter what I do it sends me to my ‘test’ account when I first saw the game. It will not let me go back to my other accounts and I’m very upset over this.
This release is very buggy and possibly has memory leak. If you visit gyms a couple of times, the app will freeze.   Also the rules of battling and defending gyms are very discouraging. 
Every time I’m waking my avatar doesn’t walk it stays in the same place please fix this :(
All was well until it bricked my phone and it refused to update.
Pokemon Go really needs to integrate a friends system, trading, trainer battles, etc. It would add many more users and make the game way more fun. Just sayingn
Today I purchased 3 incubators but only 2 showed up in my items list, this is not the 1st time this has happened to me
Just updated today, and now it’s freezing left and right
I enjoy the game but i hate that we are forced to update, what if i dont like the new update?
The current update to the app is messing with gps locations. The only fix I’ve found for it is to delete and reinstall the app everytime the issue happens.
Awesome game, basically flawless, but I live out in the country. There isn't a lot spawning there, but when I drive up to a city there is. It would be great if it was more spread out, and u could still catch a lot out in the country. Still a great game 👍
It won’t let me update it and it says I have to it’s terrible
Pokémon constantly disappear. Makes you not want to play the game when it doesn’t even work properly....
We need more potions to fight gyms !
I love this game but the last update on 2-8-18, has frozen my phone three times in the first five minutes, Which makes it impossible to play, especially during a battle. So the game, up to 2-7-18 I gave five stars. With the new update the game gets, one (1) star.
I would love to see the day when you can chose a Pokémon battle with another local Pokémon Go user and also being able to trade your Pokémon with other local users!!!!!!
Please when you make a pokémon your buddy let the buddy pokémon walk or run or whatever your character is doing and if it is small let it be on your shoulder
I can’t even log in So bad game!!!😠 
Definitely love running around searching for Pokémon, but living in the country makes it hard to fully experience the game. I’m lucky enough to live next to the only PokeStop for nearly 20 miles! Please don’t punish us rural fans who love Pokémon Go just as much as anyone. Pokémon do live in the wild!
Can you please allow emoji use in names?  👍 thanks
Enjoy but would really like an option for 1v1 battles with random people
This app meets my expectations and is fun to play
I love Pokemon go but I live in a smaller town so it's rare that we get enough people to do a raid.
I’m in a town where 90% is Mystic and I mistakenly chose Valor there needs to be a one time thing like the player name change where us players who are completely outnumbered can change teams. Having worked so hard for a gym and then having it immediately snatched from you with no coins is so disheartening. Plus it’s impossible to get legendary Pokémon in a small area. Please consider making some of these changes I’ve been playing since day one and am proud to see how far this app has come but it still needs work to be fair to everyone playing.
I am quitting this game. The problems never get fixed. You make it hard for single players and you wont stop Account sharing.  Why would I continue to pay $$ for a game that doesn’t listen to it’s players. Adding new Pokémon, isn’t the problem. It just covers up the underlining problems.  Until you fix what needs to be fixed, I’m going else where. XoXo 💋 
With the game and that is when I feel a vibration every once and a while inside the Pokédex or looking for Pokémon I click outta my Pokédex or I look and nothing’s there even though I felt a vibration
I love Pokémon Go as Pokémon has always been a huge part of my childhood. Recently though, I can’t seem to get a GPS signal anywhere. I’m not sure if this is a bug or not but please fix it soon!
This game is a really great game. I love it! There are a couple things I dislike and are having trouble with.   First, there’s only one gym in my area! So raids happen like less than twice a month! This makes things frustrating. There’s also only about five or more poke-stops.  Places like California though, have a gym on every corner and like three pokes tops per street. Please add more pokestops and gyms to areas that don’t really have that many please!  Second, I was horrible at Pokémon Go until I want to California. Please change “the balance.”   Third, whenever I get on at first, it is really glitchy and doesn’t work at first. The logo is also a little sketchy. But it’s okay.  This game is awesome and fun, except for these few minor details. Otherwise, good job Niantic! 
Thanks for all your improvements
Is that normal? Feels weird.
Seems with the new update when I switch to another app or two and come back to this one it crashes just as the screen comes up. So annoying. 🙄
This game is for you if you like Pokémon
“Invalid password.” “Must contain uppercase letter, lowercase letter, a symbol, etc.” Why?
I just like to pokey everywhere I go
Pokémon gos newest update has caused a problem with the gps not being found have to open and close it a few time to get it to work and have to open maps to get it to work and sometimes none of that works please fix ASAP
Thanks for Gen 3! I love the new Pokémon to look for. I’m 99.99% sure that there’s a Numel nest in my local park, a lot of Pokémon are easy to evolve, and are super strong. But my issue is Weather. I live where we get a TON of snow (and it’s surprisingly not Canada) but half the time it says “Cloudy” or “Partly Cloudy” when there’s a freaking BLIZZARD outside. 🤦‍♂️ Please try to get Weather right. I’m trying to hunt Aron and I need the increased spawn rate! Also, each time there’s a new Pokémon near a Pokéstop, whenever I get close to it, the whole radar just resets! And I end up waiting 10 minutes, and then it’s gone. 🤬 
Can you please make the same option for Pokémon go that you have for Apple Watch for Fitbit blaze. That would be amazing! Or at least a way to transfer your daily steps over to the game. I cannot get an iWatch right now and i know blaze doesn't have quite the same options but that would be awesome
• it would be cool if you could have your buddy actually shown walking next to you • i think it also would be cool if you could set a home so that you could have like your own little healing station/ breeding station • we definitely need to be able to breed our Pokémon that would be so fun • also i feel like when you are catching a Pokémon you should be able to do it like in the shows where you have a team of Pokémon and you have to fight the Pokémon so it had low health then you are able to catch it...  • also you when catching a Pokémon if you miss the Pokémon with a pokéball you should be able to get the pokéball back like i miss all the time so i feel like that would be really helpful especially for people like me  • oh ! Also we should be able to ride Pokémon like WHO doesn’t want to ride Pokémon but only the bigger ones like Ryhdon or Onix  ( i think i spelled Ryhdon wrong but oh well).    Other then that i love this game and its great!! 
I live in the country and I don’t go into town much. It would be nice to be able to find some Pokémon in-between houses so that you will still have to walk. Other than that great game!!!
The raid times recently implemented are downright awful. They are starting while we’re on our morning commutes, and most are finished before we can get home from work.
Recent changes made catching chances drop, run aways up.  And I get the weather warnings but hazardous weather for sunny conditions in the mid 70s to low 80s?!?! Are you kidding me?!? The last thing we need is more kids and more people in general inside sitting on their butts growing the obesity population. Take down the sunny weather warning, you want people out and about playing, not getting an excuse to not go outside. HORRIBLE IDEA! 
I set up my account when I was in college with my college edu email. I have spent so much time and money on my account to get to where I was. My college decided to deactivate my email now that I am done with school and Niantic says there is no way for them to change the email on the account. How can this be? Any other app will allow you to change email addresses. Also in emailing customer support one person said they could help but needed more info to get things switched over and I just needed to start a new request. I provided the info they needed and submitted a new request and was told there was no way of switching the email over and basically I would just have to start over.
My Favorite Part is definitely AR+. I also like Gen 3. So Cool!!!!! 
Ok so I live in ms in place that doesn’t even have one poke stop in a 20 mile radius also I’m in grade school I don’t have a car and my mom and dad aren’t willing to take me Pokémoning so I’m pretty much stuck walking around my yard all day trying to get decent Pokémon there’s also no gyms until you get to downtown Columbus come on seriously put in more gyms and more pokestops in Columbus also where are all the newer gens seriously also why do I need a Pokémon trainer club account it takes forever to setup it’s strait up stupid I don’t recommend this game if you don’t have any form of transportation you can use whenever u want if my issues were fixed I’d give it five stars but until then deal with 3
As of right now there’s no way to check your streak status. I would really like to see what # day of the streaks I’m on, in the journal. The Pokémon and the Pokéstop streak aren’t always the same for me, in the MI winters it can be hard to get out to a pokestop every day.  Hopefully developers will take into consideration, I don’t and never will raid Battle. I think this needs to be addressed as a lot of people are unhappy with the raid system (not to mention the bugs). Some players just don’t feel comfortable interacting with strangers. Some people don’t have friends who even play the game. I wish there was another way to enjoy that feature! 
Hoping for an eventual update for the iPhone X fixing the level 5 Legendary Raids. It is absolutely not possible to throw a curveball and make it reach the creature. Had no issues prior to Niantic “adding support” to the X. Need to borrow and iPhone 8 or below or use an tethered iPad for raids.
*This game is NOT for people who live in rural areas and you will definitely miss out on a lot of things/events others get to enjoy who live in big cities. Trust me!  GYM; I've been playing for a year now and have seen how the game has developed. The new gym system is pretty cool. Love the graphics and overall upgrade to it but absolutely hate that only 6 trainers can join a gym now vs. previously when 10 were allowed. I prefer the challenge of the previous 10 limit set up. It made winning over a gym that much more worth it and fun.  COINS; As if the gym cut back wasn't bad enough, the coin payout from gyms is a joke. Before you would get 100 coins per Pokémon for every gym you were defending every 24 hours or so. (5 Pokémon/ 5 gyms = 500 coins which could mean 500 coins a day) Now you can have 5 Pokémon defending 5 gyms and receive (50 coins...total...for each day...IF you're lucky. If you don't have a big bank account to purchase coins, don't believe in spending money on such games like me or live near gyms then coins will feel like a thing of the past.  ETC; Poke Stops don't seem to cash out as much since the gym overhaul. Would be nice to receive rare candies from poke stops also but I guess that’s why there’re called “rare” 
I’m unable to use my modules at any of the Pokémon Stops. I love this game play everyday 
This game has probably been the best game I have ever played.It makes you get up and move around then just sit down on your game boy and play some other Pokémon game. Now one down side is that WE ALL have been waiting for trading.But it makes me feel better that I know that trading will come out eventually.
Listen hear Pokémon creators, I miss the old daya of Pokémon go. I use to play on the way to school or on trips but now it’s hard to do that. Going to a gym and fighting requires you to be near the gym at all times and raid battles require that too (and I want my Pokémon that I used my raid passes for. The point I’m trying to say is that Pokémon go is starting to make it for players to go outside and walk but somethings we are welded to things we need to do like school or work. PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD POKÉMON GO WAYS. ~ :3 
Love the new Pokemon. Maybe trading Pokémon’s can be an idea with another special tool like the Pokémon watch. I Love the game a few glitches like egg hatching takes a long time to hatch.  Also make the legendary Pokémon appear outside the Pokémon gyms 
I uninstalled the game once because I was too upset with game crashing. So does my boyfriend. He couldn't install it back because his Android phone bought last year is really too slow for the game.    And the GPS location in this game is less and less stable, never enough for me to join a Raid fighting anymore. I thought it's my phone's problem. BUT, that doesn't happen on my map apps, which I can't really understand. 
Hi, I live in a small Florida town called Lorida.  And I was wondering if you could put more gyms and stops in are little town? I don't wish to be rude, but it's really hard for us gamers out here to keep up with the larger cities. So if it's not too much trouble, I'll really be appreciated!! Thank you
I love this game cuz I asked for a good Pokémon evolution and I got one thank you guys👌🏿👍🏿
Original review: The developers are so immature  The app has quite a few bugs but the most irritating one was the three step bug which now they've got ride of completely which makes it even harder to find pokemon but not only that the developers also made a couple of sites shut down because they were helping players find pokemon by showing them on a map like pokevision which made the game playable and more fun. But I guess the developers got mad because they cant fix there own bugs and hate people finding workarounds to there problems. If they had fixed the three step bug instead of getting ride of it I would have given this app a higher rating.  Edit:  WOW they updated the game... but wait they just added more features nobody really cared for and the game is still broken because they rather add more stuff then fix what’s not working. One main feature I really wish they already added is the ability to trade and battle Pokémon with your friends then maybe I would give them some slack but frankly they don’t seem to really care about there users and just want to make money off a broken game until it dies out. Hopefully Nintendo will finally decide to take this app away from niantic and get there developers to make a real app. 
The evolution animation doesn't show when you want to evolve a Pokémon.
Put all of the legendarys in at the same time I can only find kyogre in a raid and the towns in my county exempt for the one city add up to maybe 4000 people so we don’t have enough good players rural people matter too!!! otherwise, I love the game!
Hey guys cool game
Ok my friend loves Pokémon and he said that he would play it 24/7 if you added trading and also it would be cool if you added other players and see them. Also you can send friend requests and play with them.
After update the game becomes non responsive.
Pretty great game! Very addicting , but think you should add in the trade feature😉
Hey kids! Want to play a game that rewards you for doing nothing and punishes you if you’re a regular player who supports the game? Look no further than Pokémon Go!   Did you ever want to play a game about collecting creatures where (at least) one of them is locked behind a pseudo random weekly wall that can only be surpassed with a method that the developer will never tell you about, lie about later and then change up for no reason? Pokémon Go!  Do you want to spend hours and hours to unlock cosmetic content that you still have to then pay for? Man oh man, Pokémon Go is the game for you!  Thanks for crushing the spirit of your playerbase on a weekly basis, Niantic! 
Would it be possible for you to add the incubators as part of the drops when going to poke stops? it would help those who can’t afford to make the micro transactions for it. maybe as a reward for a 7 day streak or team bonus.  Also, with the EX Raid passes, can you make it so that it’s guaranteed a drop whenever anyone participates in a raid within the week? I personally don’t think it’s fair for people who get a lucky drop and do just one raid as compared to someone who raids constantly almost everyday. I have been raiding for a while now and it’s quite discouraging to see people who hardly play the game land a pass. 
This game is horrible! It started out fine but then it started to go downhill now Pokemon barely appear around this area and when I try to catch a Pokemon the game crashes and my phone freezes for like, 15 minutes this issue completely ruins the whole concept of the game because now all I can do is look at the Pokemon I already have plus I can't even go the gyms because 2 minutes within entering a gym to battle the game crashes if this isn't resolved then I will get rid of the game on all my devices and rescind all purchases and I have spent $173.29 on this game and that money was wasted
I had an idea that when a Pokémon type is boosted by the weather if your buddy matches that type that the original amount of kilometers could be half as much to get a candy
Need to have more players; I live in a fairly populated area outside of Chicago. And, there’s still not enough players to help with Raid battles. Not to mention, they are timed.  It’s tough finding certain Pokémon you want also.   Walking isn’t that accurate.   Eggs take forever to hatch, and when they do, there’s a chance you hatch something useless like a pidgey.  Music is boring; would love to hear classic Pokémon music! 
Still no pvp or trading and two years in wtfffff
I am eight years old (posting via Dad) and I have been playing Pokémon GO since late April 2017. I think it's awesome! I'm on level 29 currently and part of Team Instinct. I like the gym battles most of all. I'm also enjoying traveling more since I started playing. I'd like to share some suggestions with Niantic.   In about 5 years you might want to replace or supplement the game with a new app that is more similar to the Pokémon anime. First, you should be able to mark a location as home, and it'll automatically find out what your nearest gym is. Then, like in the anime, you should be able to have only six Pokémon at a time. CP should be removed. Appraisal should be removed too. Pokémon can't be assigned at gyms. A gym will belong to a trainer if (S)he is the last one to win a battle there. When a gym battle is going on, the player to which the gym belongs will be able to see the battle. The trainer should be seen on the battle field in gym battles and should be seen throwing out a pokeball, there will be a screen to choose which Pokémon you want to use, and it'll be the same thing for the player to which the gym belongs to. Buddy Pokémon feature should be removed. Pokestops should be removed.   The current shop could be removed and replaced with pokeshops which will be at places where pokestops currently are. At pokeshops you will be able to get all the items you can currently get at pokestops except for potions and revives. You can get potions and revives from pokecenters which will be in places like gyms and pokestops. Raid battles should be removed. Pokemon candy should be removed and stardust should be removed. Pokemon will automatically evolve at random and you won't need to evolve them unless you need evolution stones to evolve them in the Pokémon anime. The current evolution items should be removed. You can only have six of each type of pokeball. Incenses and lure modules should be removed and lucky eggs should be removed. If you're near a water area, there should be places called "Pokémon fishing spots" so you can fish for Pokémon there. After every 50 gym battles you win, at the next nearest gym, you will have a battle between you and the person the gym belongs to. This will be called a Pokémon league. You can get evolution stones from winning Pokemon leagues. If you get an evolution stone then you have an option to evolve your Pokémon.   Other features which are in Pokémon Go and not in the anime can be removed. 
Still waiting on an update where Go plus is able to work for iPhones
I am an vid pokemon go player. (4th highest level in my community of ~45 players, and I have gold gym badges on all of the EX eligible gyms around my town, as well as having a silver legendary medal and raiding 4-6 legends from Friday to Sunday weekly, but my local area has yet to get a single mewtwo. There should not be people with dozens while my county hasn’t seen a single one.
WARNING! Don’t switch your phone because you will lose your progress.
Maybe for evolved Pokémon, adding an extra candy per transfer for each evolution? Example; Pichu=1; Pikachu=2; Riachu=3? Just so you get more out of it for giving up “higher” Pokémon.
I’m sorry but there is no way you can defeat a raid boss within the time that you give us I’m sorry but we need more time to defeat the raid boss there’s no way that you can beat it with a minute and a half and expect to win are you freaking kidding me this is a bunch of crap and we deserve more freaking  time to defeat a freaking level four raid boss
The game always crashes or freezes and when I want a Pokémon it comes on then disappears.  quickly I thought with the game being around for so long that at least a crash is would have been fixed.
If they change how the Ex system works I will easily changed my 3 stat into a 5 stat! Fix the fraud system that rewards less active players! It’s sad, more you play less likely you are getting a EX pass! Which EX pass is the greatest thing to have in the game!!! FIX IT!
I’ve complained about this multiple times. An update was made but it still isn’t right. If I’m not using the functionality correctly, please let me know. When I sort by Combat Power (CP), it sorts perfectly. The Pokémon with the largest number is presented first and the rest in descending order. When I sort by Health Power (HP), it does not work. The Pokémon with the highest HP is not presented first. This is problematic because when I place Pokémon at a gym, I go by HP not CP as I’m thinking about their ability to last in a fight. Can someone fix this or let me know if I’m not correct in my understanding. Thank you! 
You say there are new Pokémon to go out and catch. Hmm... still getting same old types here. I’m really tired of the rats, birds, spiders and crabs. Are you only releasing them in certain areas???  This game has so much potential that isn’t being utilized. Seriously thinking of just deleting app.
I think you should be  able to see players when they are playing to make things such as trading, pvp ,2v2 and so on. You should make more gyms because where I live there aren’t a lot. You should add a feature where you can train your Pokémon by fighting your own Pokémon. If you want to get ratings back up I suggest you do these things. FOR ME AND FOR THE PLAYERS!!!!
Add trading and it would be the perfect game.
This game is amazing! I love that there is now different regions and more Pokémon!! One request though, make it so that you can change hairstyles, but I love everything else!
Love this game & all but it’s very difficult to heal my Pokémon. I rarely get any good potions or revives so I just have a bunch of dead Pokémon. Pokecenters would be a great add on & a useful place to heal our Pokémon. Right now it is very irritating being unable to use my strong Pokémon for battles or for gym leaders 😡 please add Pokecenters to the game.
Twice now, spawns that appear are NEVER THERE when I arrive at the location despite the radar saying it was. It’s been reported both times and NO ATTEMPTS TO FIX IT!! Im very unhappy and will not give them any more money. Con-artists!
Pokémon go? More like Pokémon no!!!!!
I started playing right when the game came out in 2016 i did leave for a while and i came back and i love the new updates still wish they make it so you can see other players so you can battle them 1v1 instead of gym or raids
Hey guys I love your app but I guess either due to my area or weather or due to provider issues; for some reason when I log in it will load me at a location but when I travel it will not move my character anywhere it just keep me at the place of loading up the game... I can still catch Pokémon but also keeps reloading the area (I.e. Pokemon popping up then disappearing...) please help I wanna get back to playing ASAP
Every since they did the big change to gyms and raids, etc. The game is setup to try and force people to buy stuff.  The change to how you collect coins from gyms is ridiculous.  They limit you to 50 coins a day no matter how my pokemon you out in gyms, which is lame.  Also, the rate at which your pokemon lose health in gyms is dumb.  It makes them too weak to fast.  Even if you try to feed them, the fruits give them almost no health.
Ok Niantic I am going to give it to you straight. You NEED to get rid of ex raids. Ex raids are the whole reason your game is dying. This review is for you and I have a system to fix your broken ex raid system.   What you need to do is once a user hits level 35-40 (somewhere between those #’s would be great) a pop up will say “you are eligible for an ex raid. Schedule one now!” Then there would be a button that says “schedule an ex raid.” After that you would walk to an eligible gym (sponsored gyms and parks) and schedule an ex raid at that gym. After you schedule the raid you will be given your ex raid pass and an invite telling you when and where you scheduled the invite. If you don’t catch mewtwo the first time you can get another chance and this process would repeat every time until you catch mewtwo. After you catch mewtwo you would be ineligible for another invite.  The current system is extremely flawed and this could fix it and bring life back into this game (of course when was the last time Niantic listened to anyone. You’re  the reason this game is dead and soon, someone is going to come along and bury you.)  I hope you listen to your community for once. 
Plz add teading
Why is team changing not allowed? I would actually play this game if I could play with my fiends without starting over. I would have also never stopped playing this game. Bad form.
🤣😂😅😍😘😆😁😄😃😀😋😛😝😜🤪 so much fun!
This games I amaze
I just lost over 40 combinations of poke balls, master balls, hyper balls, and berries, only to have five Pokémon escape and run away from me. This is ridiculous. A ton of them were aimed well. It’s not right that players lose that many items only to have the Pokémon escape and run away. This is why more and more people are spending less time on the game!
It is hard to find pokestops near by so therefore resources run out easily. Also there must be some sort of bug because I had 20 poke balls to go on later to it saying I had 0
Worst game ever👿😡
Dear Niantic I love the game and still play it today but could you start cycling legendary raids so those who failed or never got to get a specific legendary also could you release mewtwo and mythicals to to the public please do this thank you
I LOVE THUS GAME and I would like it if they updated older phones like the iPhone 5s more often to update.
this is my first day playing and on the privatcy and policey thing there’s no apcet or decline SO HELP MEEEEE also update already at 2018
Regularly people park in my yard because of this game.  Across the street is a place where Pokémon characters frequently show up.  And careless millennials then think my grass is a parking lot.  Frustrating.
I got an update last week and now I have to get another one.
You need to add Pokémon from Pokémon sun and moon
Game not functioning currently, can’t even get it to open :/ Was great till this.
I live in Wayzata MN. And I have to drive a mile away to the nearest poké stop.
When to catch a legendary said I caught it, then I received a “Network Error”?????? Now it shows I didn’t in my Pokédex????
I got this so my son and I could play together due to his huge love of Pokémon. In the beginning it was great. But over the past couple years, you can tell that Niantic only cares about the money. It isn’t player friendly. Unless you live in a gigantic city, or are willing to travel to one, you will never find anything other than the Pokémon you can find anywhere. Also, the lack of caring by Niantic is disgusting. Spoofers are overtaking all the gyms in a town and no matter how many times they are reported, nothing is done about it. I’m done.
I love this game but I wish you could have friends, put accessories on your Pokémon, gift pokemon, and trade Pokémon. Please add it in the next update.
I am locked out because i don’t have my player ID. This is very frustrating
Glitch. Every time I try to evolve a critter it just takes the candy and crashes. No points credited for XP.  Cheated! Won’t let me put in a review either! lol. Thanks  Update:   Still taking my candy when I try to evolve them. Then freezes up when I try to transfer to the professor. HELLO? 
The bugs that are not being fixed are getting really old. Every update they say “optimizations and bug fixes” but in reality  there is no bug fix going on.   • Pokemon still randomly disappear for minutes at a time • screen still has seizures after exiting gyms • unresponsive screen at frequent times • gym battle animations improvements please • instant kill from raid boss charge moves after dodging them • swapping pokemon in-battle is a pain and often doesn’t work • viewing gym member’s Pokémon is difficult and occasionally results in extreme display errors.  • CONNECTION is garbage! It’s so bad I’m going to get mad just writing about it so I’ll just leave it at that.  Besides bugs though here are my content ideas:  • Along with transferring add the option to “release”. This option will not grant candy like transferring but instead released pokemon return the ball they were caught with. This will help rural players on drastic levels!! • faster “Gotcha” and successful catch process • New Music throughout game • Friends! Must be within trainer radius to add. I will mention the benefits below. • In Game Map! This will be available as top view map of 5km around you. It will show the location of friends (or last location with a time stamp) that have been added as well as Gym and Pokestop locations. • Add a Mail System! Like in the main series games you can send mail to friends. This will act as a limited chat system. You can only communicate with friends. The animation could will show a bird pokemon flying away with an envelope. • Eggs are very difficult to hatch at a reasonable pace for average players. I do not have the time nor battery life to walk 5k 9 times over. It takes me 1 week per 5km egg. This is because I live where it snows, is windy, and it drains your battery life, so it’s very difficult. Driving to get egg distance should not be expected or hinted towards, mostly because it takes gas$.  All I would like is a faster rotation of eggs in my inventory.  •  Raid Battle BUG still active. Raid boss charge moves auto KO occasionally still even when doves with minimal damage. • Raid Battle attack animations for all pokemon need work.  • CP rework please. Vaporeon, Slaking, Blastoise, Meganium, etc. are all out of place and a balancing is overdue • Starter Pokémon has 100% IVs and first catch awards 15 candies instead of initial 3. (Just makes the First encounter more special.) • Pokestops award items in correlation to how far away the next closet pokestop is. If a Pokestop is 1 km away from the next closest one then it will give around 4-6 items; if there are several in a close distance, about .2 km, then they will award 2-3 items. Any more than 3 km away awards 6-8. • CPU Trainers you can battle on the map • Oh, and PVP and Trading 
Hello trainers! Later on you will get more pokemon like altaria swan
After most recent update it just does not work on my phone. Unplayable
Ok, this is insane. It’s 45 degrees and dry out and I got a warning about weather, that I had to dismiss by saying “I am safe”. Then there’s a weather pop-up behind it. Are you guys high? See request #2  1) FIXED! - Game loads insanely slow. I have an iPhone X and it takes longer than any game on my phone to load. ~15-20s average. Sometimes longer.   2) 3 times I need to dismiss terms of conditions, tell you “I’m safe” and then that I accept the completely inaccurate and ridiculous weather conditions. I have a weather app and my 5 senses to tell me of weather issues. I don’t need a “game” to tell me and force me to click an extra button to dismiss its intrusive message.  3) Battery drain with minimal use is pretty bad. Maybe offer a stationary mode, where people can manage their Pokémon inventory, etc. while not using GPS? Even adding a way to do this on my computer would be helpful.   4) “Appraising” Pokemon to determine their stats or “IV” is painful. Can you share out some additional Pokémon details on the main page, or even when clicking them individually?  5) FIXED! - When transferring to the professor, it automatically scrolls up to the top of your Pokémon list. Can it stay where it was on the page, similar to when you “appraise” a Pokémon?   6) Can you snap to grid on the Pokémon page? You have to be delicate when scrolling between favorites, Pokémon and egg pages, to not end up on the far right/left.  7) Can you implement a way to sort by which Pokémon are currently defending a gym? I don’t always use top CP Pokémon and it would be nice to sort in this fashion. 
Whatever
Servers go town app starts to glitch now I’ve lost like 120 some great balls and like 200 poke balls! Not happy about that
Fix the network errors I can’t play the game witch is making me upset I have an iPhone 7 Plus. I can’t catch pokemon or get stops
Empece a jugar pokemon go cuando salió. Lo borre porque me aburrió. Lo volví a bajar por la nueva generación pero ya muy pronto me aburrió. El juego se cae muy seguido.  Los gimnasios no siempre puedes entrar sale error o te dice que estas muy lejos y te saca del gym aunque ya hayas entrado. Los pokemon salen los mismos todo el tiempo o no sale nada. Creo que la compañía no contó con que la gente trabaja y tiene vida y no pueden andar por el mundo caminando. Lo único que salva el juego es que son pokemon si quitas los pokemon y pones otros animales el juego no tendría nada de éxito porque esta muy mal diseñado.
Fails to launch about half the time. Gets stuck on intro screen. Has gone backward in terms of stability
I was wondering who else thought Pokémon Go should have players to battle?
Pokémon go is on of the best games out there give rate 5
Really good app and very fun it more fun if your a Pokémon fan
I love the game, it’s really fun to play especially with friends. But there are some changes that need to happen. Like how Eevee evolves into a random evolution. The stones (Water Stone, Fire Stone, etc) need to be in the game like the other evolution items because right now there is a 1/5 chance on getting the eevee evolution you want. Also the weather, how can you get foggy? The probability of that happening is really low in most countries and cities. Can’t you make it something like “Full Moon” or “New Moon” which makes more sense because dark Pokémon should spawn during the dark. Well it’s not really a weather but still it’s an idea that’s better than foggy. Also there is a bug when you zoom out near a pokestop that you span it shows as if you didn’t spin it (Blue) but when you zoom in it’s purple. Thank you for your time
Awesome game I play it when ever I can but the loading screen (when ever I open the game) takes like 10000 try's just to play the game. I have to close the game and re-open it so many times and it's kinda frustrating. Please fix (it may be my phone TBH)
Can we get another version where it’s more realistic where you actually have to adventure in the woods ands only can find them by region and they are harder to find and you do mash them together, you know like classic Pokémon cause this a kinda eh
Love pikachu
My character no longer moves with me when I am playing the game. This means I can’t do the bare minimum of playing the game like adding Pokémon to gyms or catching Pokémon because I am stuck in one location. Please check and get this fixed ASAP
the pedometer works terribly, I walked 400 meters, he counted 100. disgustingly
Since about 5 pm yesterday, I’ve been getting gps errors, and have been unable to play the game. Is there an update going on or something? I’ve tried everything in my settings and even reinstalled the app, rebooted my phone, and it’s still not working
Do u kno de wae?  I think u kno de wae But I du not kno de wae 
Same issues that have plagued pokemon go from its birth are still relevant, Support team is a joke and doesnt actually exist its automated responses, app constantly crashes or locks up, raid battles still only work when they feel like it, daily gym coins only come back when the game feels like giving them out,  and gym battles are less reliable than raid battles. New stuff added but the old stuff still doesn't work correctly
I love the game I love how you have the categorized. But I think it would be easier so you can organize by the candies closest to evolving. I’m constantly looking through my Pokémon trying to see which is closest to evolving... if you can try it out to see how it could work out that would be awesome
iPhone 6 iOS 11.2.2 app fails to load. Need to force close and restart multiple times to load. Otherwise great app
a great idea turn to a piece of shirt，this game has nothing like the original Pokemon except they have a lot of money and able to use the same characters，seriously nothing to “play” but a wast of time
My friend and I actively play this game and are in competition with each other for the best and most pokedex entries. Generation 3’s drop has really helped me because my small town went from one spawn and nothing else to three spawns, a gym, and a stop. Keep at it Niantic!!
Good job on adding the other gens, but ! As stated on comments it’s just too hard & not enough players to do raids and upon that the game is just too hard it almost feels like a job ... those poke stops are very Dry only giving me a poke all or two with almost infinite Pokémon’s to capture . The game should be where we can control our avatar to explore , not the excessive walking & the unfair ratio for candies & amount of poke balls... I hope you guys get it together I’ll be swinging by occasionally to check the game for any of these improvements but meanwhile as a disappointed fan I’ll be uninstalling Pokémon go yet again.  P.S: trading , pvp, maybe even a quest and story with avatar exploration wouldn’t be a bad idea , the game is too vague & I can feel that money is something you guys are trying to make . 
I really like this game but it would be better if when u go to catch a Pokémon u gotta battle it first like they be doing on tv and once u win u get to catch it 👍🏽
The game should be more of catching Pokémon and battling your friends, or other ai trainers that you’ll come by, that would be so much more fun.  And the map thing where Pokémon just pop up. I really hope that was a joke. 
This game is horrendous. The real Pokémon fans won't even touch this. Never heard of a Pokémon game where you have to rely on other people to catch good Pokémon for yourself. News flash no one plays this game anymore. Raids are impossible. Revives and potions are unheard of in this game making it utterly unplayable. I've recently re downloaded this game thinking it might be fun again but I was wildly disappointed. 0 of ten save yourself the stress. This game is still trash. Not fun at all rip Pokémon go
My pokemon has been stuck at a gym for almost a month now. This is a recurring issue. Is there a solution coming anytime soon??? 5 stars once that is fixed, love this game!!
I made 2 purchases was given the things I bought now I cannot download anything from my App Store because Pokémon go is saying that I did not pay for my items. The payment was taken from bank account so how do I owe money? Can someone please get Jon touch with me
It won’t let me be in the game because of the training club
When I first tried to play it my character was stuck and there was two Pokémon inside each other and I couldn’t throw any poki ballls  I think my games glitched or something but idk if it can get fixed that would be awesome
Is it me or do Low cp pokemon seam tougher to catch? Like cp 90-200 just pop out poke balls... The weather feature is adorable though
Most recent edit: Suggestion for how raid battles could work in the future: A new gym feature where you can log a time you can come and if nobody else logs that they're coming you cancel it and leave. Trying to organize for raids right now is still super frustrating and basically useless unless you’re in the middle of a city.   Please lower the buddy candy distance, I've said this in like every review I've left. If you're unable to spend all the time in your day playing, you're basically never going to get those candies you need. Maybe in like five years. Second, please change the hp sorting to sorting by the actual number of hp a pokémon has and not sorting by damage like it currently does. Having it sort that way is useless, you could just click on a potion if you needed to see who was hurt. Plus they're on the bottom anyways so doubly useless. Third please make it easier to connect with others players for a raid battle. Having to resort to outside groups like Facebook is annoying. And half the time it's just impossible to fight a raid period. You see one, you go to it, there's no there but you, and it's too strong so you either sit there and wait for an hour or more or you leave the rare pokémon you need behind. Two not great options. Please implement some sort of solution for this, I'm sick of letting awesome pokémon go because I'm the only one there to fight it. Fourth, the pokecoins. A 50 day limit is kind of ridiculous and if I have a pokémon in a gym, every hour it stays in past the 50 coins is just a waste. There's no reason for it to be in the gym if it's already reached its max coin limit. Plus if two or more pokémon come back on the same day? You just lose any coins you could have gotten past 50. Super infuriating when you feel like you should be earning so much more. I get you want people to buy coins instead of earning them so there has to be a limit, but this is just bad. And lastly, the battery issue. I know this has already been addressed but please do something sooner than later because this app is DRAINING my battery. I open it and my phone instantly drops 2% or more. Thank you! 
The character position on the screen keeps stopping when I am riding in a car or walking. Quite often it will not move again until the game is switched away from and then brought back onto the screen. Then the character dashes around very quickly to the current position, quite often triggering the “you are moving too fast” warning. Once in that position keep walking or riding and the character sits there until you switch away and back from the game again. Restarting the game did not correct this. Restarting the phone did not correct this. Prior to this last release these problems were not occurring though the last two releases have definitely seen a reduction in the quality of GPS tracking compared to earlier.  I had to switch away from in return to the game occasionally even close it and restart to get the character to move to the gym I was standing right in the middle of.  Some of the new features are nice; weather affects, the different Pokémon and rewards, but basic functionality is suffering. 
I have put an insane amount of time into this game. I’m convinced there are too many players with GPS spoofing. No one is at the physical location but the raid battles are full. Makes no sense. Too hard to level up when Niantic’s data is garbage and ends up catering to spoofers. Garbage in, garbage out.
Gyul I like this ting bad. It ova sweet like ovadweet.
I love this game but I can’t sign in with my email and I don’t have a pokemon club email so can u fix that?
When are you guys going to us battle Pokémon's in the Wild it will make the game more interesting to play battling Pokémon's in the wild with your body will be great just like the GameBoy games back in the old days
Overall love the game but I think you should add some communication box in the gyms that way we can message people who come to the gym so we can find other people to play Pokémon Go with! That way we have better chance of getting more of the really high legendary Pokémon! 😇😇
1/31/2018: Overall I’ve stayed hooked since the beginning. It’s fun and challenging to play, and very rewarding when you meet a goal. I’d like to see Skarmory and Aerodactyl taken out of 10ks.  10/2017:  Please take Gligars and Mareeps out of 10ks. I've hatched at least 3 of each, as has my girlfriend, and it's very disappointing. Please add more space in our backpack given there's so many new items. Needs some work on glitches. It'd be nice to see raids further away. Overall it's a fun game. 
Make a soulrock spun at 20300 lubarway brokville md 20833 please Olney this once!!!!!!!
I work during the day until atleast 5pm most days.... I like battling in the raids but majority of them in my area are ALL during the day between 7am to 1pm. Is there any way to add more during the evenings between 5-10pm? Most of my friends who play are at work during those times and I also have children that play and they are in school. Isn’t much fun when you can see them pop up on the game but can’t actually go battle for the Pokémon!!!
Was trying to catch Pokémon and when I walk to go find it the character doesn't walk with me he just stands around even when driving around slowly the character does not move
was cool for a week
And gym battles are messed up now too why can’t I train my Pokémon? I want to fight Pokémon as much as possible but raids are either to hard to solo or just to easy I WANT TO FIGHT MONSTERS and it’s hard to get people to actually raid with me please address this niantic
I need a way to buy 6 friends for the legendary raids.  There are not enough people raiding when I can. There is a group  of snobs that just raid at 5:30 who won’t wait for me.  They made me feel bad. It isn’t fun when I can’t be succcessful on my own in a game. Please send some legendary Pokémon that I can catch.
Can’t login to account! Niantics poor customer support was no help!!
Game continues to kick me out and not let me log back in saying my password is incorrect. It’s pathetic because I also try to reset my password and it also says my player ID is incorrect. I’m not playing anymore until there is a new update that won’t do this...
It’s saying I put in my information wrong when I have not 100%!!  This has happens once before and I had to completely start over.  I will not do it again! 
I love the game so much but some things get cut off sometimes on my iPad Pro. Like the loading screen, and sometimes pokeballs. Also it may not be the game but the gps don’t work that well. I run the tablet off mobile hotspot from my phone
I totally love this game and play it almost every day and now that they fixed a glitch it’s awesome probably my favorite game!!! I also think it’s cool that they keep adding new Pokémon which is why this is an awesome amazing game but if they stopped this game would get really boring. Also I think it would be really cool if you could add a Valentine’s Day pikachu or maybe you could add something cool to a luvdisc. This is an amazing game.   P.S. I would love it if you could add trading because it would make the game even better. 
The app is amazing and really fun to play, but the menus on the iPad are insanely zoomed in, and display sometimes less info than a phone would.
In the most recent update, the bug Niantic is ignoring that I find most irritating is: Once you have selected a type of Pokéball to throw, that selection sticks even after you have stopped engaging with the Pokémon— so when you go to catch that Weedle after throwing Ultra balls at something more valuable, make sure that you stop and change your ball selection back to the appropriate level before accidentally chucking a rarer Pokéball.
It's a fun game, but what's stupid is you need a mode of transportation plenty of pokestops around or you need to be wealthy enough to travel to regionals, and wealthy to buy balls and everything, also you always need like 16 friends otherwise legendary are out of the question, so unless you don't mind the bull get the game and walk around for the same 10 Pokémon that spawn everywhere
Giving it 1 Star because they made it impossible to capture pokémon. you must buy pokeballs bc each pokémon takes 3 or 4 every time?! very sad
I just started playing. So far, I love the game. Sometimes it lags and it takes forever to load but no big deal. But I’d like the game to be more team friendly. If you could add the capability to donate Pokeball or potions and revives to another player. To make friends and save their information in the Pokédex or something. To keep in touch with them. To trade Pokemon. To compete in little trophies to who gets the most legendaries. Add more characteristics from the actual games. More berries.   If possible to make it more team/friend based to make groups and interact with one another, but also letting one go solo if needed. 
I honestly love this game but there has been an issue lately where every thing has underscores and all my Pokémon are pikachu but I only have one and they all have the same health and cp. But besides that it’s a great and addictive game.
Why can’t we trade Pokémon, buy and sell items, battle other trainers with turned based Pokémon moves? This game is a sad excuse for a Pokémon game. It had amazing potential, but was ruined by trying to be over innovative. People wanted this game to be a real life IR Pokémon rpg, instead we got micro transactions and a battle system where you simply tap to attack over and over and over.
That’s what I have to say about PoGo
I love this game but please put more revives in the pokestops.
The game is perfect, but, might I suggest something, the ability to battle other trainers.
Is it my imagination, or did night get lighter? It looks like Day now. It used to have more blue in it.  It’s 9pm and looks the exact same at 3am, but it looks like they changed the colors.  Sorry, I liked the blue. :-( I’m also seeing a lot of the first generation again and very few others.
I live in Jamaica and literally no adult or anyone who can drive has this game and if you walk outside in Jamaica, you have a 89% of living not lying.
Wanna explain to me why you randomly log me off and when I put in my correct log in info you take me back to the sign in screen like nothing happened? Let me play the game!!!
So the new weather conditions is a great idea, and I love it. The one HUGE issue I have with it is this, it claims certain conditions have certain Pokémon types appear \"more frequently\" which they do, for the most part. My issue is when it\'s windy out, it claims that dragon types will appear as well and I have yet to see a single dragon type, and I live in an area where the conditions are usually always windy, and believe me I have spent HOURS driving around hoping to find even a single Dratini, let alone any dragon type, still nothing. This also applies to \"electric type\" appearing more when it rains, I\'ve had the same issue with the electric type appearing just as I did with the dragon type. I have not seen a single electric type when we had about a week of rain. I understand that having Dratini\'s spawning like crazy would mean it would be extremely easy to get a Dragonite, but at least give us a few. I have been playing since this game was created and I have only gotten one Dratini from an egg. This is literally my only issue with this game, if you guys can actually make some dragon types appear when it\'s windy like it \"claims\" it does, then this game would be flawless. Until then, I\'m keeping this at a 2 star rating until I actually see a dragon type when it\'s windy.
Near quintessential app to judge your Pokémon in Pokémon Go!
We are three generations in; so that should mean three master-balls by now. Can we get the MASTERBALL please? What if we see that Perfect mewtwo or Dragonite? --- Thanks again! ---
Why do we have to sign in to the Pokémon club when it doesn’t work. I downloaded the app 12 times now and it still doesn’t work
Seriously!? You can’t make all gyms EX viable? Rural players can barely play the the game and now we’re being punished for not having a Starbucks or Sprint store? I’m so sick of this game selecting random new players and spoofers for EX passes while loyal players get nothing. This game isn’t worth playing.
I have over 800 raids completed and never gotten an ex pass, im raiding at 12 sponsored locations a week all gyms that get ex raids every other week and I have silver badges for those gyms even some are gold. I’m filling all of the criteria that they said would increase my chance. In my local group the same players keep getting passing every week and I’m doing the same raids as them. Not to mention this system is abused by spoofers and multi accounters and that doesn’t help my problem. The algorithm for this system is completely unfair. I should not have to hear about somebody getting their 11th ex raid pass when they have only done 200 raids total, when I’m sitting here for 6 months completing over 600 raids without getting a single pass. I’ve reached out to customer support and get nothing back they have close to no support whatsoever for their player base and clearly don’t care that this abused, corrupt, and broken system is effecting their most dedicated players in a extremely negative way.
I love this game. It’s a great concept, especially the way it gets people to be active. Obviously there would be things that could be changed, i.e. more customization and better support to players in rural areas, but overall the game is a lot better than when it first launched. There’s just a few factors missing from the game as a whole, and it’s a big part of the Pokémon franchise... First, actually BATTLING the Pokémon one-on-one! Gyms and raids are not enough in this respect, and I’d be willing to let go of the battling when catching Pokémon as long as I can still battle my friends when I see them! On that note, the other thing is player interaction! Gifting items, trading Pokémon, and like I said, battling friends! I have no access to gyms or Pokéstops where I live, and since I cannot drive a car yet to get to them, I will lose my streaks because I run out of pokéballs and physically cannot catch Pokémon! Coins from gym battles would help, but I’ve never gotten coins yet because I have no access to gyms! If I could battle friends and other players in general for coins, that would help my poke ball problem so much! I’d also be able to level up easier. In the games, I’m great at Pokémon, but here, my mom got a higher level me even though she downloaded the games WEEKS after I did, just because she can catch Pokémon while having lunch at work. I cannot reach any of these without having to walk down the highway for an hour just for one stop. So basically: player interaction and rewards from it! I’m not paying money for a “free-to-play” app.
Ever since your last update now when you catch Pokémon the ball doesn’t change back to the red and white ball so you end up accidentally using a great ball or ultra ball if you don’t pay close attention and change it back yourself. It was so much easier when the ball would just go back to the red and white one. Fix this and my stars will go back up
I love this game I'm addicted to it I would love to be able to fight and chose a attack against other Pokemon it would be nice if we could weak them out than catch them   I’ve been having and issue with Pokémon gyms sometimes I would leave Pokémon’s on gyms but all I get is your Pokémon fought hard but no pokecoins that’s kind of bad since there aren’t that many gyms around my area makes me feel like it’s not worth it to leave my Pokémon in a gym if I’m not getting anything just wasting my revivals and potions 
This game was great. I loved it. I love that they are adding so many new Pokémon’s. But it’s limiting those of us who live in smaller towns and who don’t have a ton of friends or hate socializing with people we don’t know. The raids should be doable solo or with small groups, even if you have to exit and come back 10 times. They could even add a boost you pay real money for, to make you stronger; or maybe add artificial players to help fight. Like those from the real game. It should hold your progress for up to 30 minutes. Then you heal, come back in, and continue where you left off. And even if they don’t do this, make them in the wild then. And I really hate that the female clothes are so ugly and limited, but the male clothes are awesome! WTH?
I first downloaded Pokémon go when it first came out and I still play it in 2018. Pokémon go is awesome and I highly recommend it.The new updates it has been adding have made the game even better and this is one game I will never delete.
I’ve tried 7 different times to register my 10 yo to play on the app, and Niantic’s security policies have made it absolutely impossible for me to register my child. Instead of allowing g me to add a child to my existing account, I have to create a new account and add the child, which is impossible. Passwords meet all of the security requirements and still will not create the child account. If I have to do Captcha one more time I’m going to scream. I’ve given up and we will not be playing this stupid game anymore.
I live a rural area. our downtown is filled with pokestops. it would be nice to see more stops and gyms through out the county, like the county park.
Whenever I try to evolve my Pokémon, it does not go to the screen of the whole process. It stays on the not-evolved Pokémon and then says network error. By going out of my Pokémon list and going back to recent, there the evolved Pokémon is. I did not have this problem before this past update, so please fix!
Pretty disappointed the Evolve feature does not work. It takes time to get the candy needed to evolve Pokemon and then it’s gone and you have no evolved Pokemon. It was apparently fixed but now not working once again.
The rate of potions and more importantly revives dropped from Pokestops was dropped as opposed to removing them from raid rewards all together. This makes it impossible to do raids. Please fix this issue immediately, balance out what drops from Pokestops and remove potions and revives from the raid rewards all together.
I really really loooove this app.  It started me into loving pokemon! But recently my pokemon avatar is not moving when I am! It’s really unusual because my brother also plays and it works just fine. I love going on walks. And without pokemon go, I don’t really have anywhere to go.  Sometimes I would have to exit out the app, and pull it back up so it would reload to where I am. And sometimes even that doesn’t work.  I now have only 5 pokeballs  because pokemon go is failing to notice I  am moving.   Another problem is that a gym near me has disappeared. I was really confused because it was closer then the other gym.  I thought I might have been the school teachers complaining about the kids playing Pokémon on school grounds and had it removed...  And finally some good feed back!   I absolutely have loved this app since I got it back in 2016, and loved seeing all the new pokemon come! I really love how when I took my trip to Rome, Italy, there was awesome pokemon that I could find!  (Also in Italy I got my favorite pokemon, Vulpix!!)  And now I’m into collecting Vulpix cards.... Oh dear... haha! I’m a pokenerd! 
As someone who played Pokemon as a child, I enjoyed this game, but I felt like it didn't capture what Pokemon really is. Pokemon doesn't consist of simply walking around catching monsters but training them and fighting with them too! The training system in this game is awful and needs to be changed to the way it is in the actual Pokemon games. By adding battles with wild Pokemon in the game, you should be able to train up your Pokemon earning new levels which earns new moves. The game also needs to replace the crappy CP system with levels and HP like in the actual Pokemon game.  I like the idea of the PokeStops; they're creative and force the player not to just stay in one spot, but they should also include the PokeMarts and the healing capabilities of PokeCenters.  Pokemon has two types of players: the ones who roam around attempting to catch all of the Pokemon and the ones who battle and attempt to level up Pokemon becoming as strong as they can. This game is fantastic for the first type of player but it is complete trash for the second type. Fixing the battle system mainly and allowing Pokemon to level up by battles instead of using cannibalism would make the game way better.  Please fix this. 
Great app, love it! All I ask is for there to be regular packages for raid passes, not just during special sales. I love raiding and would like to buy them in bulk.
Played the game since launch have grown to hate it because it has become a giant cash grab. Even low level Pokémon are almost impossible to catch without 4-5 balls. Poor weather conditions during the winter make it impossible to play unless in an urban setting. Oh and legendary Pokémon are not obtainable unless you have a large group of friends and can meet up at the some time. Very poor entry for such a great line of games.
You know, this game is fun and all but seriously up the catch rate PLEASE FOR GOD SAKE I recently won a Kyogre raid and I didn’t even get it with my 11 balls so what the heck
The app freezes right after the Niantic logo
I got a new phone the 6s and the Pokémon avatar would not move I think the iOS 11 can not hold the Pokémon go update. Pokémon go need to update their app soon because it is getting me mad and not making me play so please have an update soon to fix this.
Please make it so the game gives credit for steps taken on treadmill!
I think that you should get the same pokéball that you caught a Pokémon with, when you transfer a Pokémon. You should make a update about this and Im not saying that this is a lame or boring game it’s really fun. :)
I have been noticing that some Pokémon are bigger than others, and when their is a bunch of Pokémon I don’t see the small ones . Like today their was  a onix  it was so small I couldn’t see it in the bunch of Pokémon their were . But it is a pretty good game . I play every day .
Soooooo....for the second time in 18 months I cannot access my account.  The first time my account was frozen (AFTER REACHING LEVEL 31) and had to set up another account.  NOW my new account will not allow access (AFTER REACHING LEVEL 35)...if this is the way you clowns handle your product rest assured...I WILL BE SURE TO MAKE PEOPLE AWARE THAT THIS GAME IS A SCAM FOR NIANTIC TO MAKE MONEY!!!  In my line of work I influence a multitude of millennials (and others) in regards to gaming.
I haven’t been able to log in for three days. The game won’t let me play.
Aside from having to grind to get anywhere, no pvp, no trading, and safari zone style catching (minus the rocks) it isn’t too bad for a free game. Raids are pretty decent. I live in a college town. I’d love to see the rest of gen 2 pokemon. I wish you could get more than one raid pass a day without buying. During the week it’s hard to find a decent raid during my schedule and on the weekend I run out of passes. Having a little trouble getting water type starters in my area.
Is anyone else not earning candies from walking their buddy?
Feel like this caused too much problems in the world
After you get to level 15 it really only lets you get pretty much 2 out of every 25 pokestops. It’s like your out of poke balls and your parents won’t let you spend money you go to pokestops but this game just say “ sorry try again later and kicks you out of the pokestop and just makes you keep running and won’t let you get anymore pokestops
PvP, trading. Enough said.
Don’t start playing, you will only become extremely frustrated once you realize how unfair and do disrespectful The ex raid pass system is.  They even gave out passes for raids on Christmas and then actually took them away....if Niantic cared for players they would fix this.  Most players are extremely frustrated and feel they are wasting their time playing.
Because I have kyogre And I like Gen |||. But Gen | and Gen || is stupid u idiots I’m sorry because gen two and one are just boring . When I started the game I JUST GOT GARAYDOS AND DRAGONITE AND I JUST GOT A 10km 🥚and RHYDON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It’s my lucky  day! The CP was 109 GARAYDOS 990 dragonite 209 rhydon . And this what I caught In my 10km 🥚A LAPRAS THAT IS 1902!!!!!!!!  And I was 23 lvl. The time I was lvl 28 I evolved my magnite to magenton     Chapter 2 fighting raids. My first raid was Muk In Florida my 2nd raid was... fusigibana which means veanasaur 3rd moltres but I ran out of battery😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😡😡😡😡😠😠😠😡 STUPID BATTERY!!!!!!!!! 😡😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😢😢😢. Chap 3 Lvl 30 Sunday 7 : 30 today is the day to go for raids! I have to go raid when 8:00 I looked in Facebook to look at Pokémon go but then I found a club full of Pokémon trainers then I asked may I join? Then pbjpoke said yes then I said yay! Chap 4 8:00 pbjpoke said last call for krogre because he’s gonna come back to his 🏠 so we went to Bolton park to get the Kyogre. After that I GOT IT!!!!!!!!!! 😀😀😀🙂🙂🙂 So that toke so long to write It toke like 2 hours! Love pokemon
First of all it took forever to set up an account, then after trining for hours wouldn’t let me in even though I had 3 bars ( iOS) I wouldn’t waste your time
Hi I know you guys are doing amazing things with the app and other stuff. I’m kinda frustrated that the weather thing I’m in Lake Tahoe and there is snow everywhere .I feel like that if there is snow in the ground there should be ice type.  I think if it’s snowing people are going to go out and possibly hurt themselves or others thank you I hope you have a great time with the app
Id like it to be the use of the camera to find them hiding and the camera recognizes shapes in the real world and uses them. So you simulate pokemon hunting.   You should also be able to battle trainers around you or people in the real world. Rather than using candies to level up or evolve pokemon which is a chore for many. You wont find 150 charmanders to get a charizard.  The game could be amazing to poke fans that knew the pain of growing up playing with their imaginations and never getting to live in that world they loved so much 
Love the game, but getting so sick and tired of weedle, rattata & pidgey!!  You gotta slow these guys down from appearing and speed up the appearances of Gen3 Pokémon instead!
I have in the past complained about not getting the last ten km egg for the nine ten km egg challenge and now I am barely getting the ten km and and I don’t mind hatching the other eggs it’s just way harder now to get the ten km since my last complaint
It really is!!!!!!!!!!
I had this game before but I’m trying to get it again and I can’t sign in with google which is how I used to do it, how do I sign in????? Please reply!!!!!!
So you know when you are raiding, waiting maybe 150 seconds? You sit there waiting in the raid lobby and some people are on a time rush, could there be a button or so to tell the game your ready, and if everyone else presses it, the raid battle will automatically start? Overall I love this game! Its so crazy how its gets so many stay home people to move around!!😆😆 This game is really awesome I got my friends to play it!!!
This game is amazing but it has some downfalls like for people who don’t have cell service devices and the game should have mega evolution. If the Pokémon reaches a certain level or when you find a stone and a mega stone band for your wrist or necklace you should make your Pokémon mega evolve for as long as you want.

I love it! It has so many poke stops and Pokémon and many more!
It is a good game but keeps glitching out and not letting me move around the map
So I wake up this morning to play my Pokémon go and I am being forced to sign in with google so I can be tracked where I go. It give me the option yes or no and I chose no and it won’t let me continue to play with the app. This really really make me made. I allow google to follow me on some things but not every freaking thing. This is ridiculous. I ghouls be allowed to say no and continue to play.  Love the app but now I’m really considering deleting if I’m not allowed to play if I do t accept google tracking me. 
Well every time we do a raid someone gets kicked. It’s really frustrating especially when you only have a few min before the raid ends. I got kicked and wasn’t able to join and it’s really gotten to the point where it makes me want to delete the game. Once this is fixed I’ll change my rating.
I love the game but would really appreciate like a daily log in if balls because like me not everyone can get out to hit the pokestops or buy more balls. Please think about this and possibly add it in to the game.
Well, I’m homeschooled, and don’t go out often. So this immediately means that if I find that I’m running out of Pokéballs, well, I don’t catch anything, which defeats the purpose of the game. I understand the point of the game, but I live right next to a gym, and near a Pokéstop, but I’m not close enough to either to get anything! I keep running out of stuff, and can’t do anything! The only time I’m close enough to do anything is in the car, but even then, we always pass by Pokéstops too fast! I love this game, but a can’t play it! I do know it’s not targeted directly at kids, but it’s still a game that kids play. I feel like you should get a daily reward of five or so Pokéballs. Or perhaps you get 50 Pokécoins for a seven day streak. There are so many possibilities to make it easier for us kids, just take advantage of them and use them!
I like this game, but I can't play it on the go.  I use an iPad and for some reason mine doesn't have data. I can't get any poke balls because there are no pokestops around me. By the time I find one my wifi has run out and my app shuts down. If you make it so the game doesn't need wifi, I'm sure you'll get a bunch of players who keep the game installed, but for this reason I'm uninstalling the game. 
The game is cool but it could be cooler. I was hoping that we would be able to battle and train outside of gyms, more like the video games...if we could do that, this would be perfect.
The game has overall surpassed my expectations but the fact we could be trading now and becoming more social where I could meet a Pokémon player through the game would be fantastic to know.
Ok so i just hatched a 10k and got a freaking skarmory from it. like it doesn’t evolve and it’s a piece of trash so can you guys put it like a 2k and let me get a rare from a 10k because it’s a lot of work to hatch...
This is a game with a good experience, you get to play a game outside if your home get some exercise I am 60 and just love the game for me beats GT6! Love playing GT6.
This is da best mobile Pokémon game when the day the gen 3 came out I wanted a ralts and I got one yes
There is a problem in the game. The problem is that in some of the island in Maldives we can’t find a single Pokémon and also sometimes if we visit a island to play Pokémon sometimes in the island there will not be a gym also. So i hope that you guys can do something about it (if you want to check there is no Pokémon in that please check B dharavandhoo, B atoll location Maldives) hope you guys will do something about it.
I was so happy to get my new phone 📱 and get Pokémon go but to won’t set up 😢😢😤🤬🤬🤬🤭🤫
You guys should a fishing pole to the game so if you are neer  water then you can catch water Pokémon  (I mean sown water on game) 
Used to play this game more but the past few months when I open it, it only loads up about half the time and when it does there are GPS and performance issues so frequently that it’s unplayable.
I’m a veteran playing this game along with my sons, we play this game on the side as well as football, fishing, and many other things, I’m almost level 36 and my kids aren’t far behind me. As they released these recent new updates in the past year and plenty of new Pokemon, and added raids with very powerful Pokemon, also added the feature where your Pokémon is in a gym defending and over time it loses power by itself. I think this is very stupid. You work hard enough to get your Pokemon in the gym and nobody has to even fight the gym for you to lose the majority of your strength and if you have no berries, well then you die as soon as somebody comes along and notices that you’re in the black. Worst than that, why is it that the pokeballs that we get are not even from the poke-stops? You need a lot more great balls and super balls than red balls.  Anyways, that’s a huge problem, we need a lot more berries and yellow and blue balls from these poke-stops because the game is just becoming ridiculous, you can’t get anywhere.
Turkiyeye gelsin !!!
The load time on my brand new iPhone X is more than triple that of much older Android phones. The memory footprint must also be enormous given that if I try multitasking it shuts down and requires that I wait minutes for it to load it again.  It's clear that iPhones are much lower priority for Niantic, however if you force me to choose between playing Pokémon Go and owning an iPhone I'll ditch the game and keep my phone.  Get it together already. 
Hey I just wanna say that this game is awesome, every thing about it is amazing, one topic that I would like to bring up is the raid battles they are amazing I’ve been participating in a few now and I’ve recently one too it’s an amazing game but I would just love to see if they have more time to add on the raid battles because when trainers are fighting in the rates they are close to winning by the time runs out and that’s kind of why has me at a standstill but still other than that I really love the game and I would like to see a lot of more updates coming in the near future thank you Niantic
I love the game but when I was mandated to upgrade the game it has since then glitched. It goes half way of the beginning screen and won't log into the game. There shouldn't be a mandatory upgrade. This glitch has cause the game to now be unusable
I love this game but I only have two iPhone 4s and one iPad 9 so it crashes every time I open it on the iPhone 4s and on the iPad 9 it is pretty slow.PLEASE if you have a iPhone 4 or lower, DO NOT GET THIS APP.
I have never heard anything so annoying in my entire life. I would rather listen to rabbit scream than this god forsaken nightmare of a theme song. There is nothing worse than having your friends blast this music at max volume in your Honda Civic that can’t even support decent bass. I’m only giving this game two stars because of the half-decent gameplay, otherwise it’d be a good way to torture the ears of any sane human being.
In most areas there are very few pokestops and I just can’t go all over like that anymore wich leaves me with very few supplies
Don't know what's going on with the new update but I am having so much trouble with the latest version. It's super glitchy, it never seems to be able to load up completely my character is constantly greyed out, tried transferring a couple of my Pokémon recently and it just shows the pokeball loading symbol and then it will say network error and my Pokémon will disappear from my inventory without even giving me a candy.  In my Pokémon inventory a lot of my Pokémon will not display it will just show a name and no picture of a Pokémon at all. Overall just having trouble in general, not sure if anybody else is getting the same thing but it's getting annoying now.  Update 1.59.1 Problem with update is that my avatar doesn’t seem to register me walking or running well it will jump from one spot to another when I run and only seems to notice that when I try to click on a gym or pokestop. Anybody else having this issue? I am using an iPhone so not sure if it’s just an issue with iOS users. 
It never lets me catch raid bosses
Please make it possible for Pokémon to appear everywhere and not just in densely populated areas. Trying to catch Pokémon in my town is like trying to watch a movie at the theaters here, you can't because we don't have either of those. I also run into an Error (29) when I'm able to reach a gym. What's up with that?  12/05/17. GET IT TOGETHER Niantic. Your most recent update still hasn't fixed error (29). On top of that the app is now giving GPS signal errors and not as common but still enough to be notable error (30).  12/09/17. It's best to give praise where praise is due. This new update is surprising in that it's a bit more than what I expected in such a short time. Good job Niantic. I'll add more when and if I find more problems so BOLO.  12/13/17. All is good so far. I know that the battle party is in beta, but can the recommended parties not be a thing. I can't choose the party I want to take into a battle because it will only let me use the recommended party. It also gets really laggy when I try to edit it. I'll add more when and if I find more problems so BOLO.  1/25/18. There is a problem that occasionally pops up in the game. When I go to evolve Pokémon it won't play the animation but the Pokémon will still be evolved. Whenever this happens I end up not receiving any experience from the process. I'll add more when and if I find more problems so BOLO. 
Since the addition of more 3rd gen Pokémon my player doesn’t move for minutes and a time. Walk 3 blocks with no movement and then it just jumps, not giving me my distance walked nor do Pokémon spawn. Fix ASAP or I’m gone. Won’t beg to play a free game.
The only thing I would like to change is that you can evolve your poèmon wen ever you want
This is my dream, a game where it requires you to go outside!
It’s an overall good game and will get you addicted to catch as much Pokemon as you can. However, one issue I have is the raids. The problem for me is that it seems the time limit is inaccurate and even though I defeat the raid pokemon with a couple seconds to spare, the time still is up. I don’t know if this is supposed to happen but it is very frustrating wasting resources for nothing. Either way, great game.
There are increasing number of groups in my area who are organizing territories, Making it impossible for casual players to get coins or interact with gyms.  These territory players now sit in gyms for days with zero motivation because so few people bother to flip them.  They aren’t flipped because everyone in the area knows they will either show up for a prolonged berry fight (45m plus) or they will take the gym and be kicked out after 5m.   It’s hard to feel excited about this game when the 20 closest gyms to your house are not accessible.
Two days ago I put in a gloom in a gym today it came back and I got NO poke coins what so ever. Please fix this
so I have pokemon sun. And the game is so fun.
I think a better map for your badges would be cool  Love this game 
It’s a great game. But can you have an update where you can trade Pokémon and other stuff with other players. Also have it were you can sell pokeballs at pokestops to get coins. That would make the game way better.
I for one am big on character customizing from more clothing options to the colors you can pick from different body types because we all dont have that skinny figure, add an accessory tab were u can pick to add watches, bracelets, rings, n ect, as for the game its self it would be nice to see more battle options, were we can battle and challenge other players even train with ppl in our selected teams, allowing pokemon and trainers to level up (along with candies) so that players would have a more fare shot at capturing a legendary pokemon, i mean Pokemon is known for there gameboy battles so add something similar, am already drawn to the game but i want to be more into game ...
I can’t update Pokemon app
Hey I don’t know if anyone else is having the same problem but I am not getting ANY poke-coins when my Pokémon come back from gyms. A friend of mine that plays me says she gets hers but I am not even though our Pokémon have been at the same gym for the same amount of time. This is very upsetting 😡This happened after the latest update and I hope it gets fixed soon. Thanks for looking at my review and please send out bug fixes!
I love this game and playing it often. Is there a way to submit a location to become a PokéStop or Gym? We just had a major medical facility open up, has a tremendous amount of foot traffic
Pokémon in general are awesome to me. Pokémon go makes it a reality of being able to interact with Pokémon, not fully. Pokémon go is a great way to help me start walking around when there is a new Pokémon nearby. (however I’m never successful. 😂) But however, as amazing as this game is, I still wish you were able to interact with the Pokémon on a new level. In the Nintendo Pokémon games, you have the ability to play games, feed it, pet it, and raise its happiness. However this isn’t the case for Pokémon go. Giving players the experience to get to know their Pokémon and grow closer to them makes the game a lot more enjoyable, and gives perks in the actual game. Such as raising its happiness level, (which makes certain Pokémon evolve), raises its accuracy when it has higher happiness levels, and makes the Pokémon a lot more friendly, and more obedient. If the creators of Pokémon go just added this feature, I would be playing Pokemon go NON STOP. Literally, I would probably not stop playing. 😂 I’m sorry for rambling about, I’m done preaching. Thanks for listening to my wishes and my sincere gratitude for the creators, of Pokémon Go.
EX raids are stupid an unfair. Benefits spoofers and casuals more than regular raiders.
Well there’s all of these “unexpected errors” and it won’t let me creat a account so I’m gonna stick with roblox
Love the game just wondering if there will ever be an update where you can battle other players that are close to you
This game is great and I have hours upon hours in it. But the fact that if you live in even a somewhat small city you might as well give up unless you want to drive to other big cities. Please balance the game
I’m out of poke balls for catching Pokémon so can you give everyone 20 poke balls please and thank you.
I can’t update the game on my iPhone 6 Plus
Takes forever when starting the game for the nearby Pokémon to show up or the ones outside. If you select that you’re a passenger the warning shouldn’t keep popping up. It’s annoying.
Fun and lots of cool Pokémon 😀
I totally love this game!! It’s so great, but I would love if it was much easier to get Pokécoins. This probably won’t get looked at, but I figured I would try. It would be nice for the people that can’t go to gyms and get Pokécoins. It’s just a suggestion..Thank you!!
This fun game is the best game I ever played in my whole life I love how people just hunt the Pokémon and  get raids evolve Pokémon and power up plz get gen 4 out it will be a heaven life I love you niantic your the best plz make more Pokémon games too
Seriously I have 2 ex raids on a Wednesday! Do you know how inconvenient it is to have a raid of this magnitude on a day where EVERYONE has work!!!!! Kids are also in school so this does not make any sense!!!!!! Fix this issue and have raids exclusively on weekends or afternoons in the evenings. Fix it Niantic!
Of the game for about two years now and over the last two years it’s worked OK for me however there are a lot of problems. If you so that instead of releasing Johto and hoenn Pokémon I feel as though they should’ve fixed literally everything wrong with the game in about its first month. This game was Glitchey, With me constantly running into server problems on the first day and both with the Pokémon themselves on any day. I’m not saying that they should stop supporting the game in fact what I’m saying is that they should keep a better ion this game instead of just making way in way and way more money. The balls in Your Court, Niantic. If you can’t handle a game in franchise as love it as Pokémon. Then you should either. The service to another company like Nintendo or even game freak or just not have as high of a player account ever again as the first day because I remember the first day this game was released people in my city or just ecstatic everywhere I went that was a polka stop had people lining up to get these poke balls raspberries I don’t have a game at this point.So far what I was doing was checking to see what people responding to a mostly will serve her shoes so I download the game and to be honest with you I was a little bit disappointed but I still liked it. So like I said before Niantic either you get out of they are market or you give the servers the proper fix they deserve look people catch these beloved Pokémon.
The game is good and all but the screen where it says it needs a nickname for you, wouldn’t work. I put more than 100 different names and they all they “ That name is not available.” Please fix this problem, I really want to play this game too. Please fix it.
I play a iPhone 6s but I don’t even get the ar+ option when I tap a Pokémon but other than that I would truely love a aron as Pokémon community event! Everyone will be hunting for those amazing Aron’s especially those shinys! And it being new to Pokémon go it would be extra exciting! :)
This new update stopped the game from working on my sons ipad 4th generation, trying to force people to upgrade their devices, you lost 4 members of this household.
Here's an idea for an update: give a Pokestop a Pokémon Center function. I am burning through most of my potions and cannot seem to replenish them fast enough. It would be so much easier if I could go to a nearby location and heal my Pokémon instead of 1 revive plus several potions  Edit: I don’t know what’s the deal with determining who gets an EX raid pass, but I have never received one despite having raided several times at a known EX location in my hometown. How can I increase my chances? 
When I started i couldn’t see Pokémon
I was having a great time playing Pokémon Go with my kids again since Christmas break.  We hadn’t played since the summer the game came out and were thrilled with the new Pokémon.  Sunday night, the game randomly logged me out and now I can’t log back in.  I get a message that my username and/or password are incorrect.  I’ve tried to reset but it won’t let me.  I guess our Pokémon days are over.
Need to make it work on iPads
great game!could you possibly add stickers of cool Pokémon to use on imessage
My top goal for this game is to catch them all. Sadly I can’t do that because I live in a rural area. I don’t have any rare or legendary Pokémon for that reason. Please update so people like me can get the most out of the game!  Also my battery drains a ton when playing. If there’s a way to fix that too that will be great. 
This is Really fun game and I wish there were more pókestops and I need more poke balls and I also wish that the pokemon were a bit easier to catch but is still a great game!
This update seems to have fixed the glitches from the last one.
So this game was exciting at first. But when the new raid systems cane months ago I started to loose interest. And my husband completely stopped playing.   We both have jobs and children. We don’t have time to find “raid groups” to get the bigger bosses. Plus what’s the point of getting them if you can’t put them into gyms? I’m level 35 and have been for awhile. I wanted to get to 40 before giving up but what’s the point? 
I love this game so much. I enjoy playing with my dad and battling gyms. When I win at a gym I can place a Pokémon at the gym to help defend it. There are so many Pokémon and so many tricks to get them. I really do love Pokémon Go and I do recommend that you try it out.✌🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😎😎😎
Omg this game is amazing keep up the good work
I have a problem I’m level 26 and I still don’t have scyther can you make scyther more common at Vanderbilt public plaza?!?!
Great game but needs player vs player battles and trading like the original Pokemon games. Really needs player vs player battles also battle Pokémon outside the gym as well to level up the Pokémon and character !!! 
Many days I cannot capture Pokémon or get poke balls even when they are in range.   It’s random and very annoying because it puts my Day sequence back to one when I have several days.   All other apps on my phone work fine.   I have an iPhone 8 Plus with high data so this should not be happening.  I’m ready to pack it in because I don’t like or need this aggravation.
Finally fixed scroll bug. Thank u!
In every Pokémon game to date, you could go to a Pokemart and sell unwanted items for coins. Please allow us to sell items for PokéCoins rather than throwing out unnecessary items.
Add trading already you keep saying you will then do it that also the reason you keep losing players you aren’t keeping your promise
I’ve tried for months now and the app will not open/closes seconds into the app. I’ve deleted it, reinstalled it, restarted my phone, updated all software, waited for an update from Niantic, waited for an update from Apple, sent in a report to Niantic. I have no idea what else to do. I have an iPhone X.
When will we be able to start trading with fellow Pokémon Go goers? And a new poke stop popped up here in chinle az. Nice small town needs more better Pokémon. Glitches after I catch a Pokémon. Have to reset the app.  Over all I like the game. Go way back like Ash and pikachu. 
I love this game, I love Pokémon. But when I log in to see what’s out there… and 20 minutes later my account has been logged out… it’s actually bull****. Never logging out once I don’t remember my passwords, so I use forgot my username option. Ok, found my username. Try my only 2 passwords I ever use. Not working. I use the forgot my password option. Can’t be done till 15 mins after using the forgot my username. Ok… waits 20 mins, and it still prompts me to wait 15 mins. I’m done at this point so I wait another day. Forgot my password option works. Resets password. Tries to login on Pokémon go, incorrect password. Well, guess my account is just gone, thanks niantic. About a year of play and ~$50 later.
Love the game. It’s improved a lot since launch.  Raids, weather, new pokemon. The attack anims on the weasel-y style rigs are fun.  UX is still rocky.  The “GPS” error pane is SUPER annoying. It covers up lots of data you should still be able to see, like inventory, favorite star, etc. make that a flyout icon with a red exclamation point or something that we can close.  When you transfer anything, it resets your inventory view to the top every time. Moderately infuriating.  Would be great to just see actual stats for pokemon, instead of tapping through vague repetitive roleplay trainer dialogue. 
With this new update gym battles are slower a level 3 scyther nearly killed all my strongest Pokémon and I’m a level 34 trainer 😢
As someone who’s played since July 2017, I’ve seen a lot of changes to this game, both good and bad. My first complaint is the fact that ever since Gen 2 being added, you barely get any Gen 1 Pokémon like Eevee or even Zubat except for Pidgey and Rattata anymore, which can be a huge pain. Also as many people have said before me, the rural players matter too and it’s a shame they have such limited access to Pokémon. Another complaint I have is the raids, you can never really find one unless you live next to a gym, and most players can’t go there or don’t have time to go. And even if they can go, they still need more people to do it. My last complaint is that the passenger thing still pops up sometimes if I walk, something that has annoyed me countless times.  Niantic, Get some common sense and actually make some meaningful updates that fix these issues instead of “Bug fixes” which have proven sometimes to not be what they seem. I’m not touching this app until it’s at least mostly fixed, even though I know you don’t care about your player-base and will never read this. 
At the beginning of this games release it had problems which I think everyone expected but luckily you fixed upon that and have gotten pasted that but there are still some problems with the raids especially if you live in a small time like me and only like 10-15 people play the game so it’s pretty difficult to do raids I feel personally that you should have raids that people can do individual and not just as a team effort it would make small town players like me happy and help us out but overall an amazing game and I love playing it and if they tweaked a few things like raids I would definitely play this game a lot more
Love the game. Me and my kids catch Pokémon everyday but I wish we could battle the actual Pokémon or other players. As fun as it is for my kids to catch pikachu everyday it’d be nice to battle other players to prove myself like in the actual Nintendo games. Idk I can’t be the only one complaining about no battles
I live in Palestine and there is little Pokémon here so please put a lot of Pokémon and gyms and pokestops
Regular player since day 1. Thank you for fixing the thing where it sends the screen all the way up after transferring Pokemon, adding weather, showing the number of people in the lobby, and defaulting to the previously used type of pokeball.  Community Day was a great event and I look forward to the next; however, I would like to see a change in the EX raid system. My boyfriend and I finally got our first passes but will be unable to play as we have work on a Wednesday about 30-60 minutes from where the raid will be happening. Also, another local player pointed out that kids will be unable to attend as they should be in school. Perhaps making ex raids the same day as the raid they originated from would be a better option?   As for the Apple watch app, is there a way to send my daily steps from the Health app towards the steps in my egg? Why are the sessions in Pokemon Go+ so short? Why can't PoGo+ use balls other than pokeballs? 
Ok I have my update but why is not given revives in the gyms and on the raids lots of fruit and positions but not revives with Kyogre when he is boost we used lots of Pokémon to battle and we don’t have enough revives for the Pokémon please let us have revives .
One
I really like Pokémon GO. I like walking around and finding Pokémon in the world. I wish tracking were a thing, because it's exciting to follow clues to find something hidden.
Pretty much the best mobile game ever
Pretty much everything else is fine with the game except in the new update they said they improved scaling of the Pokémon models but WOW are they wack now. A Natu looks freaking huge while a Seviper looks tiny. Had to write a review just for this, please fix omg.
The community has weighed in but Niantic doesn't listen. #CoinFreeze
Something changed in the updates and I went from having way too many potions to now I have 124 revive and 5 total potions they changed the give outs and potions are hard to come by.
So its great but we need Pokemon centers and trading like those things and then it will be the best game in the world!!
Love the game! Only writing this because with the recent update none of my Pokémon have been collecting coins at gyms. And I know they have to stay for at least an hour but I’ve had multiple Pokémon in gyms for days before they’ve returned and haven’t receive any pokecoins
This game is awesome I love it!!! I play this game all the time!!!I have caught so many Pokémon and every day I fell like there will be a new update on this app! I liked the idea of this app I thought I would start to draw all the Pokémon that Niantic has!
I have been trying play this for almost an hour but it keeps exiting the game and I can't play it anymore 😭😭 fix this and I'll change my rating
I like it but I got really mad when I got into a raid center with tyranitar which is my favorite Pokémon so I got really mad and I said to my self focus on catching and don't worry about it so I did and the next day I got a pupitar so I got a little happier so yeah fun game but we need more preimum balls
Niantic should make is so that when you find a Pokémon you fight it and the lower the health the more chance of catching it.
Pokémon Go is the mix of a video game exercise, exploration, photo taking, traveling, & art. Plus if your looking to get your kids to exercise & be creative Pokémon Go is for you. For example kids want video games & parents want kids to play outside well Pokémon Go is the perfect app to install a good social balance between video games and exercise. P.S. Even adults play it.
Was a game a played everyday was a big part of the raiding groups around here and honestly after the ex raid passes have come out this game has lost its steam. So many people at the same raid from when the passes are given out get left out and that just defeats the hard work of having to go out. Frustrating watching other trainers get passes from a raid you did. I’ve seen multiple spoofers get multiple ex raid passes for one day alone. On top of that bug fixes don’t really fix the game they just cause more bugs or being back past ones I.e. the going back to the top of the Pokémon list after transferring Pokémon. Sad to say I’ve lost interest.
awesome app keep it up hope one day to see trades among trainers and battles among trainers soon
I am a Lvl 40 active player. I raid at least once a day at each known ex pass locations.  I have helped formed two groups to trigger two locations to drop passes. Today is the day I throw in the towel. After spending so much time and money on a game that rewards their casual players that play for free more often with ex raid passes then it does their paying active high level players, it is time to quit. Thanks for telling your player base to play more, raid more, increase gym badges to be rewarded with nothing.
I play Pokémon go on 2 accounts daily. I spend 80-120 monthly between the 2 buying raid passes, incubators and eggs. I raid at a variety of places and have raided on multiple occasions that EX passes were distributed and have yet to get an EX pass while some I raided with got one for the 5th to 10th time! This has happened on multiple occasions. The EX distribution is set and unfair, makes the ones that try to get one by following this games suggestions in the help center want to quit playing because we are still #TeamNoPass, while other players are sitting there getting one pass each distribution. This EX system either needs to be fixed or changed to 6star raids allowing EVERYONE the chance at the boss.   On top of that it is nearly impossible to contact Niantic to voice these complaints to get a actual response from them. 
Did I get banned or something to using the joystick and sitting being in a different state
The Ex Raid system is the most broken, idiotic, unnecessarily complicated mechanic to ever be devised by a gaming company. It does not reward hard work or persistence, but mediocrity and lack of effort. I’m a genuine lvl 40, have spent hundred of dollars in this game, have 50 gold gyms, done 340+ raids (most of which have been at ex raid gyms) and I'm one of the most active members in my instinct group. Yet, I am the only one to have not received an ex raid pass, while others are on their second and third. Niantic, this mechanic is broken, and quite honestly cruel. If you’re going to hold mewtwo back like this, give him away by actually accomplishing something meaningful, instead of doing a magikarp raid. I guess when it comes down to it, why give me a ex pass when I’m already a paying customer. F*** me right? Also, please fix the dodge glitch and just get your act together niantic!
I like Pokémon Go overall, but I fail to understand why you can’t catch Pokémon on an Apple Watch. This feature is available on the Pokémon Go Plus wristband. That accessory has no screen, and it makes no sense why this feature couldn’t be added to the Apple Watch. Once this feature is added I’ll give this game a higher rating.
There is no reason to be high level. You don't get higher ultra ball drops, you seem to never get an ex raid pass (even though your level 15 friends do). Game glitches and crashes a ton. Niantic had a golden opportunity to make an amazing game for everyone but, they have failed miserably.
Love the game, but lots of issues for scheduling. For people who have full schedules, the raids are often hard to get to. The invitation raids for MewTwo are super inconvenient. You can’t pick the time or place and often have work or school and can’t attend. There’s no way to reschedule them either. While they fix any bug issues very quickly, they aren’t considerate towards scheduling conflicts and make the legendary Pokémon raids next to impossible to be able to attend if you have school and a regular 9-5.
Since this newest update the game won’t start, it won’t finish uploading,it will not let me play.... WTH! 
I would love it if you could trade Pokémon with people in your contact list ...I know it’s not the same as actually catching and evolving them yourself...maybe set a limit ...I allowed my summer campers to have their phones while we went on daily walks and it distracted them from the fact that we walked a long distance without them complaining because we were catching Pokémon...
I live in a large city, so I should be seeing variety in Pokémon. I don’t. After a short time of a lot of the new generation spawning everywhere, it’s back to the same old Pokémon that I don’t need.
There is almost no point to battling in gyms. You don’t get good rewards and your Pokémon end up needing to be revived and potions which you don’t collect a lot. They clearly want you to use more of your real money. This game is made for their profit, not your entertainment.
Was glad to see that the scrolling glitch from the last update is fixed in the most recent. Too bad theres a new glitch now, even worse IMO. The kind of pokeball thrown no longer resets back to a normal pokeball with each new pokemon. So if you saw one you really wanted and threw an ultraball, regardless whether you caught it or not, the next pokemon you throw at will come up with an ultraball again as your initial default. If you dont notice and change it you will really quickly run thru your stash of fancier great and/or ultraballs. Very aggravating please fix it.
As much as I love the app, the recent update has made the GPS so inaccurate. I’m a college student and there is a gym right next to my dorm, which is great. But my character happens think that I am constantly way away from where I actually am. I just want to lay in bed and have access to the gym right next to me.
In 1.59.1 weedle is bigger than seviper and wailmer/wailord, groudon, kyogre still doesnt fit on the screen, they are soo big, even on iPhone X, need to improve it.
Still a dope game!! BUT! CP and HP still arranging as CP. can we fix that glitch? I think everything else is good! I’d just like to see what Pokémon has the highest HP when I view HP rather than the Pokémon being arranged my CP when viewing HP. GOTTA CATCH EM ALL!!
Keeps logging me out and I can’t get back into the app
Ok dang fix the dang AR because when i use AR it looks like dang plastic like make them move more (not erratic) so make something like a Ryhorn run arround and stuff or a vaporeon swimming in a lake or a wurmple digging in the ground you know? Better features. Also where the flipping cheesburgers with ketchup is the player vs player? If you do add it, Make it so there has to be equalized level cap. One mo ting... raids need to start right away.  No more egg thing. Instead just make it 3 hours long   PS: stop making the only way to get cool stuff is from poke coins... and there is no way you can save that many coins for that long just to afford a small box in the shop. Make it cheeper dang it. 
Good stuff mate
It was fun for a day or so, but now it’s lame.
With the new update, Pokémon go plus doesn’t work. I have read the reviews that started in July 2017 and nothing has been done to fix this? Is there a fix in progress? I have an accessory that is currently worthless. What’s the time line to correct this bug fix? If no fix in the near future then refund us trainers for the price of this accessory.
Pokémon Go Customer Support is a total joke.  The latest update signed me out and now I can’t sign back in, reset my password, or get any sort of live help.  If it’s there I just haven’t dug deep enough to find it.  Completely ridiculous and totally disappointing.
I live in a small town and there is NO pokestops and there’s no way to get pokeballs.Please add more pokestops
Sure it’s nice to be able to see what Pokémon spawn at which poke stops. But there is no way of judging where a wild Pokémon is otherwise. Earlier today a wild snorlax spawned near my house (where  are no poke stops nearby) I walked around in every direction for almost a kilometer in total and no matter which direction I moved the Pokémon pushed further back in the nearby.  ( It would also be nice to have a poke stop in my neighborhood.) Pokémon, nonetheless, is a great game but it would be nice if they could add a cone, of general direction, or distance to the Pokémon in a future update.  Question, did they change the gold you get from gyms or was that just a one-time glitch (I only got 3 poké coins for a Pokémon knocked out of a gym and my best Pokémon has been in a gym for a week but I get no coins in the meantime)  Sorry to blabber on for so long just leaving a few suggestions that might help bring back some of the on\off players that have been popping up in my neighborhood wanting to get back in the game and wanting more for it.  Happy community day, Mstscott 
I’ve loved this game since I was 5 years old playing on the gameboy. I love this game now, but I am not able to play today because the app was just updated recently and it is unable to authenticate my account. A group of us, about 30 or so, are wondering when this issue will be resolved. Most of us have spent actual money on this game, not only to have the little extra perks provided with the use of pokecoins, but also in the hopes that things like an authentication issue do not happen. I don’t know how Niantic thinks or the Pokémon Company for that matter, but most people like to spend their money on things that work and are worth it. I am giving this game a 5 star rating. The ratings are what keep the game rolling if I’m not mistaken. My friends will not be so generous. The following message is for the developers: these issues are causing you to lose players and ratings, please fix the issues to give us a reason to play again.  Thank you. 
Can’t log in after the recent update yesterday telling me unable to authenticate. Why? When it was working fine yesterday. Anyone else experiencing this?
I have been a fan of Pokemon since the first movie came out. I was 5. Since the release of Pokemon Go, I have been an avid player, even as a college student. I’d stay up well into the night catching Pokémon and battling gyms down to position one of my own Pokémon in the gym.  However, here recently I started working full-time, and don’t have as much free time as I once had. I missed Suicune because of work and will likely miss Ho-Oh because of it, too. I just wish I had more time or ability to catch these legendaries. Since I caught Entei, I haven’t been able to catch any other legendary, including the Mewtwo I battled after biking the 2 miles or so down one of the busiest streets in my city. I’ve recently captured Groudon, but not without extreme struggle.  Today, the app would not allow me to login due to it having a problem authenticating the Google server. Here’s to hoping I don’t miss my PokeStop Day Streak! 
With the new update it will not me log in
Can’t login after recent update. Please fix.   I enjoy catching the Pokémon but other than that idk what I’m doing. A nice time out for my busy day. 
I can’t log in to Pokémon go now that it updated. It won’t connect to my google account and I can’t access any information through the app. I’m completely locked out.
The newest update kicked me out of the app and I can’t log back in. It says it can’t authenticate my log in. I have been logged in with google since the app came out and I play regularly. The fact that I can’t log back in is irksome.
Somehow got logged out of my gmail linked account, now I can’t access my profile 😭
You won’t remember my username or password after being loyal since you started then I’ll go ahead and stop using it. Thanks for being loyal to the loyal fans!
Are the servers down because it won’t let me sign in with my Gmail at all
I can’t log into Pokémon and it says when I want to log in that my google account unable to authenticate  why?????
I can’t sign in whatsoever......
I’ve been able to play it before but recently it won’t let me or my family access any of our accounts on this device doesn’t even give us the chance to log in please fix this bug but overall Pokémon GO is a wonderful game
Keeps saying unable to authenticate
The game once again logs me out to loose my progress.. makes me really rethink playing. The game will not allow me to log back in and there is constant issues with lag. Please update the game!!!
Love this game SOOOO much PLEASE FIX THE BUGD
Won't let me sign into the app. So, are you gonna a fix this.............
Can’t login via google or Pokémon club. Can’t play at all.
Just updated my game recently and it said failed login, so I tried to go to “try different” something or other, and it won’t even let me try to put into my log in information. Just keeps saying “unable to authenticate, please try again”.
Great addicting game but keeps freezing on me
I love this game except it would be better if you enter in your location and you have s filter where you choose a Pokémon and it shows sightings of it in a one mile radius
I’ve played since day one and I think they did an awesome job for those who have played Pokémon since the 90s all the way to those who are completely new to this world. The new updates have been really fun with the Pokémon showing up based on the weather and I’m SO glad the scrolling glitch is gone! I live in a smaller town and I rarely run out of the items I need; people just complain too much. 5/5!
I used to Love Pokémon go but now it’s crap.it was fine how it was no changes were needed. You lost and a bunch of other people to not play. What the crap is Pokémon trainer club?!
Nice fun game but when I try to make an account it says that my username and or password is invalid but it is not invalid and why do you need a built in gps instead of buying a gps app
thank you for fixing the problem/problems like the crashing
It just won’t load when I do the Pokémon trainer club
Previous one star review - What’s happened to the pokemon list UX?  Every time you transfer or evolve the Pokemon the list returns to the top. Madness. I guess an intern with no user experience training broke the code?  Can’t believe that they did this intentionally, especially after increasing the maximum number of Pokemon to 1500...   I hope that this level of QA testing isn’t the new norm! 
I love the game. Next update should consist of battery efficiency when using the app. More poke stops in urban areas
Why the f*** dose this game take so long to start up on the newest iPhone that’s my only complaint this game is great
I'm very disappointed I will no longer be able to play because my phone is a 5c. My phone works fine and have no reason to upgrade. (Also can't afford too upgrade) I have been playing since the game launched and am sad I will no longer be able to play.
Well, great. You fixed one bug (see below) only to give us another bug! Now we cannot scroll the Pokédex! Argh!   Really annoyed that when I favorite a Pokémon or trade it for a candy it then sends me all the way back to the top of the list. So irritating to have to keep scrolling back down as I’m trying to go through my list. Why did you change that???? Ugh! 
Previously I'd felt that Pokemon GO had too little depth to it to be successful in the long run. That remains absolutely true, the game struggles to be more than repetitive and, one month in Niantic has offered a few bug fixes but nothing else.  Add to that the game's uncontrolled power curve. A few types are terribly over powered, water and dragon, while bug types and normal types struggle to keep up. Niantic managed to capture some of the spirit of Pokémon, namely the capturing portion of the original games, but the company has created an unbalanced power curve which cannot be overcome by trainers since a Pokémon strength is based on it's CP which is capped relative to your level in the game and the amount of stardust you can collect.  I hope Niantic realizes that this game which is played daily by about 7% of the US population, is woefully under developed and suffering from a simplistic combat system, unbalanced soft stats, poor search mechanics, and a general lack of communication. Niantic should be horrified that a launch this big has, currently, a 2.2 rating on the App Store.  Pokemon GO is flopping big time and I don't think Niantic is the company to save it. The Pokémon Company has made a huge mistake in their choice of a developer.  *Update*  I just uninstalled Pokémon Go from my phone because, as has been born out since day 1, the game has failed to mature. I grew up with Pokémon on the Gameboy and the instinct to battle is still hardwired into me by the old GB version which is what “Go” lacks. If trainer battles ever become a thing I may be back but I’m tired of hustling gyms and tapping. The screen over and over and over with little thought involved. 
Things keep getting better with updates. But we still have the problem of the game randomly despawning all Pokémon in the area. I have to force close and reopen the app for them to show back up.
I love the inclusion of gen 3, however I feel like gyms are a lost cause, if a Pokémon is not pampered for a few days it's CP drops a lot more than a pokemon defeating it, if you could make gyms have the same cp that would be great.
Please can you add more for the characters customization every character looks the same and the only colors are team colors and could you maybe add a lil hat or something to put on your partner
This is a great game and I like playing it but I think the battle option would be a great feature to integrate in order for users to play and battle with friends. I think transferring Pokémon with friends would also be a cool feature to integrate since you could transfer Pokémon with friends who have Pokémon you don’t and vise versa
Love the new stuff! Don’t know why people hate it?
They fixed the issue of having to scroll down every time a Pokémon is transferred. Thank you.
I feel Pokémon Go was a great concept and the commercials were amazing. Unfortunately this was nothing like the game. The servers are bad, The glitches are bad, and you can hardly ever get in the game! I seriously hope they can fix these bugs, and make the game as good as it should be.       Thanks! 
I cough a Mewtwo it registered to the Pokédex in then it turned out to be a new two and it’s level went down.
Need easier raids for small children
I was feeling so depressed and horrible for couple of months. Even worse, the weather is not very helping, as i live in northern hemisphere, meaning it is winter now. All day dark and bleak.  One day, i thought to myself, i need to get out of my room and take a fresh air, at least that would help me cope with my depression for a bit. I decided to re-download pokemon go & resume my progress on where i left off. At first i was quite reluctant to go out and chase off Pokemons, and then after few weeks, i feel much better, i started to go out on regular basis, albeit just couple of hours, in order to hatch the eggs, defend my gyms, defeat and conquer other gyms and catching pokemon. My friends have been following my progress and they have been quite supportive, sometimes they go out with me just to accompany me catch pokemon and talking about problems and stuffs. I am grateful for the Niantic team, for making this game. I am still battling with my depression, but ever-since i know that i have pokemons to chase and evolve, i am hopeful that i will cope out. xoxo
I used to like playing this game, but now when you open it, it takes around two minutes just to load thanks to all of the updates and stuff. I would start to play it again if they could speed that up. It’s very frustrating when I know I’ll have to wait a few minutes just to open it once to get a Pokéstop.
ERROR GPS SIGNAL NOT FOUND. (11) is the message I get almost every time I enter the game! It doesn't load and it won't even work when I'm using wifi!? I love the game but Niantec needs to fix this now. It ruins the gaming experience.
I've been a loyal player since the game was released, and I love it and meeting new people at raids. Only issue I’ve encountered w/the new update is that the app seems to freeze up or quit running when in the background like it used to before the last update that had fixed that. This is difficult for me since I also play Ingress and usually have that in the screen and switch back and forth between that & Pokémon Go. I’ve noticed that since the most recent update, my Pokémon Go app running in the background prevents Pokémon from spawning & doesn’t track my movement like when you’re going too fast, but I’m walking so hope they fix this minor issue.

Awesome game! Tons of cute and realistic Pokémon to catch! With my obsession over Japanese things, this game really makes me smile. Only one thing: every time I try to get on, it kicks me off immediately. Please fix this bug. Thank you!
...thanks for fixing the list issue, but now every time you go to capture a Pokémon it automatically starts with the same type of ball you used last. Instead of always starting with a regular pokeball. Very annoying.
Your update is in another castle:  • still poor tracking • still no trading • still no battling friends • still no way to improve Pokémon • still no way to learn/pick attacks • still a city-slicker's game • still very buggy at the worst times❗️ 
you made it impossible to catch certain Pokémon. You take too long for updates. And, you lied about trading, and you lied about breeding.👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
This is the best game ever
thank you for fixing the plus finally!!!
I have been playing this game since the beginning. I’ve seen the high points and low points, but lately I have not been able to heal my Pokémon due to the major lack of potion appearances. I hope this will be resolved soon so I can attack those gyms!
It’s really annoying to register because it doesn’t do anything it just resets so I can register.
The game is awesome but sometimes the game glitches and the gps signal is not found
The game won’t let me log on even though my dad made me an account and my iPod was version 10 it is pretty stupid.that needs fixed
I love this game but I wish there were unlimited poke balls
There are literally no Pokémon here.
I feel we should be able to see are buddy Pokémon walk with the player because it makes no sense for a Pokémon to walk without seeing the Pokémon walk
I love this game and play it almost everyday however there is a currently unresolved glitch that is making it very hard to play. Every time I change the name, transfer, level up, or evolve any single Pokémon, I am brought to the top of my Pokémon list which is a huge hinderance when trying to clear space.
During the event today I caught quite a few pikachu with surf, and was happy. Just before 4:00 in Texas it was raining, and I tapped on a shiny pikachu. The ring of stars circled the dark yellowish pokemon, and considering on my account I have shiny gyrados, dusclops, and sableye, I have experience & knew it was shiny. I caught it with a golden razzberry & ultra ball. Then the screen display showed me a regular nonshiny pikachu. It was 4:02 at the time & the rain and event stopped. My pikachu also didn’t have the move surf. I am angry, but I’m writing this review because bugs and problems like this are exactly why Pokemon has lost its appeal for most players. This has to stop, because as a player, I was ready to quit. I’m aware that once a weather change takes place pokemon reset, but I had already tapped on it during the event & rain. I should have lost the boost & move surf, but to completley change the pokemon including its shiny status is infuriating and harmful to the company as a whole. 
Can’t catch new legendary. Bugged
You should give a 5 candys for a pokemon on a gym
It’s good I like the updates and all the Pokémon
Pokemon go has been so fun and I can't stop playing so you shouldn't either valor mystic and instinct life
DA DA DA DA DA
I’m sure every Pokémon player would like to see a system were we can go against each other one vs one battle that would make things very interesting. Pokémon Go popularity would shoot up again.
Gets boring after a while. When you’re not seeing new Pokémon. But still an awesome game and a lot of fun. Much more fun in the Spring/Summer.
I evolved my surf pikachu but it doesn’t turn into a surf Raichu
You really need to test new releases better. New bug added in this update... when you use a Great or Ultra ball to catch a Pokémon when you try to catch another Pokémon the ball defaults to last used.
Can’t change the hairstyle of the trainers which is a bit of a bummer ‘cause I’m constantly changing my own hair and I’d love for her to match. The new AR mode doesn’t work @ all for me, no matter how long I point my phone @ a flat surface and then move it around slowly.
After the last update the Pokémon shrank a lot.
Everytime I try to catch the Pokémon since 1:00 it goes to a different Pokémon after its already been caught
I’ve played Pokémon go since it launched but quit before because it got bland. Happy to see all the new things added and the community days. HUGE SUGGESTION: make the special Pokémon available something rare (like a porygon) but make them more scarce so people actually have to walk around to find them. The “event” pikachu is popping out everywhere in my game and nothing makes them special except for a move. Even though it is different, it doesn’t make it better.
Thank goodness
I still love this game.  It keeps me walking when I really don’t feel like it.  Glad you fixed the previous problem, but now there seems to be a new one.  When I switched to an ultra ball to catch a difficult Pokémon it didn’t switch back to a regular ball on the next Pokémon and I wasted a couple of those precious balls before I noticed.  Please fix!!!
Hello , I was actually thinking of this for a while the niantic company should make a new update that allows you too see how many ppl are in the lobby by clicking on the gym from far away or have a numbers on top of the gym that you can see from far away in your Pokémon map , that way ppl can see that they are raiding and ppl can hurry to go fight cause they see ppl are waiting in the lobby to fight , what do you guys think ? .. and you guys need to fix the problem with the gym cause I’m mystic team and I drop a Pokémon at a gym for my coins and I check my Pokémon on my list and it has a red mark like if I’m Team Valor , does anybody have this problem.?
Niantic you should add trading in a update so when your near a player you can trade with that person or someone plzz if you add it will be nice
This game rocks, and I love it. But, the only problem is that we still don’t have trading..... and this game is FAR from being somewhat balanced and fair to rural players. There is a big community, and I would love to see some changes, and for them to finally implement trading. Aside from that, it’s a really great game and you should cop it.
I got a username and a password and put it in exactly how it said it was and it still won’t let me sign in.
The game is awesome. Love all the mechanics of game play. The gym battles, the poke stops. Actually have reach lvl 29 and have just stopped playing. Every now and then I’ll pop on because of how boring it gets.  Tired of seeing pidgins and all the other low end pokies. I expected a more greater challenge. I’ve tried all the tactical moves, lures and perfumes.  But I either see all the low ends or absolutely nothing appears until the luring items wear off. Please make it more challenging for the higher levels.
The way Pokemon scale in the power up screen is just horrible... Recent update made scaling even worse, for some Pokemon.  Various Pokemon have been moved up, so now it's hard to tell their CP or even see them in their full scale and beauty..., Pokemon which were affected are - Lugia, Ho-Oh, Kyogre, Dragonite, Kingdra, Groudon is just plain gigantic (covering CP and power up arc), Wailmer and Wailord. Since I haven't discovered all Pokemon, I'm sure there are plenty more Pokemon that needs fixing. Please fix this issue, it is much needed.  iPhone X, iOS 11.2.2 Overall though, great job on the game!🤗👍 
Trying to evolve Pokémon right after I catch them does not show animation and sometimes freezes. When I reboot the game the Pokémon is evolve but I’m not sure if I got the xp for it. Thank you for fixing the scrolling Pokémon box bug as well.
I had made a pokemon go account and when I try to sign in it won’t sign me in. It will just sit there for hours doing nothing but showing a pokeball spinning for infinite.
I love Pokémon go. My phone says the game updated but it didn’t actually update. None of the bugs are fixed, I still have the Christmas opening screen, and I can’t sort by region. What’s the deal Pokémon? Why you slippin?
So far the game is good but I’d really love if you could view your own Pokémon in AR. Maybe make a “view in AR” option or button when you open up the Pokémon’s page, I’d love to see my Charizard in my living room using that function.
you should be able to battle the pokémon you encounter🙄
Thanks for fixing the scrolling issue!
Dis game nice
I like it, but servers are trash. If they get better I'll change rating accordingly. And now its gotten worse with the removal of the step system. Fix your game niantic 
I do love this game but you never add other regions after a little while. I wish you could add the Sinnoh region, Unova region, and the Kalos region. Plus I want the starter Pokémon’s final evolved forms to only be 50 candies and not 100, because that takes way too long. And I think to evolve your Kirla into a Gardevoir it will probably take 100 candies. I really want a Gardevoir, so please make it 50 candies.
they have you spend money in this game and then give you glitchy gameplay in return or in many apple user’s case, a device that doesn’t work. niantic = scam artists
I have the newest version and the most important thing I was waiting to be fixed was the scrolling back to the top when you transfer , evolve , appraise. This is still happening even with the newest version.
You should add to the game mega evaloution. And add a key stone/mega stone to the game.you get the stone from a poke stop or a raid after you defeat the boss
I downloaded the game a month after it’s launch, and I have enjoyed it.    Until all of the updates started coming out, creating bug after bug, and every time you guys fix a bug it created another one.   I just recently reached 10K to hatch my first 10K egg, and I didn’t get my egg it never hatched it just disappeared! So I get screwed out of that, so I’m done with it I’m going to delete this app. It’s just not worth it since you guys can’t fix a bug without creating another bug. 
It’s been about month since Niantic decided to nearly stop giving out revives and hyper/max potions from pokestops in gyms. It’s almost as if they’re trying to force players into buying their revives from the store with actual money, another problem they have not fixed is their ex raid system. The ex system claims to hand out passes to those that have high leveled gym badges at sponsored gyms and parks, however it’s obvious that low level players are more likely to receive a pass than even those that have a golden gym badge at the selected gym. I have yet to receive a pas despite constantly raiding sponsored gyms daily and it’s extremely frustrating pretty soon I will end up quitting the game if I can not obtain one.
I love this app but I’d love it if they came of with a thing to change your team just like they came out with change your username
Kicks out of raid, timer runs out, couldn’t even start raid and it took raid pass. (5 Star raid)
It’s been a bit over 6 months and they have yet to fix the problem with ios11 and the Go+. Have tried to contact Niantic multiple times about a refund and they never email you back.
Honestly I don’t like it any more!  The previous gym battle system more attractive. Now if you don’t feeding your Potemkin's you will lose them very easy  Don’t even try to play it if you don’t download it yet !! 
Thanks for fixing the scrolling issue! It’d gotten so inconvenient that I didn’t feel like playing anymore. Now all you have to do is give us MORE STORAGE SPACE.
Thank you for FINALLY releasing the update.
Loving the game. Is the bug for the Pokémon Go Plus for iPhone fixed yet?
First for 2018’s new update it’s a rlly good game STILL ALIVE STILL ALIVE STILL ALIVE ...
Been playing this game for a while and really enjoy it but recent updates have caused my Pokémon go plus to stop working and it doesn’t seem like it’s going to be fixed any time soon. Spent 30 dollars on the external device since I work a lot and it makes playing more convenient for me and now it is useless and my gameplay has stalled.
Better
I have an up to date app and iPhone 7+, but there is no AR option- anyone know why?
Thanks for fixing the weird transfer bug (resets to the top of the menu).  Overall really fun. I still play this with my kids on the weekends. 
I updated this game and it deleted all of my diamonds!!! >:(
Waste my money for this game. Can’t make good curve balls at all for kyogre for the narrow bezel iPhone X .  And once I disabled AR+, the option to turn in is gone from setting. Zero star for this game this moment.
I'm sure this is a great game, I will change my review if someone can help, I'm stuck on the tutorial because the professor says catch a Pokémon and I'm standing right on top of them there's three(Charmander Squirtle and Bulbasaur) and I click ever where and NOTHING happens ;-; someone please help me if you can.
Hey ull need to add the real Pokémon sound plz
❗️Ok where do I start oh I KNOW!! First make batting Pokémon when you find them in the wild 2 MAKE LEGENDARY LIMITED TO A PLAYER 1 player only need one legendary 3 MAKE MASTER BALLS!! 4 HUMMM I DONT KNOW! STOPPPPP THE STUPID PIKACHU EVENT 5 FIX THE GYMS  AND RAIDS   7 if you do all of this I might start playing more frequently 
Come on Apple get us the update for 2018 before 1/20/18! I love Apple but these late updates are really frustrating to say the least. When can we expect you to get this done for us ? The bug fixes are working great so fingers crossed no more freezing while you are in a Raid battle!
game is very buggy, pokeball in a raid just falls off even without you throwing. Kyogre is a joke to catch
Love the app. Just want one thing. Can you guys make this game more like Pokémon? I get that you guys can't make it exactly like Pokémon but I would like a battle system, tall grass areas, and a Pokémon league like in the games. lol a DS Pokémon game except you have to walk to get where you want. If you guys can, have the legendaries roam and make it so there's one league/ group of legendaries every 5 square miles. This would make the game a lot more fun for fans that grew up with the original games.
Will the App Store provide us the update for this app??
It’s fun to get out, meet people, be active & play casually.
...the nerfed rate of revives/max revives are making it harder and harder to raid consistently, which is required to get enough candies to power up legendaries or get a shot at an EX Raid pass, which is a system that needs a rework too.   Also, weather boosted mons are great and all, but in my area the weather BARELY changes who spawns. I see more fire Pokémon in rainy weather than I do water Pokémon. 
I’m in a small but historical town so we naturally have plenty of poke-stops and gyms but that’s not what I want. The problem is with the new update not out on iOS in our town we have enough people to do raids and we get together to do kyroge and once we take it down it’s impossible to catch and I have like 13 dead Pokémon so I would like you short term give IOS users a lot of revives and long term create Pokémon centers but to make it balanced you could let it be time based like leave it in there for 8 hours and it will be revived after then and if you want to speed it up you could use pokecoins. Anyways I thought it was a cool idea I love you guys and your game.
Why is everything about the Raid system random? Random raid boss, random start time, random gym location. Can you just make it more consistent?   I want to be able to go to ANY gym and fight ANY raid boss at ANY time. This would help the player community organize Raids better (more participation= more money for you guys right?) if you knew you could, say, show up on a Saturday at 12 noon and know a specific Raid would happen   You could still keep the raid pass system (I.e. one free raid pass per day) in order to regulate it all (again I realize you guys need to make money) just make it more convenient for us too please.   I like the game. Wish I didn’t have to give it one-star but I feel like I need to to get this review looked at. 
Pokemon is a very fun but, Kyogre is so freakin hard to catch. I’ve fought him 8 times and out of those 8 times I only caught him twice. Pls make it little easier to catch.🙏🏾👌🏿
Good app but slow to push out updates for iOS
Been playing this game since it came out and I have gotten almost all of them, and I have raid almost everyday but still have not gotten an ex raid pass. I’m very disappointed in the way the ex raid passes are being dealt with.
I never get revives anymore. This is getting frustrating!
This game is fairly decent, but has some definite bugs to work out. I’ve never done a raid battle, because I’ve never seen one happen in my town. I work a lot of nights and whenever I do make it out and about, the Raid battles are either not an option or just not there. I’ve had the same raid pass since I came back to the game (played for awhile when it first came out and quit due to lack of interest) and no clue how to even use it. All the research I’ve done says raids happen during the day, but I’ve still yet to see one raid battle in my town no matter what time I go out.
First off, I love Pokémon Go. I have been an active player since the first summer where it blew up and remained loyal throughout the year when much of the player base dropped off. It had been a great reason for me to get out and go to the park, to the park in the next neighborhood over, down the street, up the street, anywhere really. I thoroughly enjoy playing it in my daily routine and have reached level 37 with frugal spending and smart allocation of resources. I have defended the game to many friends of mine despite agreeing with their sentiments about the lack of trading and PVP. I have however become incredibly frustrated with the game as of late.  The source of my frustration is the EX raids. These exclusive “invite-only” raids are supposedly awarded to those who raid frequently at parks or sponsored locations but despite my greatest efforts I cannot seem to earn one to save my life. I raid daily and these recommended locations and have spent some real cash trying to ensure I can get at least one EX pass but so far I have received nothing. I have done hundreds of raids and spent countless hours doing this, which isn’t easy for me because I don’t have a car, and every single time passes go out the game skips me. My roommate who does a fraction of the raids that I do, who I usually drag outside to come raid, has received 2 passes in the last month and I was skipped despite raiding with him for the raids he was awarded a pass for. I don’t know what else there is to do, I keep trying to raid as much as I can but I can’t do anymore without neglecting my day job or other responsibilities.   Basically, these EX raids are only “special” because the EXCLUDE people. This is not a good system especially because the requirements to earn an EX pass are incredibly vague and unclear. Where niantic tells us that they reward people for their hard work the game seems to do the opposite and seemingly skips many who make a conscious effort to earn one of these passes in favor of lower level accounts who have received many EX passes before. Someone I know in my town has received 9 EX passes already and me and many others have never ever been invited. These raids are the only way in the game to catch the highly coveted mewtwo and it’s incredibly unfair that it arbitrarily awards these passes to people rather than rewarding people who are dedicated to the game. It’s seriously making the game less fun. I would have awarded the game 4/5 stars only because of the lack of trading and PvP but these EX raids are making the game frustrating and depressing when you put all this time and money into trying to earn a pass and you come up empty handed. I’m still actively trying to earn one but if they switch the EX boss from mewtwo and deny me my chance to catch one I will definitely quit the game and save myself the headache and the trouble. It’s been very upsetting for me too because I loved the game so much despite its flaws. 
Growing up being a huge fan of Pokémon I just can’t believe how infuriating this game is!!! In the rural areas there are barely any poke-stops. The urban areas have mass amounts of them and them but why?? There are barely any variety of Pokémon in the rural area where I live as well.. 😩😩 The worst thing I have been noticing is the hardcore LAG that occurs during raid battles or gym battles.... Most of the time I can’t even dodge an attack because of the overwhelming LAG!!! This game needs to be fixed!! Spending money on a game that cheats!!! 😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬
What is this?I can't play!
This game is great and the up tases are phenomenal the only thing that could make it better is if you could sync it with a fitness tracker that counted your steps so the eggs would be able to hatch even if your phone isnt on or opened onto Pokémon go because that eats my battery and data.
There have been a few times where I’ve been in a very large raid group (10-20 people) and a few of us will get kicked out in the middle of the battle and we won’t be allowed back in (even when there’s time left on the clock) to catch the Pokemon. There have been times where after this glitch happens, I will still have my raid pass, but all of my Pokemon will be injured or knocked out. There are also times where I have lost my raid pass in this glitch and it causes me to have to buy another one on the spot. It’s very frustrating and embarrassing to commute far out to meet up with a raid group, only to have the game glitch out on me. I’ve been playing this game since the day it came out and glitches like this cause me to get very discouraged and flustered.   That being said, I love this game so much; it truly makes my long walk into work better and more fun, AND it encourages me to go out for walks during my lunch break. I would say that it has been a very positive influence on my life and some of my friends lives. It makes my day more exciting, and it helps me feel a level of nostalgia considering I played all of the Pokemon games growing up. I hope this game is up and running forever, I just wish that some of the gym issues would get cleaned up a bit :) 
I remember playing the first games on the original Gameboy for hours. PoGo has captured the nostalgia and translated it into a game that gets players moving and exploring the world around them.   While I certainly would love to see some new elements added to the experience (quests, regional rotations, trading, etc.) the core of this game has evolved in a way to make it sustainable for some time. Battling over gyms can be challenging. Tracking down rare Pokemon is almost always rewarding. And I have discovered new places I would have never wandered I to if not for the game.   To expand on the couple suggestions above, in case Niantic ever reviews these comments...  Quests could be a great way to allow players unable to travel a way to get rare regional Pokemon. It also can give level 40 players new achievements to shoot for when they have reached the max level.   Regional Pokemon is a nice concept but is unfair for players with limited funds or travel ability. I know the game is made to get people out to explore but players should not be punished for being unable to jump on a plane and go abroad.   Trading could also help with some of the exclusivity of Pokemon related to travel or related to accessibility (with consideration for those in lower population areas).   Direct battling is something that every player wants but has not been modeled yet in-game or in previews.   I’ve got other suggestions but only as a fan who appreciates the game that has been created. 
Ex Raids are ruining the game. It's unfair that so few people are getting multiple chances to catch Mewtwo. The system is broken. So many people are quitting because of this failed feature.
The game won't update past version 0.87.5 despite App Store saying it's up to date.
Always have enjoyed playing the game! Updates and enhancements are improving the game more and more.  Gyms could be sped up a bit with the transitions, and I do miss "training" up gyms past level 6.  Overall keep up the great work developers, excellent game!
Great game, just needs some work. When you are the only team instinct in your neighborhood and you are constantly battling to get at least one gym to show for it. Sometimes that is hard to do when you have absolutely no potions. After about two hours of walking around downtown, I’ll check my items only to see I got only anywhere from 4-10 potions. And this is something I don’t like, I under stand you guys are trying to make money and all by forcing people to buy potions so they can play you’re game, but seriously though. You need to fix this.
Please add trading please and the features were we can see other players!!!!!! Also this new AR thing doesn’t work I have an iPhone6 that’s up to date and it still doesn’t work why??
My character is being a complete idiot when it comes to walking. He either goes in the wrong direction, or stays still. I referred to the critical issues area. And according to that, It’s completely normal. I have a IPhone 6S. Please help ASAP.
If y’all loose another one of my accounts. Y’all will loose 500 players in my area. Good luck. I want my accounts back
I hate it do not waste your time
For a game that's been out this long, it's unheard of to find such an unpolished game full of crashes!!!! FIRE whoever is in charge of stabilizing the game because it is ridiculous that you get away with a game with so many bugs in the game. They can't even get the little things right. And to in charge of the next Harry Potter game, are you kidding me?
I would love if you fixed how you did the Ex-raid system....maybe something a person could purchase a special raid pass and offer the raid every other week or so. I have been playing solid for almost a year and raid regularly and still have not received an Ex-raid pass!
On Pokémon go it's good but it takes for ever to load even with the fastest Internet it does I like this game really long time but then now that they started updating and putting crazy ex why am mega EAX is just boring now but now that I have a drone I don't even have to do anything I can just fly my drone around with my iPad attached to it so I wanna give it to write it five star
If you have an iPhone X don’t download this game.  They made it cheaply for this phone and made it to where you can’t throw your pokeballs far. Avoid this trash on iPhone X!
Lately my game makes me walk in place when in reality I’m on the move. So when I’m passing gyms and poke stops, it stays right where I first opened up the game.  I tried reinstalling and everything. Makes me not want to play.
Since introducing the EX system we have played and played and played raid after raid after raid and still no EX pass yet the neighboring town that has 1/2 the players has had 11 know. We’ve even went to the neighboring town and raid still no raid pass oh and yes we have fold gyms yes we play everyday and yes there are more than 5 of us. We typically have to do 2 groups there are so many of us. PS add better spawn rate of shiney’s.
I’ve been playing since the game came out. Recently I’ve noticed that after transferring a Pokémon, it scrolls back to the top of the list. It’s super annoying to have to scroll back down to where I was and to keep having to go back and forth. Also as a rural player it’s still hard to get many of the legendary Pokémon. I’m hoping they bring some of them back so I can complete my Pokédex.
Love this app I get to play this app with my oldest daughter but I would like to make a request when When you go on your app and you go to where your Pokémon’s are and it has the combat number and the name the The Favorites they should be also a place where it shows that your Pokémon is on a gym so you can quickly click on that spot and it shows all the Pokémon‘s that are on a gym quick and easy
I waited 6 months to upgrade to iOS 11 to make sure the bugs would be worked out, but sadly after upgrading to iOS 11, my avatar is frozen unless I repeatedly refresh the app.  The game is now unplayable, and until there’s a fix, I’ve decide to uninstall the app.
My daughter was playing this but got murdered by a man that was sneaking up behind her. There was bLoodDeAtH all over her phone. aT LeasT sHe caUghT BuLbAsoUr1010102001010101092292999190101010101010100101010101110101010010000010111110MURderFromM3110019292929283838299292919101011010101
Please please fix the bug that jumps you back up to the top of your Pokémon list. I really enjoy this game. Please fix this bug!
Whatever you guys last changed I literally cannot access the ap to play or delete. You guys ruined everything. I have to find the ap in the store now and it was my most used before this
The game is alright, but could do better with more shops
We are waiting for trades and normal battles with our friends please do it if u do it i will give u 5 stars : )
I AM SERIOUSLY DONE WITH STUPID APP EITHER YOU FIX IT OR IM GIVING YOU A VERY BAD REVIEW LIKE every time I put my REAL email it denies it like are you game developers STUPID like seriously and then I FINALLY got it to work when it REJECTED MY USERNAME AND PASSWORD WHEN IT SAID THAT I WAS GOOD TO GO SO FIXXX IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
This is a very enjoyable game that I play whenever I have WiFi and you should to the only thing is we can’t trade like on the ds please niantic add in TRADING it would make the game so much BETTER and more people would play the wonderful game that they created 😀😀😀please put this review into consideration
Over the summer last year, I went to Chicago and I played Pokémon go. Well I caught a lot of pikachus. I came back to Alaska, and guess what.      All my things ERASED.  Don’t get this game. It’ll ruin your dreams. 
Perfect for exercising and fun too
I hate a lot that I have to go around just for some stupid Pokémon I wish y’all delete this stupid feature of having to walk for something
I’ve been paying since the game launched. I dealt with the connection issues forever. Now with the EX raid pass system I’ve battles in anywhere between 100 and 200 raids. A lot taking place at sponsored locations for the game. I still haven’t received a ex raid pass. Other players I did raids with (at the same locations) did. I’ve been robbed for the last time I just can’t bring myself to play anymore when every time I try to grind for a Mewtwo it’s all for nothing
Why would you get rid of older players who can't have iOS 11 on their phones instead of having older iOS versions supported? Then they could put the money that they would use into buying more stuff on Pokémon go.
Love the game. Hate the pay to play for raid passes and ex raid passes slacking no matter how many dozens of raids I do.   Still nothing. 
Constantly difficult to set up and then after sign up, sign in doesn't work!
Omgeeee this game stol ma mew2
Please stop making it default back to the top every time a transfer a Pokémon. I know we can select multiple ones at a time to transfer but that doesn’t allow me to check their stats 1st before I transfer. There are still many Pokémon from the 1st generation that I have never seen! Don’t spawn or hatch or have even seen them in a gym. It feels pointless to try and catch new ones when I can’t even finish off the original set. Why does it take so long to start a raid battle. The timer is useful when many people are joining but unfortunately any raid battles I join I'm always alone. Kinda defeats the whole point of a raid battle. Definitely not a fan. Irregardless I have to stand there alone waiting for the timer to end while wasting my battery. It’s just not fun to play anymore. It feels like work.
Hello, the Pokemon Bag in December changed. The bag needs to return to the previous setting. The bag currently has an issue when you are transferring pokemon it returns you back to the top of the bag. Previously, when you would transfer Pokemon the screen would return you back to where you were. Example. Transferred an evee and it would return me back to bulbasaur.
I’ve spent a good amount of money on this game but will refuse to continue to do so until they give smaller towns the chance to get EX Raids. I’ve done 300+ raids in my town of 12 gyms and have yet to get a pass here since. No point in buying premium raid passes if EX Raids are nonexistent in my town..
This game is the worst game ever because it wouldn’t let me sign in the worst game ever!!!!
FIX THE FREAKING GLITCH IN THE POKÉMON LIST TO WHERE IT RESETS TO THE TOP EVERY TIME I DO ANYTHING!! The game is fun, it has weird flaws. Why when I put my Pokémon in a GYM do they not get stronger or do anything other then collect coins? It's a gym for god sakes! Also why does a rare Pokémon spawn in a swamp in a area that closed off to the public? Also can the country folk get a little more help? Living in the city provides many opportunities but I live in the country with almost no opportunity. The scale needs to be adjusted it's unfair to single raiders, within a group catching a raid boss is ridiculous, the percentage should be higher, went to the city meet a group of people and went 0-20 on the legendary raids. The eggs are getting worse, I used to have fun hatching them, my last 7 10k eggs were all lavatar?! I walked 10k for those and you telling me I’m going to get all of the same Pokémon? I’ve goten better spawns out of my 2k eggs. 5k are also ridiculous, spawning “strong” Pokémon and the same kind I have over and over again. People are hatching awesome gym defenders and great attackers yet I haven’t even hatched a snorlax. This has made game play less fun and i noticed my self not playing as much, when I used to spend $20 every weekend to TRY and get people to do a legendary raid.
Until the game supports the PoGo+ again, 1 star (love the game but if you're going to sell a $30 accessory then it needs to be supported). It's ridiculous that the devs didn't make sure all aspects of the game work with iOS 11, even more so considering this is the second update since iOS 11 has been out. This whole game is like Pokémon amateur hour. As if Nintendo put their b-team in charge of this one.  More frustrating than fun sometimes.   Plus how long can it take to patch the scroll bug?  And don't even get me started on the broken ex raid system that favors spoofers and multi accounters.
Failed to login and The great new version has introduced over annoying Pokémon the same ones you catch every day will now eat 10-12 balls no matter the rank, color or aggression. A 68 CP Pokémon will fight at least 4 great balls with excellent throws! Even better a rare Pokémon that would take you 150 of base candy to evolve if found in wild will eat 78 Red balls, 99 great balls and 45 candy / wild berry after nearly 200 great, excellent throws he will run away no matter the ball, the amount of candy! Don't waste your time on this now useless cash grab game. I'm glad I haven't spent a penny on the over hyped game that is now nothing more then a cash grab scheme. Must be fixed!!!! Plus let’s not forget “UNABLE TO AUTHENTICATE” error
But they need to add a friend system and more pokestops in the middle of no where
I had a purple egg that took a long time to hatch. When it hatched it was a mareep. When I looked at my Pokédex file, the mareep was no where to be seen. I’m very upset with this bug.
So my data and location are always on my phone and with Pokémon go I used to be able to play in buildings and now I can’t. It will always say gps signal not found. There will be times I cannot connect to WiFi and this will happen and then I cannot play. This is right. Someone needs to fix this. I used to be able to play this game from anywhere I was using my data alone. Now half of the places I go to that I know have a lot of Pokémon I cannot play because it looses the gps signal. And I am getting very angry that I can’t play that I might just delete the game and not play at all but I love to play!! SOMEONE FIX THIS!
I’ve just downloaded the app I haven’t played since it came out in 2016 but I heard gen 3 came out and that’s my favorite generation so if any of you have any tips for me I would really appreciate it.
When I tried to register, for my password I put capitalization, numbers and symbols, and it didn’t work. I also put in my moms email correctly and it didn’t work. So if anyone knows how to fix this, then please tell me.
I love this game! Even on a rural area where I live it can still be fun. My favorite game!
I was looking at the skin colors and there was only white and beige. I don’t understand that. I think you should add brown, dark brown and black. Wait now I’m being racist. Bye.
This is the best app ever
Why has Niantic not gotten rid of ex raids? It’s done nothing but hurt the community and especially those hardcore long term players who dedicate so much time and money into the game not only for them, but also bringing the community together. Me and another local player worked to find gym which qualify for ex raids since our area has been left out since the beginning. He mapped which ones count and I organized large raids in order to trigger an ex raid. We were successful but neither one of us got a pass. So now the rest of the community that did get passes feels like they shouldn’t have them. The 2 players who worked the hardest for the group are left out. If we quit, which we're thinking of, then the entire community dies with us.
I love Pokémon go but I do wish there is more variety for your personal avatar. As a African American player, the best you can really get is an India looking avatar 😄. Though I’m not really mad or anything I would like to see in the next update a darker skinned and curlier haired character available.
Remove ex raids
I’ll keep this short so perhaps the pr peeps at Niantic will actually read. I’m level 39, nearly 40. I’ve spent hundreds of dollars on this app because I’ve really enjoyed it. I will not spend another cent, however, because EX Raid Passes have foobarred the game. I raid all the time. I even try to raid all the purported “EX gyms” in my area regularly. Still, no pass. The current system arbitrarily awards passes; no regard is given to level, raid frequency, play time, or skill. An EX pass went out to a family member who did the same raid that I did and she got a pass but I didn’t. I’m happy for her. She plays once or twice a week, is level 30, and it was her first time battling the gym; I play every day, am level 39, and I’ve battled the gym many times.   Yes, some of us are competitive players and perhaps we take it too seriously; however, a system that capriciously rewards in-game opportunities, with no regard to effort, is a crap system. Anyway, Niantic gets nothing monetary from me in the future, unless and until they fix their broken game.  In the meantime, no money for Niantic. And, btw, I’m not alone. Many of the people I see playing all over town have similar complaints.   So, Niantic, fix the game or lose players. It’s that simple. 
I have played this game regularly since release and have met a lot of great people with the introduction of raids, but after all this time so much is still broken. EX Passes are one thing, not sure if I should be bitter I still haven't gotten one or glad since they're always scheduled when most people including myself work. The nearby pokemon all regularly disappear and take 30 or more seconds to come back or god forbid you close the app before going somewhere and try and reopen it. With all the new features they're so focused on you would think they would fix that, but instead new issues are created like the scroll bug preventing you from doing maintenance in removing pokemon my friends who still do mass evolves have said it increases the time it takes to go through and evolve with a lucky egg as well. The way pokemon have been introduced leaves a lot to be desired as well. Players want PVP and Trading while Niantic releases minimal information to their players and focuses on new AR updates. Overall this app has created a few positive social experiences, but leaves a lot to be desired after well over a year.
Beginning around late December whenever I change anything within my Pokémon list it jumps to the top of the list. So if I transfer, evolve, hangs the name, power up etc it’ll jump to the top of the list and I’ll have to keep scrolling back after every change. A little thing, but very annoying.
Ex raids are a terrible thing and Niantic refuses to listen to the community and accept the giant flaming failure ex raids turned out to be. End ex raids and free Mewtwo for all.
I have an iPhone 6 and my phone location is fine but when I load my game it says no gps signal and I’m not problems with my gps on just my game any ideas on how to help?
Biggest problem with the game right now. Oh, that and the scroll bug.
So my whole family is obsessed with game and we drive around for hours trying to catch Pokémon it’s so much fun!
These two systems are fundamentally flawed. When your highest spending/highest level players are unable to receive EX passes while low mid-20s have multiple, something is wrong. This system is a cash grab that does nothing but frustrate every player who is spending money on this game, it can’t last forever until everyone figures it out.   To my 2nd point, the PoGo+ is broken on iOS11. Be it the change in the Bluetooth stack or whatever, Niantic did a horrible job of stealing my $40 for this device that barely even functions anymore as of the most recent updates. Quite the bait and switch. 
I really wish someone would do an update so you don’t have to go back to the top of the list whenever you transfer a Pokémon. This has just been happening since the last update. It hasn’t always been this way, but it’s super annoying.
We are officially told that you can increase your chances of receiving an EX Raid pass by leveling up your gym badge and doing more raids overall.   Yet what we see are everyone having to create alternate accounts (violating TOS) to receive invites on these low level accounts which have only raided at the gym once.   This is not ok. It is looking more and more like a simple cash grab, where they weight the pass distribution to those who aren't already raiding heavily to encourage them to buy more raid passes. In the process they are also ignoring those who are buying raid passes and raiding heavily because they're already making money off of these players. Not a good move, which needs to be fixed ASAP. 
KNOCKOFF OF SWEATCOIN!!! Download Sweatcoin now or u die
I love this game! 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😃😃😃😀😀😀😀😀😃😃😃😃😃😀😀😃😃😃😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
I try to play but you have to make a account but it’s impossible
Niantic has really destroyed this game. The recent update has made it harder to catch anything and hardly gives you anything at a poke stop. I’m sure you would rather me spend money in the shop and buy what I need. Please close your company down and don’t make anymore games. Leave that up to people who know what they are going.
“Unable to authenticate” will pop up about 50% of the time when I log into the app also way too boring in suburban area with poke stops and Pokémon to catch
Never had a real update game died a while ago...i played since day one spent alot of money just to grind and never got a mewtwo raid pass f this game it doesn't have a pokemon feel at all just sad ✌🏻
Whenever you transfer, rename, or favorite a Pokémon it makes you go all the way back to the top of your Pokémon list. Makes it really hard to play because my storage is filling up but it’s too hard to empty it.
Hadn’t been playing in a while and I come back to try out the game again to find I had no pokeballs at all even though I had more than 50
Game froze in the first 10 minutes. Stuck on a screen with a magnet-character and no menus.
Meh
Always jump to the top of the pokemon list after transfer a pokemon or do something like that....This is really a follish desigh....
Listen Okay Pokémon go does not work well it does but every time I put in my password and stuff I get it correct and it loads But it’s still loading! I’ve did a experiment to see if it will work I waited 2 hours and it did not work please fix
I play this game every day and I love it. In FL where I live there is always Pokémon to look for.
What trash
This game is great and I love to play it but some things could be changed. For instance when you live in a not very populated place it is hard to get the full experience of the game all you get are pidgeys and little pokestops and gyms. Another thing is I personally dislike the motivation meter in gyms and I thought it was better before. Last I would like it if it gave you an option to change teams once a game because I chose a team at the beginning of the game and didn't think it mattered and I don't want that team anymore, it is more of a personal problem but I think people would like it.
The updates are the best this game is the best everything in this game is the best it will try to find your location and  some Pokémon you can only find in particular continents
It's a fun destruction, but can't hold my interest for very long. Where are the rpg mechanics that we all loved. Just imagine if you could level up your Pokémon and have the NormalPokémon  battles. It's really just the shell of what it could have been.
Not the best game ever it can control your mind. If it controls your mind you can play on it all day long.iv you run out of poke balls you can go to the store and you have to pay money to get stuff like poke ball
Every time I transfer Pokémon, the list automatically resorts to the top of the list again. This is annoying when I’m working my way down the list to get rid of Pokémon I don’t need.
We love this game! My husband and I play every day (he’s level 36 and I’m level 35). There is a problem with the new update though. Every time you transfer a Pokémon or do anything in your Poke storage, it takes you back to the top of the screen. It’s super annoying and time consuming. It’s almost worthless to do a lucky egg and evolve because it takes so long. Please fix this!
It won’t let me sigh in w/ my google
I really like this game but If there is friendly battle with two people any where.......1vs1 to 6vs6 that would be great............ Therefore if you guys think about it and add this as new update...... Thank you. 
Not only do most rural players have very limited chances of enjoying the game but typically every person using a non GPS device with hotspot will not have fun at all!!! The range of distance that the avatar interacts with wild Pokémon, pokes tops, and gyms is too small!!! This is troublesome when your device can’t pinpoint your exact location. Hot Spotting for kids that don’t have a cellphone just results in a whiny kid that can’t catch, spin, or drop into a gym because they are across the street. Rural and suburban players don’t get any chances of catching limited release Pokémon and is extremely unfair. They also have less stops/gyms or none at all. Besides all that, the game is still boring without any PvP or random battles with a CPU characters and nemesis. Gameboy version of Pokémon is more fun.  1. Make the interaction range larger for players with poor gps signal. 2. Add a battle system where you can battle CPU characters, CPU rival/nemesis, and friends for your battling Pokémon’s candy and stardust. 3. Add a friends system so you can send daily gifts(stardust), trade(items and non-legendary Pokémon), and battle for candy and stardust. Maybe even make friends visible on the screen. 4. Make rural and suburban areas more exciting. Add pokestops, gyms, and spawn rates to be more fun for everyone. 
There are too many bad things to say, but basically this game is a mess. It's impossible to develop any strategy as the developers constantly change how the game plays. If your in a rural area forget about it. Now they are even forcing phone upgrades!  If you want to play, play but do not spend money as the game is simply not worth it.
Here why ok leave house I’m in seat beside driver I’m use data plan if there no Pokémon show in white square on bottom right were see if there a raid well it make were I can’t get pokestop or it take make progress for walking or use gym pokestop it’s like if the car moving not fast it stop showing Pokémon on bottom right and stop walking progress and can’t use gym or pokestop and if car stay one spot Pokémon start poping up in whit square but then car moving it stop I can’t use nothing can fix this
I've been seeing a l LOT of Pokémon go adds so here I go downloading it again! And you should to 
Wow I know this is for security but it just freezes so I cannot play .secondly TRADES PLEASE We neeeeeed them and you wot doo any  thing about it also  ,  there is a bug where I cannot use incenses please fix ASAP
I can't believe you're discontinuing the support for older devices. It is not fair!!!
Love the game, but it’s recently become frustrating. Every time I try to transfer or favorite a Pokémon it jumps all the way to the top of the list, and once again I have to scroll down to find the place I stopped at and start over. This is really frustrating, and I hope it can be fixed.
Can you please upgrade the item storage you add more items but not space it’s very frustrating.
I have tried many different ways to try to fix this problem with the gps error. It will occasionally work but only outside with nothing over my head. Also my character will not be moving at all when I move and be in a completely different location than I’m at.
There arent enough “new” pokemon compared to the old ones. Please fix the ratios. I only see 3 or 4 new ones a day now. Even before the event the ratio was better.
One of the most frustrating things is when you add or remove a Pokémon as a favorite it takes you back to the top of the list. This is really annoying. Please change this feature.
A big of Pokémon since it came out.
They greatly improved server stability, launched in a lot of countries, balanced pokemon attacks, improved tracking, added more character customization and renaming options, made it more difficult to transfer accidentally, fixed battery saver mode, started rotating nests... and we still have legendary events, trading, future gens, and hopefully one-on-one battles to look forward to.  Update: lack of tracking and gym stagnation is killing this game.  Update 2: tracking system is worse than when the game launched, gyms are worse than before, EX raids are retarded, limited-time legendaries encourages cheating, new medals will take years to obtain.  Update 3: Kyogre is impossible to catch. I hate Niantic. 
This game has every Pokémon there ever was!!!!!.And you can claim pokeballs and all kind of other stuff!!!! I'd rate five stars ✨! If I were you
I hate this games a it soooook bad 🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🥉🥉🥉🥉🚽🚽🚽🚽🚽❌❌❌❌📵⁉️⁉️❓❓🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵
Make it easy
Ok this game is okay but I think that the poke’ balls can be for free and in order to get coins you can sell or trades the extra Pokémon that you already have and bam you got coins.
This app is an absolute pile. It features forced interaction with complete strangers through raids is a questionable decision that parents of children who play need to screen. What masks itself as a fun romp with Pokémon becomes a thinly-veiled money making scheme that parents should avoid and teach their kids to do the same.   Too much emphasis on raids. Not only is it annoying to try to find 6-10 complete strangers to do a raid, but now I’m forced to have to play with complete strangers to complete the Pokedex which is something I and a lot of players don’t want to do.   And it’s turned into a cash grab. $1/raid. Minus the “free” one you get per day you have to pay for Pokémon that you’re not guaranteed to catch, so it’s basically gambling. On top of the, the stupid EX raid passes that you might get for completing a raid if you’re lucky is another gamble. You could do a hundred raids in a day, spending $100 in the process, and still not get an EX pass. It’s a predatory game tactic that parents should be made aware of. 
So I keep trying to play but nothing works, I keep getting a gps error no matter what I do
I put my E-mail address I triple checked if it was right and it was and it doesn't take it.
I don't want to upgrade my phone to play :(
Please fix the glitch that happens when it’s time to evolve and you tap evolve and then nothing happens. I haven’t actually seen a Pokémon evolve in my game since last fall. It’s infuriating. I would give five stars if not for that very annoying glitch.
I LOVE THIS GAME but one thing is... I can’t get the ar+ my sister already got it a year ago but I still can’t get it.Im a little disappointed that I can’t get it and I can’t figure out how to get it..😞And I need some help...
NIce play
There are no end game features to this game. It’s just a grind for xp, perfect iv pokemon and medals.   The raid system is terrible. You need 6 people to raid legendaries and often there’s not enough people. Ex-raids is a scam.   They do nothing to address cheaters. Their numbers grow because the game parameters encourages people.   Lack of communication. I’ve never witness such A death of professionalism. Their updates or events are sometimes announced a week after the fact.  They’re not knowledgeable on pokemon or their own game. They were unaware of the curve ball glitch that was out since launch with numerous articles online. It took them 1yr 4months to patch the power up glitch for lvl40 (max), then realizing that power ups is in increments of 0.5, not 1.0.   With all that said, If you use this as a workout app only, then it’s actually not bad. It does motivate some people to go out and walk. But it doesn’t make up with all of their incompetence. It really shows a lack of leadership. 
I made a new account and all it says is unable to authenticate please try again EVERY SING TIME IVE TRIED EVERYTHING THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH THE TIME EVEN TO SET UP A SIMPLE ACCOUNT   Trash game. 
My account magically disappeared. Too far to want to restart. I had event Pokémon and one day signed in to find myself signed out and when I signed back in my data was gone. Would not trust
I have iOS 11.02 and I cont catch the Pokémon
I've been playing Pokémon go since it started and I like some changes that had been made to app but the latest one when I do anything on Pokémon I get sent back up to the top of my Pokémon page and I really hate that very much. Please fix that cause I hate how that got change I don't like it one bit.
Like the game but I hate when you run out if pokeballs you have to go to poke stops because I can’t go nowhere and if I do I only get 3 pokeballs can’t you give us at least 5 pokeballs every time we run out of them
Me and my mom tried to sign in but couldn’t and we took 1hour
I wish to add Arabic language
I heard groudon and more were here and I just said I’m goin for the kill...GROUDON IS MY FAVORITE POKÉMON............so I have been having this problem with poke balls and I’m on a iPod so I can’t really walk anywhere without loosing WiFi
This game shouldn’t even be out yet, it should be in beta testing it has so many errors and bugs, it’s embarrassing. The company has no clue how to handle this game it’s way to big for them just look at GoFest it’s basically what this game is. I’ve wasted so much money in this game for level 21 accounts to get X raids passes
Fix your game please some of these new legendary Pokémon are next to impossible to catch and I’m done spending money on something that is broken do to a lack of development and just utter lazyness
This morning I had 68 poke balls and then I got off my phone for about 5 hours then I got on it again and they all disappeared
This game is my all time favorite game but it does this thing where it freezes at the intro and the only way to fix it is to delete it and download it again. If they can fix that than I’d happily give 5 stars.
No more support for non-iOS 11 devices coming soon? Just gonna fire those players?
last update changed the Pokémon menu, now when u favorite, name, evolve, or trade any Pokémon it doesn’t resume to the point in your list u were at it defaults to the top which is really annoying if you’re trying to go through top to bottom and organize or evolve, etc. really inefficient and annoying.
I like this app, it’s fun and it’s an excuse to be active but it would be amazing if they would let us trade- please make that a feature in this app
It’s been 3 weeks and they haven’t fixed the bug where if you evolve or exchange a Pokémon- it takes you back to the top of your list.   Also, I have had more freezes and crashes in the last 3 weeks than the prior 6 months combined. It freezes when catching Pokémon, when trying to exchange Pokémon and even just from clicking on a gym.  The content of the new update is neat and all, but it shouldn’t be at the expense of the gameplay... and the exchange/evolve issue is inexcusable and should have been a quick fix. 
The game is a great game. I love it. Me and a few other people occasionally go out and play together, but we have to be in town to play, so our driver has a hard time playing. Another thing, and this is just a suggestion, is making veterinarians clinics into medical areas for your pokemon, and another is trading. Like i said, though, great game in general
CANT USE POKESTOPS
I’ve been a Pokemon fan since the days of Red/Blue and hunting Pokemon in the real world was my dream come true! While catching Pokemon on my phone is still fun, Niantic really missed the mark. My hopes of hiking through forests and and traveling to remote and interesting areas in search of rare Pokemon were dashed when the game launched. Though Pokemon are loosely tied to “biomes” and now weather, you are best off going to the most densely populated part of a big city to catch rare Pokemon. Rural players and those of us who like to explore the great outdoors will be sad to find very few Pokemon outside the city.  Many who live in cities may be glad to fill their Pokédex up without leaving their neighborhood, but can be glad for little else. Over two years after launch, Niantic has still failed to introduce trading or PvP battling and gym battles are a mindless shell of what the actual games offer. Though you can nickname your Pokemon and make one your “buddy”, there is no way to interact with your Pokemon meaningfully and the game mechanics encourage players to catch hundreds of each Pokemon so you can “send them to the professor” (destroy them) for candy which levels them up and evolves them. That’s right, you can’t even level them up by battling.  In short, this is a location-based Pokemon game where neither the locations nor Pokemon really matter. If you enjoy throwing a virtual ball at many well-designed and lively virtual Pokemon in mostly random locations over and over and over, you will love this game! 
ALLOW PLAYERS TO REMOVE THEIR OWN POKÉMON FROM THE GYM.   When I make any change in to a Pokémon (favoriting or transferring) I’m kicked back to the top of the list and have to scroll down again.   Server lags all the time. Trying to sync after just going to the home screen or shutting off phone for a few minutes, I may as well just kill and restart the app because that’s faster. And I have great gps and WiFi signals and I’m on iPhone X so don’t blame the user here. 
Love the weather addition! But why no snow? I live in Indiana and this time of year...we get snow. Instead it just shows “cloudy” or “extreme”. Show the snow and the cold-loving Pokémon! ❄️🌨  I get that the point is to get people out and walking around to explore their world. But sometimes the weather doesn’t permit so I actually drag my fiancé into driving me around to pokéstops and gyms once in a while. If I’m a passenger (and have even indicated so) I should be able to spin the stops while moving. But no. ☹️ 
When is the new update going to come out.
I’ve played on my cousins iPad and I loved it so I downloaded it. I made my Pokémon account but for some reason it won’t log in so I can’t play it but it might be that I am playing on a iPhone S E. 
Any time you take an action you get sent up to the top
One of the best Pokémon games so far, with all the updates, it’s like no other Pokémon game! Keep it up.
Kids could get stolen by this game!
I kinda do t like it because it takes a day to give you the email I hope they fix this
I have to force close the app if I’m not going to play it for any period of time (saying going to have lunch or go to class), because if not, once I return to the app it takes several minutes for it to update (longer the farther away I am from the last place I played). It’s quicker to close and have it restart. Not an ideal way for the app to behave.
Love the game. Hate that with a recent update the Pokémon menu resets to the top after any change to any one or more Pokémon. Meaning if I transfer a Pokémon from the new update it does so, but then I must scroll all the way back to where I was if I wanted to stay in that area. It was not like that before and is a major problem that needs to be fixed.
This app knows where is your location😒  You might knock a person😠  You will be addicted 🙄  I hate this app😡 
Hey Niantic . I’ve seen this glitch where a picture of a trainers clothes and face. Please fix that glitch!!!!!! It scares he heck out of me! Even others! It’s very scary to see that face of the trainer ;-; Thank you if you did fix the glitch.
As a disabled veteran I wish the game had better accommodations for me. I can’t get out and walk as much as everyone else and so it’s harder to fill my Pokédex. While I do try to walk my dog daily the nearest pokestop has us walking across major streets to get to. It’s not like I can be driven there because of the stupid speed cap. Just need to get rid of the speed cap and add more pokestops so Pokémon fans have a great game.
So I love playing this game and have been with them since the beginning. Niantic has put in systems that have helped the game grow and stay in the top charts. I loved it when they added the 7 day streaks system. It gave me more XP and Stardust on a regular basis and I really needed it. I was thinking that they should add personal goals in Pokémon Go. For example, there could be daily and weekly challenges that could grant you Poké Coins, super incubators, and other bundles of items. In addition to personal goals, I believe that Niantic should scrap the EX Raids and make it so that you need to complete your own goals in order to attempt to catch Mewtwo. This way you won’t have to rely on luck as much and you don’t need to rely on other players. Another idea is that there should be a “Sell” option in he shop. Just like in the Pokémon games, you can sell items that either are worth a lot or don’t have any use for you. I have so 300+ total potions that’s I have to just discard to make more room for Poké balls. It would be awesome if I could sell the items I don’t want and receive Poké coins. It’s just a thought. I love this game so much and I hope the updates keep on rolling in!
Made an Account when the game came out, gone now. Just started a new guy, catch 1 Pokemon, and then try using every name that I ever name anything on any game and all of them were taken. Swiftly deleted. Seems like you guys might have a ton of random accounts that are just dead using up names and other data.
This is so fun and gives me courage to catch more Pokémon I can’t stop playing this
I enjoy the game, I just hate the new feature where every time I transfer a Pokémon it scrolls back to the top. What’s up with that?
I hate this game
I’ve never played game or been a fan of Pokémon but my husband started playing and wanted me to play with him so I did. I got hooked and I like this game. The only thing is that it is freezing a lot on my iPhone 7 Plus bufón his Samsung galaxy it is not freezing as much. You need to fix the game for iPhone and some stuff in the map are not right. I was standing next to a gym today to battle and it was showing that I was farther away and I couldn’t join the battle. I don’t like how it freezes when I’m catching Pokémon because I can’t catch them, even though I didn’t lose the poke balls I lost the Pokémon. Please fix this problem. Overall I like the game and this is the first time I have played a game so much!!!
I try to get set up and when I try to make my acount it doesn’t do anything it erases it and does nothing
As a level 32 mystic account Raeganomics with 700 Pokémon storage gamer from day 1 I love the game.  But my new instinct account player PogoMANNY is disappointed because it only has 300 storage and I need at least 382 without counting MEW who isn’t there yet.  You should at least expand storage to 383 for this game to attract more players if you do not want the competition beat Pokémon. I mean we all know about EA and Battlefront with their fiasco, look at the stock and their dip after the release. 
The Pokémon Go Plus does not work anymore with the OSi 11 update. This is extremely frustrating. Please fix this! Also the game is lagging since the update.
My wife an I have been playing from the start, and we love that you get to go out into the real world and see places you’d never been to before.  I’d lived in my home town for 29 years, and when Pokémon go came out I found a park (about two miles away) Id never been to. When we went to Denmark, we checked out all sorts of sites and buildings and it was FREE! It has also kept us both active. Due to our illnesses, we are supposed to walk at least an hour a day. This game gives us a great reason. Warning: As with all games, there are cheaters, and this game has some of the worst. Pokemon Go has put tons of time and effort in stopping this plague and hopefully they succeed soon, because the game they created is AMAZING! 
It is so much fun to catch these pocket monsters at real life locations and have them with you wherever you go. No other game has given me so much enjoyment.
Your stupid app WILL NOT WORK ON MAKING A ACCOUNT THIS GAME IS JUNK
Before you read all of this know that this is before the annoying company naintic decided that iOS 10 users can't play this stupid standard is going to lose tons of players who where devoted they be like just update you phone or upgrade to a newer model my response is how am I supposed to do that if I'm not over 18 and can't afford it at all if you want to buy me a phone great but until then I'm not playing I'm done no more i know complaining isn't going to change anything because naintic has listening problems but I stand for iOS 10!!! IOS 10 forever! Jul 24  I love the game it's  free fun for family's that want to have fun together or people having fun with friends raids are great I had my first one on Saturday in was a bayleaf what I like about the game now is that you can get legendarys and I'm a low level player (21) so I couldn't defeat or defend gyms so I was left behind but then they added the new gym system and I cloud take down gyms. And I have 12 gym badges they added gyms and poke stops every where even though I live on the suburban area not the urban areas great game😁😀🙂 Update I'm level 22 now currently have two Pokémon at gyms you really should play if you're going on vacation because I caught tons of new Pokémon because I went to the Rocky Mountains and there were mankeys and geodudes and sandsrew and fire types witch are not common where I live I get  bugs and water and grass pokemon not rock or fighting now I have 24 gym badges 😀  Update 11/11  What this game needs is a comm like Ingress and more events I've asked for pokestops a billion times and they say no so I've started to play Ingress both are good games but Pokémon go needs new stuff I can't wait till hp wizards unite but if you stop supporting your other games and let it die (it's not dead) than I will stop supporting you  PS  I'm level23 now  12/11/17 Sup PSS  This was the first augmented reality game other than Ingress also it's the finest one.  I have done 4 raids and I have 42 gym badges gen 3 is awesome weather update is totally legit I still play after 1 1/2 years 
At Pokémon stops you should get Pokémon coins
The new AR feature needs to be useable by all iPhones not just 6+ and above at ios11 and the purple incubated is glitching it won’t let me hatc my eggs
Love this game.  until the last update. Every time I try playing my guy gets stuck with an GPS error 11. Useless to even try to play anymore at this point. I’ve tried everything I know of. Rebooting, turning location services off/on, app refresh off/on, deleting game... etc., nada. Same problem.  I get maybe 2 minutes of play running in wrong directions, saying I’m going too fast when I’m walking, then stuck in a useless blank position with that white wheel spinning endlessly, confused and trying to refresh my gps location.  Please fix this. I’ve played Pokémon Go since it was first released and this is by far the worst bug I’ve dealt with. 
This game is great I love it and have been a huge fan of the Pokémon series since I was a child however I would like to see the introduction of pokecenters... Revives and potions are very rare to find and with how much battling I do between raids and gyms I haven’t had all my Pokémon at full health in months
MORE BAG SPACE
It’s turned into a money hole and when your an original top 1000 lvl forty people can get their without spending money. I wasted 4000$ to be good in the game and people being able to level fast and take away from the curve of the game made it broken unfair waste of money and all the go feats have been scams
Every time I transfer Pokémon to evolve and to power up, I get frustrated that the list of my collecting always goes back to the top of the list instead of staying where I am (like it did before) scrolling all the way back down to the Pokémon I was working on is frustrating. I have 600 Pokémon to work with it's a pain. Other than that it's fun to play!
One of my favorite game and spent a lot of my money and time . Deserve 0 star because the Ex-raid pass. System is broken. We know Mewtwo hard to get but there should be a definite describe a way to get a chance of getting Mewtwo. Not saying do more battles and spend more money and will give you one but unfortunately many friends I know they got and they have like 5 to 10 battles. I am level 39 and no ex-pass. Stop Niantic and Fix this problem.
Fix the EX system !!!
DISHONEST TO REMOVE support for devices  that do not support IOS 11 . This is unacceptable and unbelievable . Basically blocking players who have played the game for a couple years and removing their progress . Absolutely ridiculous , to BLOCK players unless they $500-$1000 to play this game is downright JOKE . Devices only couple years old blocked from playing on PURPOSE TO INCREASE PHONE SALES , ABSOLUTELY UPSURD BUSINESS MODEL. People should request MILLIONS IN REFUNDS  FOR DELIBERATELY REMOVING SUPPORT FOR DEVICES , EVEN THOUGH THE DEVICES ARE FULLY  ABLE TO RUN THE GAME WITHOUT A PROBLEM....
Title says it all.
One of the most frustrating things with the new Pokémon update is when you transfer a Pokémon and it automatically goes back to the top of the Pokémon list. Then you have to scroll back down to where you left off, please fix!  Otherwise I love the new weather feature even if it’s not 100% accurate and the new Pokémon that are available to catch.
i always lose interest after awhile because even after all the updates the rural/older/solo players aren’t being listened to.
Great game, fun to play, met a bunch of cool people playing it.    Ex Raid feature is the worst thing ever.  Alienates hardcore player base, ambiguous criteria to qualify.  The results don’t line up with what they say criteria is.  It is also completely unnecessary. 
I love this game because I grew up with the originals on GameBoy, etc., but I had much higher hopes for this platform! Of course, things will constantly change and update, but there are so many little issues throughout and the updates aren’t fast enough to fix them. For example, the current bug is that when you transfer/evolve Pokémon, it shoots you straight back to the top of your Pokémon list instead of staying where you are. This makes the whole process so slow and clumsy, and this issue has persisted for weeks. I’d love to see better prizes/items, more Pokémon, and quicker Issue service, but I understand that all of that comes with time. I’m a patient player though, so I’ll continue to play happily anyway!
I have been a player since month 1 and regularly enjoy the search for Pokémon, raid battles and game strategy.  There is a sense of community that builds when you join a group of strangers to battle at a gym. Walking around to get the benefits feels healthier than most “sit around” gaming.  The but:  the latest version resets the scroll bar to the top after every action. So very frustrating when you have 50 Pokémon to evolve and you put on a magic egg to get the double points but each evolve scrolls back to the top taking much longer to scroll down the list to figure out where you were before.  It was not like this before but each new release brings some good things along with some bugs we just live with for awhile. The bigger BUT is that we can no longer give this feedback to develops for a timely fix.  I will still play the game because it’s an active thing we do as a family but pray develops figure out they made this much less user friendly and much more frustrating.
Happy to report that the game is now fixed with ios11. Up until December 2017 an issue had appeared with upgrading to ios11 where Pokémon go plus went down to 1% functional of its intended use. That issue is now fixed.  I’ve been playing it every day since day 2 that it came out. Very happy with the game and like that Ninantic  is responsive to issues like this. 
#Expassbroken#coinfreeze
Was such a fun and promising game but from a crap developer that does nothing but LIE to their customers.  The ex pass system is ridiculous.  Legendary Pokémon and Mewtwo should have to be earned yet low level players keep getting these passes from doing 1 raid at a gym when high level players who have high level badges and raid frequently are being left out.  They set a list of requirements but as data shows they don’t use this criteria at all.  They also have yet to find a way to combat spoofers who are dominating the gym system and spoofing into sponsored gyms and getting ex-raid passes from others that have earned this right by playing legitimately.  Report this activity and still nothing is done.  Give the game back to Nintendo
0 stars for breaking the app so you can’t do an evolve session properly. Every evolve or name change scrolls you back to the top. Patiently waiting to evolve all my new Gen 3 and it’s been nearly a month without a fix. RUDE.
Please fix the ex-raid pass system for obtaining Mewtwo. It has been incredibly infuriating for players for months, the unpopularity has been well known, yet Niantic insists on keeping the broken system. The current format encourages everyone to break terms of service. To get a pass for these exclusive raids many players have resorted to a practice called spoofing, where they cheat by trucking their GPS so the game thinks they’re in a different location. People now spoof to raid at as many sponsored gyms as possible for Mewtwo. Because the number of ex-passes is limited, more popular sponsored gym locations just end up having spoofers take all the passes from the honest players. To increase odds for Mewtwo many people are also creating more and more individual accounts, and people now share accounts to be able to make raids at a set time and place. These last 2 practices are also against teens of service, but many find it necessary in this broken system. Possible suggestions for a fix:  1. Remove the ex-pass system entirely, and have a Mewtwo wave like other legendaries.  2. If ex pass system is to remain in place, stop limiting the number of passes handed out at a raid to 40. Currently spoofers get the vast majority of all the passes, which is frustrating for people who go out in person.  3. Have ex-passes drop like TMs from raids (ok if it’s rare), and ex raids appear more commonly.  In the meantime many ‘whales’ (players who have spent hundreds of dollars on the game) are quitting or losing interesting in spending money on a system so frustrating. A fix would return interest in the game. 
Tired of seeing the same people INCLUDING spoofers get the ex pass when some dedicated players get the bad end of the stick. Seriously tired of seeing others around me get invites only to open my app and find nothing
When are pokepuffs gonna be added
Niantic simply doesn't care about it's players base. The Ex Raid system is completely broke. They say you have a better chance based on how many raids you've done, if the gym is gold and if you raid in parks/sponsored gyms. When in fact the vast majority of people that get passes are people that barely play at all. Niantic needs to get their crap together before their biggest customers flat out quit. You think by now they would know how to manage a game properly and at least have some sort of customer service that isn't a copy and paste reply.
Now don’t get me wrong I’m not saying add more Pokémon, but I am saying let players catch Pokémon without having to go to DANGEROUS, RANDOM, AND FAR PLACES. Just please let players catch Pokémon MORE EASIER! Other than that pretty good game.👌
Enough said
FIX THE EX RAID SYSTEM.
There are a lot of things that need to change. They have made so much money, there is little room for excuses as to why things haven’t been fixed (mainly the EX system).
I defended a gym for 3 days and guess what I got 5 coins .and for a day it’s like 50-100 I don’t get it and when the pokestop is in my circle and I spin it says try again even though it is right next to me or in my circle
The game is fun, but more serious players are getting hosed by the current EX pass system. It’s starting to make serious players consider quitting, and refuse to spend money on the game.
I love this game and I’ve spent a lot of money; yet an EX pass eludes me. The system is broken and terrible. Yes Mewtwo should be hard to get - but there should be a definite, proscribed way to gain a chance of catching Mewtwo. As of now there is not, and the info we’ve been provided about how to get an EX invite seems to be faulty. Too many people have tried everything and not gotten a pass. Too many low level casual players get passes when hardcore higher level players get passed up. Fix this. NOW.
This game has the potential to be amazing, but the current design punishes you for playing.  The more you play, the less likely you are to be rewarded.  The Ex pass system is broken, and so far there is no signs of it being fixed.  Save yourself the time and money, stick to the Nintendo versions.
The app needs to have a transparent system for ex raids.
It would be a lot easier to sort Pokémon by their generation, especially when trying to do a lot of consecutive evolutions. It is quite time consuming to keep scrolling through all the way down to gen 3.
By far the worst judgement on choosing who gets ex passes
Please fix your ex raid system, there are trainers with 2k+ leg raids done and they haven't received a single ex raid pass!
I was trying to catch a starter and it wasn’t working and i even searched and did what it said and IT STILL WOULDNT WORK!!!!!
It’s not calculating what I catch for my medal challenges. For example, we caught 5 rats today and my number out of 50 is staying the same. Also, when I’m done transferring it jumps me back to the top and I have to scroll back down.
Is unfair and broken.
I notice my avatar hasn’t moved lately. I travel through out my district and I never had this problem. So now it causes an issue where my charmander can’t gain any candy for being a walking “buddy” please help! I enjoy this game and i want to continue to reach each level and earn more badges! But can’t if my avatar won’t move while I’m moving.
EX RAIDS and gym battles must be fixed in order for the game to progress. Pokemon status and abilities must be added as well. Not enough updates were made quickly and caused people to quit and lose interest.
Ok so I absolutely love this app, but I dislike how long it takes to transfer Pokémon. This is because of a major problem where whenever you are transferring Pokémon, it jumps back to the top of the list after every transfer. This then leads to having to go all the way back through your Pokémon every time you transfer one. Please fix this problem. It would be much appreciated!
Poor communication regarding updates, how to achieve certain goals (ex raids). Could be a great game but it’s poorly ran and operated.
I have been playing this game from day 1. I still play but not to the same extent. My 2 biggest issues are that there are no longer spawns in Kailua, HI but still many, many gyms and poke stops. The only way we can catch Diane’s is if we use a lure or incense (which of course we pay for).   Secondly, even though I raid consistently at sponsored spots, parks and other areas, I have yet to receive an ex Raid pass. I know people who spoof and cheat and play for ‘friends’ who receive raid passes. It’s disappointing and frustrating. 
I wanted to play this game and I went inside the app and it did not work. It put me back to level 1!! Don't get it!! I deleted it FOREVER!! Even though I used to like it.
They are horrible about addressing concerns in the game and communication between them and this community are non-existent.
While it was short-lived, I had a BLAST playing this with several family members and friends. Getting out and running around to chase down Pokémon used to be a date night and my wife and I.
Some of my places where I caught does not show up.  Android shows all places the Pokémon where they were caught. For me Buenos Aires and Okinawa does not show up.
People that hardly play this game are getting EX raid passes while people more dedicated and more active are not receiving them. The system is flawed.
The ex raid system needs to go. The company is constantly lying about how they are distributing them but it is pure blind luck! Their should be clear ways to obtain them instead of a lottery. I’ve spent over a thousand of dollars playing this game since launch but will not spend another dime until change is made.
I’ve played this game since day one and I obviously love it. BUT when I did the last update, every time I transfer or evolve a mon the screen pops back to the top of The Pokémon list of mons. This is extremely aggravating and I’m surprised it has not been fixed after 3 weeks! Come on guys. Ur better than this!
While on paper, EX raids don’t sound like a bad idea. In real life though, they are a complete failure. I haven’t heard anyone say that EX raids were a good thing. The way they’re given out now is horrible. Complete randomness with a slightly higher chance of them appearing at a sponsored gym.
Game is too restrictive. GPS on game work is always dropping out.  Games really going down hill fast. Changes are not making the game better, worse, if it wasn’t for Legendary this game most like would be OVER.
Raids are impossible and unfair in rural communities and the elusive EX Pass system is beyond broken. Unless raid difficulty becomes scaleable to number of raid participants so that rural players have a chance of beating a L4/5 raid with just 3-4 players this game is unplayable for me. Money down the drain. I won’t be spending another $ on in game purchases.
Rework your ex raid pass and make it fair especially to those that fund this game!
The ex raid system is trash and needs to be overhauled you guys also need to increase the catch & stop cap people are hitting it way to easy especially when you guys have events that increase spawns / 6 hour lures, you guys really need to listen to your fan base that is supporting your company!
Fix the EX raid system
Once that gets fixed and you stop awarding spoofers passes and give them to players who are loyal to your game and play it the way it should be played, I can change my rating. This is a huge problem with the app as it is now especially if you plan to introduce more mons to the game this way.
The game is great. On the next update, you guys should put a certain color “dot” next to Pokémon that are ready to be evolved. It would let us know they’re ready instead of going in and out of Pokémon selection screens to see if they’re ready to evolve. Would kill a lot of wasted time. Thanks!
I wish you guys could incorporate a way to change to sound in game than changing the phones volume.  I don’t like having to turn down the phones volume and than forgetting to turn it back up to be able to hear the phone ring.  You guys did it for Ingress please do it for Pokémon Go as well.
There are still a lot of bugs in Pokemon Go & since I play this game daily it is very frustrating. I have sent numerous requests for support but Niantic is very unresponsive. I will be playing and parts of my screen become unresponsive. This is a software issue. Many times the only was to catch Pokémon again is to force quit the app & reopen it. This has been so frustrating I will probably have to quit this game although I have been an avid player. If any other players have had this problem please post a review on iTunes. Maybe if enough players complain, Niantic might respond. I really hope so.
Lemme first start with I love Pokémon a little more than a grown adult should. But honestly this game isn’t made for everyone- by that I mean it’s way more interactive for those who live in-town or in bustling cities. If you live 10 to 20 minutes from your nearest town there’s nothing you can catch that is new for the player. The most common Pokémon appear ( if they appear) out in the middle of nowhere. To add to it, zero-one pokestops around our 10-20 mile radius whereas in-town quite the opposite. Its a waste of an app for those who live in Rural areas and they should specify that to people who are new to the game. Come on Niantics and Pokémon- you’ve got all this money and this is what we’re doing for fans?
Hello, I just returned after being gone for nearly a year. I’ve only had 1 account set up, but now after logging back in I’m level 5 and all my pokemon are missing. I was level 20 before I left! Has this happened to anyone else? I sent a request to Niantic to review but wanted to check with you guys. Thanks!
I love the game but sometimes I can’t even log in, so how am I supposed to play the game . Pleas fix this and I’ll give it 5 stars
This is probably my favorite game! I love all the Pokémon and raids! I have like 156 Pokémon! I like how you can do gym battles and take over gyms and put your Pokémon in to get coins! I can’t wait for the kanto region update!!! I think you all should get the game!! Best game ever!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!!                                     By Tankdroid 
Great game, but could definitely improve. For example, have more opportunities for raids, allow more than 50 coins per day, put in trading. Etc. all things I assume will happen.
I like the game, though today I bought $1 worth of Pokeballs ( 20 ). I know $1 isn’t that much, but still I never got 1 Pokeball. It is very unfair and should be fixed immediately. You are ripping me off and stealing my money! Please see this,  Emilie. 
I deleted some spare Pokémon and then I lost all my pokeballs!!!  Rip off!!!
I have several concerns.  1.  The idea of limiting one character of its kind to a gym really doesn't make sense. Having all of them different really makes all gyms the same.   What was wrong with that?   Now every gym now has a Snorlax, Dragonite, Vaporeon, etc.    2.   There is no more point to increasing the CP of your Pokémon.   If it always takes 3 battles to knock out a player, it doesn’t matter the level of CP.   This has ruined the strategy.  3.  When are you going to fix the scroll issue?  Every time when you transfer a Pokemon it brings you back to the top of your list.   This makes evolving characters highly difficult and frustrating.  Can you fix this please?!? 
Game is unplayable in any area where you play with others, gyms, raids etc. The cheaters have multiple max level  accounts, perfect rare Pokémon, and unlimited resources. These guys have dozens of mewtwos, where many normal players haven’t yet seen an invite to fight for one.  Reports of cheating are completely ignored by niantic, despite clear proof. Don’t start, you can’t win. 
I was playing the game  and had to turn my phone off because of work and this game acts like I have no account twice now and it has ripped me off over 100 dollars in haveing to buy poke balls and items it keeps resetting and all my items and Pokemon are all deleted and it starts all over again it is very frustrating and I have no idea why it is doing this to me
I hate that they are make nag Stardust harder and harder to get!!! I have plenty of candy, but I can’t get enough stardust... it’s ridiculous, I’m at level 20 with a tiny 900 cp Pokémon!!!
My brother almost got ran over playing this this game is dangerous and can track down your houses
It's finally raining in Southern California!!! But my app says it's cloudy, beyond bummed by this. Where is Niantic getting their weather info from cause it's way off?
It seems like Niantic has had a lot of bad practices when developing this game. First off, error 29. Really? Your solution to fix it is to just walk away for 10 minutes and then it fixes itself? Really? And the next is error 25. Really? Why can’t the game remove Pokémon from the screen that already have been caught or have been de-spawned? Just remove it from he screen immediately once the Pokémon is gone! The game is fine I guess. Just a glorified collecting app. It’s very unfulfilling and the game really only starts to pick up when you hit level 30, and that takes a while.
YOU ARE HOPELESS MONEY HUNGRY PIECES OF CRAP. TAKE AND TAKE AND GIVE LESS AND LESS.REFUSE TO LISTEN TO CUSTOMERS. I WILL NEVER PLAY ANY NIANTIC RELATED GAME EVER AGAIN
Very annoyed with how every time i transfer a Pokémon it goes to the top of my Pokédex. Please fix
Do people really get kidnapped by this game?? Cause my mom said so and I’m scared and deleted the game.
It won’t let me sign in and I have registered
Just upgraded to iOS 11, and man does this thing like to drain my battery! No joke, I went from 68% to 40% in less than five minutes. Not sure if this is the developers’ issue or the new iOS that’s doing it, but it seems to be the only troublemaker on my phone for my battery.
I would like the option to battle other people and maybe be able to develop movesets instead of tapping for battling! Finding tms would be fun!! And I think we should take advantage of being able to trade Pokémon without the wires like how we had to with the gameboy games!! I love the game, it’s definitely addicting and deserves five stars!!
I would love to have a raid or gym in my neighborhood. I have a park that has been there for a while in my friends neighborhood. Homestead pebble brook community. We always had to run for miles just to get to a pokestop. Now it’s in thought that if we did have a gym or pokestop there. I would love for this to happen in future communities. If you see this “Niantic” company please do it my 23 friends that play Pokémon go depend on you please
Why is it that every time I trade a Pokémon in my list or star a Pokémon it scrolls all the way back up to the top of my list!? It’s a pain to have to go all the way down to where I was to continue my starring or trading.  Please fix this!
Fun!
I love this game when I played it on my friends phone but it won't let me download it on my phone because it's older!☹️☹️
Every time I favorite or transfer a Pokémon it takes me back to the top. Please fix this glitch because it is very annoying
Fun game but I last everything so stupid
I love Pokemon Go and I play it quite a bit. I also happen to be a runner for my school who logs 35+ miles a week in runs not to mention steps. The problem it isn't viable to take my phone with me during my runs. I could be hatching eggs and earning candies like crazy, but there is no way for my phone to know that. I think a system where you can sync the app with other apps like the Garmin app I use for my steps/runs or Strava or Fitbit to import steps would greatly help boost the games appeal and help struggling players. Thank you for reading this and thank you for the app.
No offense but I can't play this game whatsoever because I can't sign in and a friend told me to keep downloading it till the game says to sign in to google.
I CANNOT SIGN IN WITH GOOGLE AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I used to love this game but I live on the east coast, where we have like 6 months of super freezing weather and a lot of rain. It used to be a lot of fun on long trips, in bad weather, or at night to play this in the car. Now you can’t even get poke stops and zero Pokémon will appear if you’re in a car going more than like 15mph. I get you don’t want people driving and playing, which is fine you say that several times in app, but what about passengers and people in the back? It’s making it almost unplayable for me and a lot of my friends a lot of the time.
The is just a stupid game get rid of it
I’ve completed more than 650 raids. Gyms at my local parks are gold. I still haven’t received an ex pass. Contacted Niantic and they told me to make sure I did lots of raids at parks and that the gyms were gold.
Too bad I don’t know anyone who plays this anymore. It was a really cool fad that my son and I out walking a lot. No one around here plays anymore 😟
the legendary raids are lame, that is all.
Overall I'm loving the changes in the latest update. The button for charged attacks really improves battling, and I absolutely love the weather feature.   The annoying thing is that any time you make a change to a Pokemon in your box (rename, evolve, transfer), it shoots back to the top of the list which really bogs down the game. I don't know if this is exclusive to iPhone X, or if all phones experience it, but I hope this can get fixed soon. Love the app otherwise. 
I love this game!As of now, it is currently up to hoenne. It has so many pokemon to catch.The only problem is it's so early in development. I can't wait for it to be a full game so I can review again.
I had several Pokémon in gyms for over 24 hours, and received no coins when they returned to me. Is this a new glitch, or am I missing something?
I had no issues playing this till it logged me out and I can’t get back in even though I have the email I used and I tried resetting the password...I have so many Pokémon and eggs and basically if I can’t fix this I’m deleting the app. So annoying. Its also telling me I never signed up to the Pokémon club using my email but I literally have an email from the Pokémon club website saying my username and stuff.
Good game gotta admit it, but can you do something about the players that lives on small island with not very much players but looking forward to experience and enjoy the full capacity of the game.  Its almost impossible for us players located in small areas where i lived to actually experience raiding and catching  a  raid boss... why? numbers of players playing, please understand that not all people live in big cities where there is a lot of players everywhere... i sure hope that you will do something about it.. like the raid boss’ cp will depend on how many challenger maybe? and please do something about the spawn rate, i mean like lower 48’s states spawn rate is not compare to small places specially remote island whre i live! i mean it takes 10 minutes drive for us here to encounter 3-5 pokemon... but  in big states? they dont even have to try to encounter 15 pokemons! please do something about these issues... We just want to experience what players in big cities does. Thank you!
I keep getting gps errors messages constantly and am unable to play
Do not get or delete if already have 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡😡😡
I hate the trainers club register
Every time I go into the app it would say no gps signal found, I would wait at least 5 minutes and still the same thing. I go on this app everyday and it started happening after the last update. PLEASE FIX.
This game is ridiculous and a waste of time I got banned and they are banning random accounts
I was wondering when that great Gen 3 spawn rate would turn into weather boosted weedles. Smart move though, I’m sure many will be out in that 7° weather catching caterpies!!
My friend has this game and so do I. I have an Apple and my friend has a Samsung Phone. On my friend’s phone the location is on(same place as me) but WiFi is off(unlimited internet) and her trainer is at our location. On my phone, my location is on and WiFi is off(unlimited internet) and my trainer is not at our location. This is a bust because we both are on Valor and want to beat/add in gyms and collect pokestops. This is hard for me because my trainer isn’t even near the gym/stop, but my friend is right at it. I want this fixed because I can’t do much if my trainer isn’t near the gyms/stops.  So can u guys plz fix this bug and I’ll GLADLY give this review 5 stars🙂
Would be a five star if we had more updates dealing with the Pokémon’s n new stuff everytime a update comes out along with team work party/battles but other than that it’s a great game just wish you could see actual active ppl walking around you when they are on Pokémon go and we can interact with them along with sharing or trading Items along with cooperation on a raid or team battles
I love this game but I hate that it takes you to the top of the menu whenever you transfer or favorite a Pokémon.
This stupid app is always getting to many errors and it crashes every time I try to play it and it still has a bug problem and I am sick of it I going start to sue this app and it doesn’t even tell me how to train my Pokémon plus it freezes all the time
Gen 3 is amazing and I absolutely love the weather boosting effects. I‎t really makes raiding and hunting ‘mons fun again. I’ve been playing Pokémon Go since day 1 and while it’s been almost 2 years since the game came out, there’s still major features that need to be added that so many would like to see.   I know it’s beating a dead horse but trading and PVP need to come in the game to make i‎t feel like one of the more mainstream games. Also the rest of the shiny Pokémon should be released because it gives people a reason to keep catching more common ‘mons, and more Gen 3 ‘mons should be put into Raid bosses.   Lastly rural players need to have some sort of fix. Niantic, you did say you’d have a fix for them by the end of the summer in 2017 and that never happened. Even as a suburban player, I don’t get nearly as good spawns as the cities. Better balancing is a must if this game is ever going to make a comeback or maintain its current base. I think a major balancing update could be game changing for everyone and really bring Pokémon go back into the spotlight.   Please take this into consideration. Long live Pokémon Go! 
It’s starting to get boring and annoying that all you can do is catch Pokémon or run from them and then having to transfer them if you don’t want it. It would be great and more fun if you could actually battle wild Pokémon with the pokemon you already have. I’m thinking about just going back to playing only Pokémon on all the versions of the game boy than this
Seems like original gen Pokémon will not spawn for me ever! I have one pokestop near me and that’s it.... all I want is charizard or blastoise and that is exactly what I can never find! Why not make a graphic for certain typed nests on the gps screen, like that would show players where to go to catch certain types because the new weather element doesn’t really reflect what Pokémon should be popping up.
Finally no one plays this stupid game! And to the adults; please just stop... You all are so pathetic and it’s very sad. STOP
It’s not even letting me log in it is so old
I LOVE POKÉMON GO!!! I only wish we would get the different generations faster. And maybe some more special Pikachu. If we got Surfing Pikachu and Flying Pikachu I would love it. But aside from that, the game is awesome and I look forward to seeing more of my favorite Pokémon in Pokémon Go!
Pokémon is a highly liked franchise in my family but this game really takes away from family time. Really makes you look bad when your whole families on there phones running around eyes glued to the screen.
Been playing non stop sense first day I installed app!! Trading / pvp battles would make this #1 app pls continue to keep this app great
Not sure exactly what the developers at Niantic actually do, but having to put up with the glitch of the screen going back to the top of your Pokémon list every time you do anything for even a few hours is annoying. Weeks?  Unacceptable. Other games would have this fixed immediately. Very sad.
Pokémon GO has been a blast, but it would be so much better if it had online battles and it could help train players to battle in a raid, instead of just rushing in and not knowing what to do. You should also make it available to trade items, such as Poké Balls or potions.
Even if it’s not actively snowing, If I’m trudging out in the cold, boost some ice types!  When it’s night, or in a thunderstorm, dark types should also be boosted. I’m surprised they’re not! Also, ghost types should get a night boost. Psychic could be boosted around dawn, and fairy types around sunset (instead of cloudy, even, since that seems random).  And sure, I know you say it’s a “weather” feature, but your little icon has a sun or a moon in it depending on the time of day, and the app shifts to being dark at night, so it seems like the time of day as it relates to the sun should matter.  Also, it’s often really hard to see the status bar because it never turns white. Especially when the sky turns dark, it’s quite hard to see what time it is or how your battery is, for example. Ever since the game came out I assumed this obvious irritation would be fixed, but it never has been. 
App would not open at all. Please fix. Try to play without WiFi and app would not open. Stays at the Christmas tree scene. Nothing wrong with my phone or carrier
I used to love this game it was so fun but now all of a sudden my guy doesn’t walk and I can’t enjoy the game so if you download this game you have a high chance that your guy or girl will not move or walk as I should say.But other then that game is good if your person walks and doesn’t stay in one place.
When I saw this game before I got a phone, I thought it would be a good game. I liked Pokémon, too. When I finally got a phone, I got the app and made an account. After that I tried logging in and it keeps loading. I just wanted to play the game. Tried reinstalling the game, restarting my phone, nothing worked.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!! I hate how many Pokémon are underrated and cp cap is lower then others for example Starmie & Dewgong...Pls allow us to level and increase the cp to any Pokémon like charmander, to enjoy the pokemongo app like the early Pokémon games or just don’t underrate fully evolved Pokémon.  Also, allow us to change TEAM at least once. If possible allow people to BUY EX-RAID PASS so at least we get a shot at MEWTWO vs random select people who raid at the right time/right place.
I love pokemon go but i run into too many problems with location or no GPS found.  My location setting is on and running always for the app but still having issues.  This needs to be fixed.
It was ok until I loaded my Pokémon go and it wouldn’t move fix this
With the recent update, every time I transfer a Pokémon, the list jumps back to the start. Who in the right mind will design the game this way!!! Please change it back!
I love this app so much!!thow you actually have to go on the roads it is still very fun!!! And I also like playing with my dad BTW nerdy me🤓we’ll let me say it is a great app and who ever is reading this.GET IT NOW IM SERIOUS YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOU MISSING GET IT NOW!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It’s an overall great game but it still lacks very desirable features such as trading and pvp
The only thing that can make this thing better is leaderboards. So you can see where you stand locally and globally. To do this just add all of the CP of their top 6
You say that raiding in parks can get you a invite, this is proven to be not true. In Brecksville Ohio almost every gym Is a park gym and nobody in the group has ever got a invite in Brecksville. Ex raids should be improved or get rid of them.
I’ve been playing Pokémon since it’s original release for over 20 years I love this game too but I wish there was more Pokémon in the country areas
Slower load screen  When viewing/favoriting or sending Pokémon to the professor screen jumps back to the top of list which is frustrating if I am trying to evolve a Pokémon 
So I’ve had to log in about 10 different times on the same account. Idk why it keeps signing out. Please fix.
I like the games and the art style but the bad thing is It makes Pokémon hard to catch! The more Pokémon you have the harder it is to catch them
This is definitely a great game overall, and I’m really excited for Unova Pokémon to arrive, but I do not like two things.   1) Raid battles- I think raid battles are an awesome idea but I will walk all the way to the gym and nobody is ever there. I don’t know how that is fixable  2)Pokéballs in the shop- I am constantly running out of pokéballs and it is really annoying. So I put my Pokémon in a gym, to gain more coins, but after two days of waiting, I only got 50 Pokécoins. (Which isn’t enough to buy anything) So I had to do it again. After that, I bought twenty pokéballs which were gone in half an hour. I think you should get pokécoins while your Pokémon is in the gym and you should get more of them. Or get 40 pokéballs for 100 pokécoins.   Thank you for reading 
The game is fun. The newest generation of Pokémon are fun. The raids are fun. I play every day. 👍 BUT the fact that evolving or transferring a Pokémon jumps the scroll position all the way back up to the top means that when I use a lucky egg to evolve things, I lose quite a bit of time scrolling back to where I was. I thought this glitch would be fixed promptly, but it’s been a surprisingly long time. 👎 I will definitely keep playing, but I REALLY HOPE that an update happens soon that fixes this issue. Thanks for constantly working on improvements. 🙂
It’s old and it’s not a trend anymore so nobody plays it anymore so it stinks nobody plays cuz there’s groups or gangs and I can’t find any but still awesome game just not much people play this anymore
ONE OF THE BEST APPS!!!!
Why does ar+ only work for iPhone 6s software because I am mad because I don’t have that software uhhh
I love this game but pleaseeee fix the bug that forces you to scroll back up to the top of your Pokémon box after transferring a Pokémon. It’s so frustrating and makes evolving during a lucky egg very difficult. Thanks for all you do!!
I love this game so much mostly with the new update but I feel like there should more hair styles and add body shapes this is a problem that I've been dealing with ever since gen 2 came out I was fine with this but I gets boring to see each trainer with the same characteristics as you I highly want this update so please and thank you😁.
I’ve been playing this for some time. Although this is just a though, I have a question, that I’m sure others would think is a good idea as well.  I think, a good way to level up individual Pokemon, would be having an Option, to use a said Pokemon, while in the catching mode. So, similar like the original games, you may start off with how it is now with a wild encounter, and maybe a button that you choose which Pokémon you could use to fight gaining more Pokémon do for that specific Pokémon since some like myself, are focusing on 6. Also, Places round players where they could heal.   Maybe even being able to see work with other players. That would be cool.  Update :Now, one thing,  That I have a big problem with is i just lost a f-in raid pass because I got an ERROR message while trying to do a raid. I’m aggravated due to these errors. I enjoy the game, by far but this has upset me. I tried getting a Groudon but couldn’t. Not one ball turn and he popped out not even a second in there. I’m starting to loose interest in this game because of these types of games. And I bet you developers won’t even give me my raid pass back. You guys don’t care.  Not trying to be rude, so apologies in advance. But it would be cool for maybe a moment or two, too compensate for players like myself because of errors on your behalf. 
I play everyday, and it shouldn’t take all day to evolve, or transfer 20 Pokémon. Please fix this. Also, sell everything individually. I, like most people only want the super incubators. Making the boxes useless
Love the game really enjoy playing it with my nephew, I do have a few ideas hope you guys see it 1- to have like a candy given if we battle and win we get a candy of that Pokémon. 2- give an option for the eggs that if we are on the car we can switch it to a longer distance I do a lot of family road trips and would like to be able to hatch the eggs faster. (Obviously this would be good if somehow you guys can monitor that the player isn’t driving) Those are my 2 suggestions hope to see the next improvements to the game 
So Pokémon go I think is the best game enyone has ever made or one of the best Pokémon games I’ve ever played but one tip or recommendation I have is that,when it snows more ice or snow Pokémon should come out and I think that you should make it that it looks like theirs little snow flacks comming from the sky and that the ground should be covered with snow
MAKE AN UPDATE SO THAT WE CAN BUY MOVES JUST LIKE IN THE GAME. Make it happen or else. Those Ex raid invites are dumb, why send to a few and not everyone? It’s like saying only those you choose are worthy of a Mewtwo. I remember when you guys were number one on the app/google store but look at you all the way down on 75 
Can we fix the glitch that pops you back up to the top of your Pokémon box every time you transfer a Pokémon?
I went through all the sign in proceedings and then the game didn't even load. Only giving this 5 stars do it might get seen.
I used to like this game. They send out all these updates for "bug fixes" but nothibg is fixed. Despite having perfect service, no poke stops work. They all say try again. Close the app, still does not work. Can't really do anything without balls to catch the Pokémon. Finally deleted it.
Why are professor transfers and evolutions bringing you back to the top of your list instead of returning to where you were working?
Every time it snows or rains it won’t show up right in my game it only worked once. one time it snowed, my game had rain with snow falling through it. another time no snow just wind. now theres a freaking blizzard outside my house and my game has wind with snow flakes falling but no snow on the ground. I also notice it will be windy in my game when its raining outside. Whatever weather service you guys are using to support this feature, its not working sorry
Love this game I play every single day. One issue that is really grinding my gears though is that now, after the latest update when you transfer a Pokémon to the trainer and it’s successful it takes you back to the top of your Pokémon list instead of leaving you where you were. So transferring a Mudkip to get candy to evolve and once it’s done and accepted it takes me all the way back to letter A instead of leaving me in the M’s. Very time consuming and extremely frustrating. But I still play, it’s just annoying.
The raid battles need to be changed where people can battle everything by themselves because kids and other people keep getting bullied out of raids by Facebook groups of which you are allowing these internet Facebook freaks run everything. Every time I go to raid, I witness kids being bullied from ex raid battles and regular raid battles and I may not be a kid, but even I’m being bullied out of them all because of some Facebook freak group that only lets its members play! Also add trading pvp and make it where you can battle the wild Pokémon like you do in the video game!
Active player since launch and still no EX-raid pass.
Pikachu’s Butt is cute 🍑
Catching, battling, and playing with friends is fun. Makes you go outside. BBBUUUUTTT, rural players such as me get screwed. There are less pokestops and less Pokémon because they base spawns off of cell usage. It is also impossible to defeat legendary raid bosses in rural areas. Not enough people. Maybe in rural areas bring down the cp of them? Or put legendaries in the wild?
This game is so fun to play I all most play it everyday because it so fun to play one thing is I wish the trading was here but I know you are working hard to get a good game and it is a great game to go out side and play so this game I great to play well bye!!!
When I was doing a raid on a maul while I knocked out the raid boss and then the time ran out. I should have then been able to capture the boss but it kicked me out and said times up. This is a very frustrating glitch plz fix.
PLEASE FIX THE LIST SO THAT IT NO LONGER TAKES YOU BACK TO THE TOP AFTER TRANSFERRING EACH POKÉMON. THIS IS SUPER ANNOYING!!!
I live in a rural area and I have walked my entire town and there’s no Pokémon anywhere! This game is a lot of fun when I visit the city, but there no point in playing out where I live when there’s nothing to do but walk.
I have been playing Pokémon Go for a little while, now after I first deleted it off my phone because I ran out of poke-balls. This makes me saddened. They should have unlimited poke-balls for all players. You shouldn’t have to purchase poke-coins or always go to check poke-stops. I can understand wanting to purchase clothing for your trainer. But not having to purchase Poké- balls so you can keep playing the game. 😥😰
I love how the new update can see what you have installed and do what an invasion of privacy
I live in a town of about 2,000 people so I would understand why there is less support for us but we have two major tourist spots for our town here from civil war era, no Pokémon will even show up on the nearby section anymore and the only gyms are at a park. Please improve appearance rates for rural areas!
Stop playing don’t sign out at all and do this quite frequently with no problems than go back on to the game and it want to sign with google account which it is already sign in didn’t sign out in the first place and keeps doing it. Then you sign in not the correct info on file take approximately 30 minutes to get it back up. So I decided to uninstall it not play it no more.
Since your currently not taking any complaints of questions I'm assuming you guys do not care about players enjoyment of your app. Anyways problem is my location will not work with my game I played it last night worked fine got up to walk this morning and now it doesn't even try to get my gps
Things to improve:  0) Please please change it back so that transferring or any other action doesn’t scroll back up to the very top. That is NOT a helpful update at all...  1) Sorting by HP should sort which Pokémon have the highest max HP, not which ones are out of health. Using items already shows you which ones are out of health.  2) Should be able to sell your unwanted/unneeded items to the store for coins.  3) The sightings section... could you put back the little leaves for Pokémon in the wild? That was such a cool system.  4) All the pikachu types should sort as their own Pokémon, like regular pikachu -> regular raichu -> ash hat pikachu -> ash hat raichu and so on with party hat pikachu and santa hat pikachu.  And for a bonus request...  5) Purple shoes!!! Or black shoes. ...or purple and black shoes 
music on device icon be alwsoume futre update like mario run pokmon music alwspume but  but music app icon for on device music device pokmon go alive and kicking song durring breeding eed hatch many enemys top gun danger zone or halo 4 rap dan bull
Pokémon Go is a great game I have played it since it came out and I enjoy watching the app develop. Although, it seems that less and less people are playing causing problems for people to find other people to do raids with.
I loved this game for 2 days until I ran out of pokeballs! I don't think that you need to buy pokeballs. So I think that you should put unlimited pokeballs and leave the rest of the stuff on there. Thank you for your time.🙃🙂
This game is really good to start, and don’t mistake me for the haters, but one day I woke up, got ready and all that stuff, then got my phone. I opened Pokémon go just to see what was happening. I looked at my area, and there was lots of gyms and raid battles. I went to the nearest groudon one, got my free raid pass and battled. This happend at least 7 times in a row until the battle ended where, I joined a group, it got 17 - 20 players then just as the go in the battle appeared, signaling it to start, it would kick me out and say I wasn’t close enough and say error 2 or 29. Like I said it happened until it ended so that was my free raid wasted. I was doin a daily jog and found a tyranitar raid that could still be happening now(8:58) and it did the exact same thing. At this point, I was very disappointed and tired with the game and deleted it. I AM DONE with this game. SCREW IT. I even have goddamned proof if you want it.
All the new features have brought so many players together. I love the weather most of all. I guess it’s the simple additions I cherish the most. No game will be perfect, which is why I love to get updates. Great family game to spend quality time together. Keep up the great work Niantic.
Add arabic language
Hi here i tried everything to sign in and register i cant can you fix it if its a bug I couldn’t play i tried pokemon trainer club i doesn’t work there’s no sign in with google button!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The new update has a bug that causes the Pokémon page to go back to the top after transferring or upgrading a Pokémon. TOTALLY ANNOYING!!! Please fix it!
Love the game
This game has gotten a lot of great updates! I started playing the day it came out along with the rest of the world. And, unfortunately, it faded away because it was missing key features... I just picked it back up and it’s gotten a lot better! However It’s still missing the following key features:  1. POKEMON TRADING BETWEEN PLAYERS - I caught a shiny Glalie and I’m dying to see what someone would trade me for it... but I can’t. Trading Pokémon doesn’t exist... is this even a Pokémon game without that?!  2. PLAYER RAID NOTIFICATIONS - every time I go to a raid, I go hoping someone else will be there to help me out. We need to be able to get in a waiting queue that will notify other nearby Pokémon go players that you are going to start this raid so they can come join you. Or vise verses. I want to see who is about to raid so I can go join them.   3. TRAINER VS TRAINER BATTLING - Nothing would be more like the original Pokémon game if we could battle with each other. Plus it would be a great way to practice gym and raid fights.  4. POKÉMON REGIONS - I would like to be able to see on the map, based off of my geographical location, what type of Pokémon are most common in my region. This would entice players to travel to new lands because they know they are going to find (certain type) Pokémon over one area than another. For example, the map could simply say you are now in a region where water type are more common.   If Niantic added these things along with whatever else they have in store for us I would be willing to pay! Literally add this and take my Money! Please!   P.S.  Niantic add yellow version to the App Store and I will buy it all over again!!! Any version and I will give you my money! We all would! Just make the game that we all want and love! Why do you think the whole world was outside playing Pokémon go the day it came out?! It’s because they thought it was yellow version but with AR!   Great job! We WANT MORE!!! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 
I live in a small town and I can’t find any Pokémon but when I went Of vacation to New York there were tons I th8nk you should make it even for everywhere
When you updated Pokémon go you changed how moving through your Pokémon worked if you transfer or evolve it always shoots you to the top of the list  I can barely power lever with lucky eggs or finish evolving all my Pokémon or evaluate what I want to keep or not I would like it if it stayed were you were at like before
We need trainer battles already, jeez.
Hi I haven’t gotten a chance to actually play since every time I open the app it says gps signal lost.. also I’m not getting any holiday incubators when I actually am able to play the game
Great, but needs more ways to get Pokecoins and username should be changed more than once. I was thinking maybe right after you make a name it would be available until you change it and then there would be a 30-day cooldown for every name change after that.
I used to play pokemon go everyday but now i dont and the reason for that is because pokemon go hates cars. I never have pokeballs and the reason for this is because when i see a pokestop while in the car i spin it and it says try later. I know this is supposed to be in the game but it is really annoying when I cant get a pokestop because I’m in the car. Please change this i would play the game a lot more if you did.
Hey just saying very annoying when I am trying to inventory and organize and it jumps me to top every time I trade a poke Mom in for candy fix please.
There needs to be a way you can trade and interact with other players!!! Please implement this through a poke center or through the gyms! That would be amazing!!!
When I transfer Pokémon the screen slides up to the top and I have to scroll back down to get to the same position.
This is is great game and most of this review is ranting, but there is problems. I still believe it deserves a 5 star rating.  If you are a new player, ignore this, it doesn’t really matter to you  1.the business decision: They have so far done nothing but release new Pokémon, but not new battle features, trading, etc. this gets back old players who  quit, but does not keep them.   2.the 3 generations of Pokémon currently in the game mean there is too many Pokémon. Gen 1 pokemon that used to be everywhere are now rare. Heck, when I first played you could go 5 steps without finding a pidgy, eevee, ryhorn, etc. Now I’ll go hunting for 2 hrs and only catch a few. This angers me, as I did not finish my gen 1 Pokédex. 
U should put a poke stop and gym at palm spring park
When this game first came out it broke records. People (including me) played it every day for months. But then it happened, I realized I was doomed because I don’t live in a big city. I noticed people all over social media (from those cities) seemed to find the best Pokémon with ease. Me? I was lucky to find the occasional scyther or squirtle in my smaller town. After grinding on pidgey’s to get into the high 20’s, I finally had to give up. It’s just not any fun to play in a rural area. Maybe it’ll get better. I hope so.   #MakePokemonGoGreatAgain 
I enjoy playing this game, and I play it frequently, but sometimes Pokemon return to me from a gym after being there for some time(over a day or so) and don’t bring back any coins with them. This has happened three times so far, and it’s very confusing. Could the devs please explain why this happens and possibly fix it? Please and thank you.
Update (1/02/2018): All previously mentioned issues below are still relevant (Errors with map loading at all/correctly). In addition, there is a bug when transferring Pokémon. After transfer is complete, Pokémon screen will return to top instead of returning to the spot of the last selected transferred Pokémon.   Update (12/19/2017): Maps are still not loading; streets are partially loaded or not loaded at all. This game is becoming more of a pain to play with each update. Seems like the game makers are more fixated on quantity than quality at this point.  Ever since the recent updates, my map does not load properly; whether on WiFi or 4G LTE. Prior to this update the roads would load just fine. Right not it’s saying my house and neighborhood streets are non existent and I’m walking in grass. This is a bug and a step down from previous versions. Fix ASAP!! 
Pokémon go has allowed so many people to find a love for Pokémon and just to be more adventurous and use their imagination! It’s so cool!
Since the new update, my pokemon go isn’t functioning very well. Iphone 6s
Finding the weather report annoying. Several unnecessary clicks to get into the game.
Nothing but empty screen.    GPS not located which is bogus! Boring game when you can't play
I know that is a online game, but it's still good because I found 2 Eevees in Danville.😃😃😃
I think that Pokémon is a grateful game and I love the game
For over two weeks I would go to a poke-stop but it still says I haven’t moved. It’s like the game is locked with my car. I have hard booted my iPhone and even deleted the game .. still shows I’m in my car when I’m not.
July 2016- that's how long I have been playing & have seem great improvements. BUT STARBUCKS IN COLCHESTER - NO MORE EX RAIDS ? What's going on with that ?! We are all very respectful there, and would love the raids back.  Can we get the transferring- unfavoring of Pokémon back to where you stayed there and aren't booted back to the top ? Pretty frustrating 😬 
This game is geared towards people spending money.  They do not listen to people playing.  Pretty much if players complain about any aspect of this game instead of fixing an issue they screw something else up.   Don’t waste your time or money on this game. 
Please update the game so it functions better on the iPhone X. Proportions are off
Fix request:  - For the previous app versions, when you are on the list Pokémon view > click into a Pokémon > go back to the Pokémon list view, the app would go to where the Pokémon that you clicked out of. Now the app goes all the way back to the top of the list, making Pokémon management very annoying. - same issue as above when transferring Pokémon   New feature request: - Sort or view by IV. Would save literally hours 
I’ve played this game before but recently got a new phone, and I forgot my log in info, when I made a new one it asked for a nickname after catching my first Pokémon, but every nickname it says it’s unavailable, please fix I really love this game and hate to see something like this ruin it for me
The latest update isn’t working so great. I caught a ton of Treecko’s and when I tried to trade 25 Treeckos to get 1 to evolve my 25 candies disappeared and then nothing happened. Talk about a buzz kill!
It was great when it first came out, but became repetitive as time went on. Catching the same character became boring, and it took too long to update new characters.
Latest update has a lot of positive features, but one bug makes it much more difficult:   Anytime I make a Pokémon a favorite or transfer it, the Pokémon list starts at the top again.   This means I have to scroll a lot to get back to that place in my inventory.  Very time consuming so I don't spend much time managing my Pokémon inventory.   And I end up playing less too.  Hopefully this will be fixed soon.
I used to live in the city and it was a great game. My son and I had a lot of fun with it. We recently moved to a rural area and there aren’t many pokastops. I think the developers of this app need to do more to make it accessible for everyone. What used to be a fun way for us to get it and do things together and got us outside and moving is now only accessible by driving around in a car. What a waste.
This bug is driving me crazy when I go in to clean up my Pokémon!  Everytime I transfer, make a favorite, etc., the screen returns to the top of the list.  This is very annoying when making decisions about many Pokémon.  This is discouraging me not to play!  Can someone please FIX this!!  I know I cannot be the only player this is happening to!  I am now just skipping the Pokémon that I have too many items on the screen that I have caught.  Please fix this, I want to continue playing!  Very time consuming and a waste of time.
I LOVE this game and play daily. Recently the game started taking you all the way to the top of the Pokémon in your bag after you transfer, evolve, or mark a favorite Pokémon. It drives me crazy! I wish it would go back to the way it was prior. Other than that, I love everything about it.
Because you have to lie about the date to play the game
Since I barely get any potions from pokestops or beating the gym pretty much majority of my pokemon are half dead...not much to do, guess time to retire from pokemon Go!!!
I am beyond annoyed! I signed in to my Pokémon go after getting a new phone and redownloading the app. Well when I signed in it was making me start all over!!!!!! This should not happen! As I’ve been playing since the day it was released!!!!!!!
The roads load when first opening Pokémon go but most of the time they don’t load at all. When the roads load the roads stop loading when going past the first loading distance. I thought that this was fixed in the new update but it was not. The pokestops keep saying try again later it’s so annoying. I wish that everything would be fixed!!!!!!!!!!!!
Whenever you guys make the next update, could you do a daily reward system. Like every day when a user logs in, they can get a daily reward. Like poke balls, etc.
Not sure why they’re forcing AR now but it’s ruined the game for me. Even un-checking the AR+ option still keeps AR on, just with a black background.
This game is addictive and buying things is cheap. I haven’t done raids yet, but I eventually will. I love how they added new Pokémon since the beginning. I had this game since it came out and I’m loving it. It’s really fun to play if you live in a city with a lot of places or visit one a lot that does. In my town there’s 4 poke stops and 1 gym. The two towns beside me have a lot. A hour and a half away has like 30 pokestops and 10 gyms and it’s great. I like the idea of getting people to exercise.
Everything about this game is painful! Your kid logs out and getting back in is hell on earth.
This is the worst game ever created this made my parents go nuts they don’t pay any attention to anything else but this game it turns them into zombies they don’t ever pay attention to us and they always play it this game needs to be deleted !
I'm happy with the new update so far. The only complaint I have is that transferring Pokémon puts me back at the top of my bag, whether I select multiple by holding down or select one from inside the appraisal screen. It's frustrating to try filtering through my bag when I have to keep scrolling back down to figure out where I was.
When deleting a Pokémon from inventory, the list resets back to the top instead of maintaining the current spot.  This causes a waste of time and a loss of place when trying to clean up your inventory.  Do you people even test the game before you push out updates?  You can’t possibly miss something this blatantly obvious!  If the game app has been left open in the background for long periods of time (day or more of not using it), when opening it back up, the game will sometimes lock up on the game screen as it starts.  Not the loading screen, but the in-game screen.  It never fully renders and you can’t touch anything in the GUI.  Game must be fully quit and restarted to clear this issue up.  It’s happened in previous version as well.  You need to fix this. 
I THINK THIS GAME IS BAD BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO CATCH POKÉMON. If you will please tell me I would love the game.  p.s. This game is terrible. 
Hey Niantic I Love This Game I’m A Addict To This Game And I Live In A Thriving Area Of 50,000 People.But I’ve had Some issues.1st Off When I’m In My Neighborhood Walking Or Sitting In My House I Have To Turn On Incense To Get Pokémon To Get To Me.2nd Off,Whenever An Update Comes You Guys Trick Me And When I Try To Update It.All It Does Is Just Shows The Open Button NOT a single hint to the update.3rd Off.Wi-Fi.Why Can’t This Be A Wi-Fi Free Game!Wi-Fi Free Games Are Always Best Selling!It Ain’t Fair That I Have To Get Off My Butt and look for Pokémon!4th off:Fairness.Really You People Always Make The Bigger Cities With Better Chances Of Better Pokémon!Why Can’t Every City Be Fair!That’s The Problem And That’s Why Your Losing Players!Because Things Are So Unfair And if you live in a big city or a suburb good for you!5th Off:Pokestops And Gyms.Listen I Love These 2 Objects But Why Can’t Everyone have a gym in their neighborhood I mean there’s always a forest or something in your neighborhood!!6th And Final Off:The AR.I Love The AR but the Screen is wobbly.Why Can’t When You Move The Acreen is sways with you.Please Make These Changes!
This is the best game for me
Hey Niantic! I LOVE this game. SO MUCH FUN!! But I have 1 small problem. It’s a glitch that I hope you guys will fix in a upcoming bug fixing update. When I transfer a Pokémon or update one it brings me back to the top to the starters. And I have to scroll back down and continue organizing. I have a lot of Pokémon and this just makes it so much harder to organize. Hopefully this gets fixed soon. But other then that this is the BEST app ever. Can’t wait for the Harry Potter game!!
I first installed Pokémon go when the hype train departed. I recently came back after a 6 month hiatus and I absolutely love playing
Overall the game is great. It’s fun, and everything, but there is some room for improvement. I’m on team Red, but my best friends are on team blue. If there was a team changing option, this was be 5 Stars. Hope this is taken into consideration.
The update and the improvements that they made is amazing and all, but I cannot enjoy the game if there is always a internet connection problem. The game is supposed to be able to let people walk around and catch Pokémon, but the Internet connection really defeats the purpose of Pokémon GO. Please, fix this issue because I really want to actually enjoy a game that doesn’t require internet.
This game is so dumb cause it keep on loging me out until I cloud not even login or use the app. If you read this review, I would not reckonmend using the app. This was a was’t of time, money, and family qualitie time. I used to love Pokémon go but now I hate the company souls so much.
The app will not load says it can't find gps signal
The app is running better then it used to but it's still not perfect. Last night I was sitting on my bed using the app and it showed me moving around a lot and I even got the "your moving too fast, it shouldn't be played while driving" message even though I wasn't moving
KEEPS SAYING CAN’T AUTHENTICATE!! WAS ON IT LAST NIGHT AND WORKED JUST FINE!! I HAD THE GAME DELETED FROM MY PHONE FOR THE LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF THIS SAME PROBLEM. I LOADED IT BACK ON MY PHONE LAST NIGHT AND HAD TO CHANGE MY PASSWORD AND IT STARTED AGAIN. THIS GAME USED TO BE FUN, NOW ITS JUST A BILE OF CRAP!!! I GUESS I’M DELETING IT FOR GOOD!!! NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIX.
I feel that it would be in all of us Pokémon players best interest that whenever you transfer a Pokémon we already get a candy for that Pokémon but I feel that players should also get back the pokeball the Pokémon was in because I personally run out of balls too quickly for this very reason so please just take this into consideration?
being kicked back to the top of the list of pokémon after every action is horrible! on what planet is this a feature?!?! plz fix this.
When I try to get in and catch the first Pokémon it won’t work!
Ok here I was will my parent try to get me a account and when we tried to set up my account it said "incorrect email," or "password is to short," and all the crap. It was like trying to do the impossible. I wish the would make it less complicated, so I could actually play Pokémon go. I hope no one else is happening this and I hope the creators see this and make it easier to sign up. Thank you for reading this and have fun trying to set up a account. I do hope you can, if the creators make it any harder to.
Fix your app. After The last update, when you are favoring or transferring Pokémon, every time you make a move it takes you back to the top of your Pokédex. It is annoying needs to be fixed.
Please fix the scrolling issue that causes your Pokémon list to automatically go back to the very top anytime you do something to a Pokémon such as transfer, favorite or evolve it.
There is a glitch that ends a raid battle 10 seconds before it is supposed to end
Hey add friends were you can see players trade pokemon and items and even better battle them please add this before gen 4 Because I know this game is awesome.
Okay, so this game has a couple of small flaws, glitches and hijinks here and there.  Every game does.  The day a developer puts out a fun, attention grasping game like this with out a single bug or glitch... well it just won’t happen.  Instead of complaining about what I don’t like, I’ve got some constructive criticism.. This game would benefit GREATLY from an item trading system.  I play with my fiancé every day, and she has 12 kings rocks.. I have a whopping 0.  We talk every day about how nice it would be if she could just give me one in exchange for one of my 84 revives that she desperately needs.  If I would request anything from Niantic, it’s an item trading system!  Please!! All that aside, like I said, we play this all day everyday.  At work, out doing errands, at home on the couch.  My Fiancé and I absolutely love this game.. excellent addition to the Pokemon gameverse. 
Ooooommmmmgggggg!!!! I love Pokémon at the time and Pokémon Go makes my life better!!:)
Latest update refreshes the Pokemon list to the top after every transfer.  Not cool.  Please fix this so after a transfer, your position in the Pokemon list stays the same.
Location accuracy needs a little adjustment, I live near a gym but when I cross the street to go use it my avatar gets positioned 50 yards away from where I’m actually standing
I love playing Pokémon Go but some recent changes have really hurt the game. Please fix the app so when you favorite or transfer a Pokémon it doesn’t jump to the beginning of the list again. So frustrating! Never used to happen before.
I love my Pokémon go bracelet but it would never connect to my Bluetooth when it used to work on my iPhone SE and now it doesn’t and I feel like the connection should work within bug fixes and everything but I would like to have it to be working again!!!
Absolutely love this! It has connected me with so many amazing people. My only complaint is twice now I’ve purchased coins... well I’ve gotten charged but have not received the coins! I’ve reached out to apple and they can’t help. So I’m out $40 but have nothing to show for it. That’s pretty lame. I’ve never spent money in an app before so I don’t know if this is a normal thing but it’s disheartening.
I love this game, but honestly the graphics and UI make this game feel like it's still in beta testing mode. Please make the game more professional-looking (aesthetically pleasing) and easier to use.
I love the new update.  I wonder what you consider “hazardous weather”? I always get those alerts since the update, see but that’s because I live pretty much at the North Pole. Haha. 
3rd generation is on and my childhood memories of me playing Pokemon Emerald are back! Love the gameplay but about this newest update there are two things bothering me!   1. Shouldn’t the climate function work like the real life weather of the area? So why am I receiving the weather info of other cities far from me? Wouldn’t it be better to receive info of nearby cities or even my current location? It’s really annoying to play like that!   2. When will be finally able to play against other players via bluetooth or whatever?  3. Is it time already to change how the gyms work? They all look the same to me, since people put always the same strong pokemons! 
After the newest update it says something about 11 please fix
I mean the game is pretty fun but there is only Poké Gym battles and Raids if not I can only catch Pokémon and find Poké Stops, I would like to battle wild Pokémon like the original Pokémon game on 3DS such as: Pokémon Omega Ruby, Pokémon Sapphire, Pokémon Sun & Moon and Pokémon Sun and Moon Wonderlocke,  it would also be nice if I could find other Pokémon trainers and battle them and trade Pokémon for better ones!
Ok so I agree with everyone who say ppl who live in rural places matter and ppl who live in the suburbs. Not everyone lives in cities ok?! You need to place poke stops and gyms all around the map not just the in the cities. AND RESPOND TO THE REVIEWS!!!! Add more selections for editing your avatar more hairstyles and colors, bigger variety of clothing, and something that would be rlly cool would be hight and like kid mode or something!! 👧👦🧑 but overall I like the game but needs improvements.
Love playing, However I keep getting kicked out of the game, I repeatedly try opening it however it will shut itself out, I’ve deleted it and redownloaded it but it still won’t work... I can’t even get to the main screen to log into my account... 😩
If you loved pokemon as a kid and aren't afraid of getting off the couch then this is the app for you. It does have some bugs but they are fixing them and have already had two updates in the week since I've had the app. It hasn't fixed all the problems but it has helped. Its  a little silly to expect anything more from an app that suddenly gained this much popularity.  The best thing about this app is that it has a ton of potential and you're bound to see it grow as people continue to use it.  Update: Obnoxious big that restarts menu everytime I evolve of name a pokemon 
After transfering, my page always returns to the top!  Makes both features tedious and time consuming. Please fix this issue.
the app wont let me login anymore. this i dind disappointing. is there a bug fix for this?
I like most of the new updates to the game. However, I find the “bug” annoying where every time yo change anything to a Pokémon, it sends you back to the top/beginning of the list EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. It wastes so much time having to scroll back to where you left off, especially when you’re in the midst of catching all these new Pokémon you’ve released. You had it perfect before - why the change? I hope you change it back to the way one could easily manage their Pokémon, as before.
I love Pokémon and have been playing since I was a little kid. When this game first came out I was super excited. I dealt with the lag and poor gps sync because this game was far bigger than Niantic. As time went on and you were able to get servers to handle the fan base things started getting better. Until you started pushing updates. You’re not releasing all of the next gen before moving to the one after that, which is annoying, and with each update there’s always something over looked. Every time I look at a specific Pokémon, when I close out to go back to my main list it “refreshes” and starts me back at the top. When trying to transfer Pokémon to get more candies for an evolution this is extremely irritating. On top of that, I can’t add Pokémon to gyms. No matter what I get told the gym is under attack. I’ve restarted my phone, deleted and redone loaded the game and still, cannot place a Pokémon on a gym. I’ve had issues like this every update. I think I’m done with this game.
I don’t normally write reviews. Since I play Pokémon Go so much (and I hope that Niantic actually reads reviews), I decided to state a fairly sizable inconvenience my family has with a game that we all love. Up until recently, if we transferred a Pokémon (or did comparable actions) we’d be brought back to the area in the Pokémon bag that we just came from. It made it easier to continue where we left off when working with our entire Pokédex.  Now, if I transfer my 380th Pokémon (for example), when done it spits me back to the top of the list again. It takes so long to keep scrolling back and forth to take care of all the Pokémon that it becomes an annoyance. If we can get it to be like how it was before, it’ll make it so much easier to work with this ever expanding list of Pokémon. Thanks. 
It has recently become almost impossible to catch some Pokemon. Doesn't seem to matter how many Razz Berries or Ultra Balls used, certain Pokemon always run away. The Torchic has two evolutions, the first takes 25 candy and the second 100 candy. The ratio of balls to catch is completely out of proportion! Almost all of my tosses catch, rarely a miss, getting 🔥 that almost all break out and run away! Seems like a ruse to force you to purchase Pokeballs from the store. Not happy!
This game is really fun but I deleted it for a bit and when I went to download it again, it wouldn’t let me sign in with my email! All my work was deleted. Fix This!
Anytime you transfer, rename, evolve, or favorite a Pokemon the Pokemon list scrolls automatically back to the top! This bug was discovered seconds after this update was release. How convenient for niantic to not have time to fix thie annoying f*king bug!
It updated and now says no gps signal fix please
Everything works fine but gives out way to many poke balls which is good but dosent give out any healing iteams
I’ve played since the game came out and it’s always been a blast. The continued additions have kept things interesting.  Just needed to report a super annoying bug from the latest update. Anytime you transfer or favorite a Pokémon the list automatically returns to the top. Crazy annoying and time consuming to try and keep up your Pokémon now. Please push an update to fix this soon. Seems like a simple fix.  Just make it like it used to be. 
Worked like a charm. I really like if you walk away from five Pokémon at the beginning you can get a Pikachu. I was able to get a really high level I don't remember but I got deleted so I've been in love you guys make more games like this
I have tried and tried and tried! I just CANT WALK. its pretty boring if you cant walk all you do is wait for the pokemon to come to YOU. I even saw a PIKACHU and couldnt get to it... oh and i have a iphone so... maybe.. it dosnt work for iphones?!?!
Some people don’t even have half of the Pokemon there are, they should stop adding more Pokemon. Also I like the weather thing they added in Pokémon go, it really helps. But they should have a thing we’re you can buy or sell Pokemon that would be great. But this game is pretty good!
This is probably my favorite game of all time. I live in an area that isn’t really rural or urban but have Pokémon spawners around me. But I want the cool AR update too! However it’s only 6s and later. I have I 5s and I really want this super cool feature. Otherwise awesome app definitely worth the download. It truly does get you in shape. Before this awesome app I could only jog a mile, now, I can jog between 4-5 miles! Thank you Pokémon go for this app and thanks Niantic for creating this lit game!
What the heck! Now when we transfer a Pokémon the app takes you all the way back up to the top of your list. We are NOT done with where we were at! This is a ridiculous change and needs to be reversed, it pisses several people off.
I just downloaded it and it is in the process of downloading. I heard many great things about this game and I am super excited to play it. But I gave it 4 stars because where I live I own about 20 acres of land. My family has looked around but where places have woods around you they just don't have any.
Love the game but new glitch has made it incredibly difficult. Now when I transfer Pokémon instead of returning to the section of Pokémon I was looking in, the game automatically scrolls to the top of my Pokémon list. This makes mass transferring incredibly time consuming because every time I transfer a Pokémon I have to scroll down and find my place again. Please fix!!
Hey, I love the app. But, when I walk distances my dude won’t move a budge at all. Please, fix this.:(
Great game but every time I transfer a Pokémon it goes back to the top of my list. it doesn’t stay at the same point in the list that I was at. That’s quite annoying when I’m trying to clean up my Pokémon list.
I had this problem as I returned to play today. After logging out and trying to re log in, it persisted. I’ve deleted and downloaded the app again but there is no fix . Please help resolve the issue.  I have the latest game version and phone updates. 
Just a thought on how a update to feed your Pokémon in your bag berries to receive more candies. Or to feed them berries to level up as well but the candies idea mainly
The most recent update pushes weather related information. First, every drop of rain does not constitute severe weather. The notifications are an unnecessary nuisance, ESPECIALLY during a raid battle.
Going back to the top every time you do anything with the Pokémon is ridiculous. You can’t even evolve them without having to go to the very top for each Pokémon and scrolling all the way back down to where ever you were. This happened during your last update please take care of it.  I as well as others are unable to evolve and I can’t really even use the lucky eggs as that’s what are used him for mostly. I enjoy playing this as I am walking for exercise, it works well with my ADHD
I play every day, and I HATE that every time you make a change to the Pokémon storage (transfer a ‘mon, Mark a favorite, or rename it) you’re taken back to the top of all the ‘mon. It’s extremely frustrating when you’re trying to sort out the storage and get things sorted to evolve. Please change it back!!!!
I am an army veteran with PTSD and with my anxiety so high most of the time, my sister in law said I should download the app. So July 7, 2016 I did. Every time i have an attack I go walk and play the game and I find that it helps me get through it. Not only do I play as a form of therapy but since I started playing I have lost 51 pounds and counting. I thank you all for this awesome app!!
So ive had multiple pokemon in gyms for a whole day now, and when they got kicke dout and cane back, I HAVENT GOTTEN ANY COINS?? I should have so mang buy now but for some reason im not getting them?
There's only 151 Pokémon to me. The new ones ruined the game.
I hate that everytime you transfer a Pokemon or evolve it brings you back to the top of your Pokémon collection!! SUPER ANNOYING! Other than that best game ever
My dad calls it Poke-E-man-go
Ever ee day
Plz don’t change to allow trading.  It will be no fun anymore. That’s the whole challenge of the game ... chasing rare ones down!  Trading will only allow people to start selling online and stuff like that.  YOU WANT IT ....find it !
i live in a fairly rural area; my house is surrounded by other houses but we have bigger roads nearby so it's easy to get around.  unfortunately, the closest pokestops are either a tiny little church blocks away (3-5 minutes by car) that i have to borderline trespass to get the pokestop to work for me; otherwise a fountain across from walgreens that is AGAIN PRIVATE PROPERTY.   since every pokestop is a statue or a church, i go through hell and back looking for pokestops.  i haven't touched the app in MONTHS since every time i enter, i either have monumental issues with the map or my character, or alternatively 3-8 pokemon i sometimes need surround me (and i can't catch them bc i only have TWO normal pokeballs left).  "why can't you just get driven? you said you could before." i can hear being voiced to me.  THE. APP. R E F U S E S. TO. LET. ME. PLAY. PROPERLY.   usually i get driven by my father since i'm not of legal age to drive.  THE GAME WON'T LET ME SELECT THAT I DON'T DRIVE.  as a result, the app becomes laggy with the same BS pop-up every five minutes.  if i keep saying i'm not driving then WHY is the app still asking?  on top of this, i'm in Instinct, meaning i can barely find any gyms under my team's control.   i have never received any pokecoins in my game time; i've been playing since august 2016.   please fix this or eventually this app will become deleted out of becoming a useless waste of data on my phone. 
I love Pokémon go sooooooo much my favorite Pokémon is glaceon I looove glaceon
I absolutely love this game but I haven’t been able to catch any Pokémon because it keeps glitching and won’t let me Cat any. I’ve checked the network and service and they both were fine. And please make more hairstyles for they avatars. Thank you and I would appreciate if you fixed this because I love this game.
When going into a Pokémon’s details to favorite or unfavorite it jumps back to the top of your Pokémon list. I would like it to go to the same place in the list I was there before. It’s time consuming to have to scroll and find where you were. Thank you.
Not that many bugs that bother me, but i've noticed that when transferring pokémon, once the pokémon is sent out, the game brings you back to the top of the list. not sure if that's meant but can get pretty annoying when you have 1000+ pokémon
In this latest version, as you’re scrolling down the list to view pictures Pokémon, any action (such as transferring or opening that Pokémon to view it), Immediately afterwards, the list of Pokémon automatically takes you back to the start of the list. With hundreds of Pokémon, this is incredibly difficult to manage your Pokémon. Should default back to your same spot in the list after taking the action.
I love this game! I loved Pokémon as a kid but never got the chance to play the video games! This is a great way for me to relive that childhood fun!   But just to let you know, there is a bug (or I think it is) where after I transfer a Pokémon to Professor Willow my list goes back to the top. It is kind of annoying especially when I am going through my Pokémon. I wasn’t sure how to let you guys know so I figured I’d leave a review! And honestly that’s my only complaint of the game! 
This game is very fun and I recommend it to everyone but the people like me that live in the middle of nowhere shouldn’t have to use their insense every 30 minutes to catch like four Pokémon!
Had fun with this game til each time I fave a Pokémon or try to transfer several Pokémons at once that it jumps all the way back to top of the screen. Then I have to rescroll all the way back to where I was. There's no way for me to try to contact Niantic about this issues, as there's no section just for technical difficulties.  If this is a bug, please please have it fixed. I enjoy the game but with this issue, it makes it less fun and more irritating. I've tried deleting the app and then reinstalling. I've tried logging out and then back it and the issue is still there. So until this is fixed, I can't give more than 1 star. 
Not pleased at all. It’s one thing if you’re at gyms with a high turnover, but this was one gym that was perfect and I avoided placing any other pokemon in gyms knowing that 50 was the cap per day.  The reward could have been at least 50 per day THAT I WAS DEFENDING THE GYM. Doesn’t even make the gyms worth it now. There’s no experience for the pokemon or leveling them up, so there’s not much else to work with in the gyms. 
The new update caused what I hope is a bug where whenever you transfer a Pokémon, you are brought up to the top of the list again. Hoping the next update fixes this as it’s extremely annoying!
Every time I look transfer, or evolve a pokemon, right after it starts from the very top of the list instead of staying on the same location I was looking at. Please fix, it’s really irritating and time consuming.  Also another thing, please fix the gps locator for iPads. Majority of the time they are pretty off(we have 2). 
Please fix the bug that returns me to the top of my list of sorted Pokémon after I transfer a pokemon to the professor or evolve a Pokémon. This is so frigging annoying esp when you’re trying to evolve in a 30 min lucky egg time window and wasting so much time browsing back down to where you were before. This is just so so annoying please fix.
It’s been several months and Many updates.  For some reason my Pokémon go app does not respond to my GPS signal making it impossible for me to continue playing  Please fix this issue 
Twice I have purchased the .99 Pokémon coins only to have it deduct my iTunes account but never gave me the Pokémon coins. Perhaps they should quit worrying about how people play so they can fix the bugs that are cheating their customers.
Newest update sends Pokémon n inventory list back to top after every action and have to scroll back down every time you appraise transfer or almost any thing else you do. Gets seriously annoying quick
Niantic needs to update the game and put more Pokestops in rural areas. I play everyday and feel at a disadvantage to people that live in the city. As much as i play i shouldve been at level 40 by now. Ive caught more Pokemon than players that are already at level 40. Doesn’t seem right. We need more rare Pokemon spawns then the same old common ones. It’s getting real boring seeing the same things over and over. Enough already or Niantic will lose a lot of loyal players. Lastly, drop the exclusive raids for Mewtwo its a disservice to all players.
Where you can trade Pokémon with other people
Fun to play and good way to see interesting landmarks. Raids are a little difficult if you are in a small town with not many players. New Pokemon introduced are nice. The recent update has an error, though. When I try to evolve a Pokemon, I don’t see the animation and it doesn’t show evolved Pokemon until I close out of new monster and go to my poke bag.
This is what kids play a lot this what it is about catching Pokémon.It depends the game it self is pretty fun great to play enjoyable but, the Company Niantic is not good on updates.Now if they did it would been taking most of every state playing.Over a year ago it was about a lot of people playing this game of Pokémon. 
I used to played this a lot until some updates came and could never play without WiFi. I have very good LTE network and still never works with the game. 5 stars for.. A better game 
With at LEAST half the pokemon I encounter, they simply won’t go into the ball, even if i use my great razz berry + ultra ball on a 200 CP (FYI it was the last GRB I had and it was a Phanpy) I love this game to bits but you HAVE to fix this! (I use an iPhone 6)
This game is my fav game because they just keep adding update so I just think it is a awesome game for pokefans.
This is getting ridiculous. Pokémon are getting harder to catch, the number of items received from pokestops has been considerably reduced, and the quality of items has been nerfed to the point of absurdity. Max Potions? Nope. As soon as the drop rate there was reduced, lo and behold you now can PAY for a whopping ten potions. These decisions are cumulative. Items drop less frequently and are lower quality. Items I do have are now burned through faster since Pokémon are harder to catch. Max potions are virtually non-existent from random drops, meaning I have to use a revive AND stacks of regular potions just for a single gym battle. To put this bluntly, fix the game. I am not and will not pay to win. Nor will I grind endlessly just to get enough items to play. I hit, on average, 5-6 pokestops twice a day. If that’s not enough to get what I need to even play, I’m done. I will delete this app in a heartbeat and advise everyone I know to do so as well if this continues.
Been playing since the game came out and have watched the bugs come and go but the latest thing with the transfers seems to get on mine and many others nerves.  Please address the issue where the Pokémon list automatically goes to the top after a transfer. 
Epic game but make this game without WiFi please so my friends can play because they have iPads
I love this app. I think what would love to be implemented is that you can interact with other Pokémon trainers. With either trading and giving or even seeing where they are and having Pokémon battles with them!
The PoGo app on my phone won’t sync with the PoGo app on my Apple Watch to track my egg distance or track the work out in my activity for the egg distance either. I’ve restarted the devices, closed the apps, everything but it still tells me on my watch to open PoGo on my iPhone
I love the game and all but I’m tired of the hairstyles instead of the ponytail
Best iOS game to date
This game came out in 2015 or 2016, this game is dead. This game is very dangerous game, too. This game has killed or injured many people. #LifeClaimer #StopPlayingThisGame #SOLASTYEAR
When my friends and I got Pokémon go, we were exited but deleted it because when we tried to log on it takes so long and each time I come up with a good password it just dose this weird thing and restarts and said my password wasn’t good enough
Ok, so I love this game and all it has for it, but Niantic won’t listen to the community about anything since the start. They won’t tell us about certain things happening in the game until people have to literally get into the games files to find information about updates and events. Or how they will change things wether we know about it or not. Like for example we can go back to the past about the three-step bug or to a new thing like raid bosses changing for literally no reason. This is how they ended up killing their old game, Ingress. By not listening to the community and ultimately losing players. And with a Harry Potter game around the corner, they’ll most likely do the exact same thing they did to the other two games, not listen to the community, your fans and players, and have the game basically die due to frustrations. So using think they’ll ever change even with this third game coming out. So even if you’ve read this far I’d suggest giving the game a try but don’t expect anything that you’d like to make the game better.
Love the app and its really fun, but with this last version everytime I choose a pokemon to do something or select a bunch to transfer, immediately after I’m done it will send me back to the top of the list.
I wasn’t really that mad at all the continuous updates on this game until recently. The way the gyms are run now is ridiculous. Your Pokémon lose cp if they are in a gym even if no one battles them, plus there is a limit to how many Pokémon you can have in gyms. How am i supposed to get my coins up if there is a limit on the coins i can earn? Am i just supposed to pray that no one kills my gym Pokémon after his cp goes down from getting bored? You guys at niantic need to put the gyms back to the way they used to be and take away this cap limit on gym Pokémon because no one wants to spend their hard earned money on “Poke-coins”
This game is trash. Every time I open the app it it locks me out of my phone then I have to restart it and it won’t delete ☹️
The reason I like this game bracos use it lets you ecplore you touwn and maybe your in tire city so for that I have gone to a bunch of places
I tried every password that I have and it always says wrong credentials there is no way to get into this app
Now I really want to kill myself for all your controlling
I like the game but I would like it more if you guys would add trading you guys said you were going to add it when you made Pokémon go but you didn’t
Worthless game for teenage girls
Open up the game crash open up your inventory crash sometimes you cannot even catch the first Pokémon because it crushes like Nintendo please please whatever you do fix this in the next update like it would not be half as bad if you know you could actually play the game like me I only got one Pokémon before it crashed so much I deleted it but then I would get it back several times then delete it again so you can see it crashes way too much for the people that think it is good you are wrong Pokémon go crashes play too much
Whenever I get to a pokestop and try it o spin it, it always says try again.
The only things needed to make this game 5 Star is the ability to battle friends and other trainers. The next thing is the ability to trade. This game is fun overall and I play Pokémon Go everyday but I would enjoy seeing some of the things I mentioned.
You had a brilliant game up until you messed up and made exclusive regional Pokemon to be honest I don't and won't plan on ever leaving. The United States so you've messed over so many players I hope you guys just give people the ability to collect them all without having to travel
Anytime I transfer a Pokémon TJ he next screen is at the tip again, forcing me to have to scroll down over and over.  Program used to leave me where I left off. Discouraging
This game is very glitchy and horrible. It randomly closes the app when I am playing and it is a waste of time.
The game needs trading and pvp.
New Pokémon are great, so is AR+ but this update makes Pokémon go + not work correctly. It needs to be fixed
All I can say!!
Overall the game is a lot of fun and I enjoy playing but the Ex raids are unfair to people who live in small towns, people who work, and people who actually have a life and not able to play on a constant basis. Most raids occur during work hours so trying to round up players is a difficult task in general and ex raids only add to that disadvantage. JMO
This is almost the worst game ever I hate it donor download this
This is the first time I've ever reviewed anything, and I have been compelled to do so by one very patience-trying bug. This has been mentioned by other users, so I'm hoping that the more of us speak up about it, the faster Niantic will jump in and patch it.  Every time I go through my Pokémon storage to transfer, I get redirected back to the top of the page. It's annoying at best and infuriating at worst. It's time-consuming having to go through and transfer unwanted Pokémon; it's worse to have to scroll all the way back down to where you left off to continue.  Please fix this ASAP, Niantic! 
I can’t login to my dads account because I deleted it on accident so does this mean I have to get a new phone or account this is years of progress and I can’t access it why?
They be BS
It’s cool but I can’t get rare pokes were I live and it’s to hard to get coins
Whenever you transfer or rename a Pokémon and then hit the x button, it brings you back to the top of the list. Please fix this!
This game I personally love. It’s very creative ,and it helps lazy modern kids to get out and get exercise! Although it’s a very good idea I have a couple of suggestions; like you should be able to start clans where you put a couple of your friends in a group! Along with clans you could put your Pokémon in gyms and split the poke-coins. You could also ad to where you can see their player model if they’re in a clan! You could even set up events where rival teams can battle and just think of the money you could get from that! You should also make it to where you can have trading and a bit of back up for that so that people don’t get scammed. Take animal jam for example; you start a trade then both people have to press accept twice. For example: one person wants three poke balls for a potion one person has three poke balls and wants a Potion the both press accept twice and they had an even trade and were both happy! I think these are great ideas as long as you don’t charge people to join a clan or something. Anyway I hope whoever reads this has a wonderful day!
It will not
I could be right where a pokestop is, and when I click on it it says “walk closer “. How much closer do you want me to get??? Then all those annoying warnings about your speed when I’m not even moving is a negative. Even as they continue to add new Pokémon to the game, the same repetitive ones still show up all the time.
I didn't play the game for a little while due to my busy schedule. When I did start playing again it needed updating as usual, so I did the update. The weird thing is tho some of the Pokémon I've caught or seen in the wild are no longer registered in the Pokedex at all, and they're not in my list of caught mons either. Not sure why, maybe due to the time spent not playing???
This latest update is a disaster. I’m not sure which is worse, the nearly constant pop up messages or the fact that any interaction with my list of Pokémon results in scrolling all the way back to the top. I have nearly 700 Pokémon and I must say, it is extremely frustrating to be scrolling through the list, finding Pokémon I want to transfer (or name, or power-up,etc) and then having to scroll through again to find where I was in the list; over and over and over. I thought that was bad enough until today. As of this morning, I spend less time playing now than I do dismissing irritating warnings about extreme weather, asking if I’m a passenger (I’m sitting at a desk, by the way), or telling me repeatedly what kind of Pokémon match the weather conditions. These messages should be something we can turn off in settings. Every pop up message should have a “do not show me again“ checkbox. The “I’m a passenger” message should have a special checkbox that reads “Shut up and mind your own business”. 
I can't even get into the game and if tried both methods to signing in authorization not available everytime is annoying to see used to be a fan but now 👎,delete this app if your new it's a waste of you time.
I can not stop playing this game.It’s always a treat for me I have no idea why so many people hate this game I mean It is the best!😱😱😱😱😱😱🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩.If ur buying this u are going to love it so much!
Not accepting my email address
I like the game but my phone starts out on 100% then 70% then 40% each 5 minutes.
I just got my jogger medal which takes 1000 km, and it didn’t even let me know i had achieved this.  Also when I transfer or star a Pokémon, it scrolls back to the top of my 700 mon, so I have to find my place again with every transfer & starring of a mon. Pretty annoying... the graphics look great.
Every time I try to catch a Santa Pikachu or a Treecko my game freezes and I get an error. Very disappointed. 🙁
Good game but if you don’t live in a city than you can’t do raids, a big part of the game.
I love this game, but when I get on it. The app acts like I’m moving and walking when I’m standing in the same spot. It great when your trying to hatch eggs, but I had three Pokémon that I hadn’t caught before, and it took me away from them. Not cool. I hope y’all fix this bug soon.
It’s been so long since the release and yet no pvp or trading?
I keep trying to enjoy the game again, but end up deleting it each time. The constant massive updates are frustrating. Half the time I need a huge update when I’m out and want to play. Also, the company just stopped accepting all suggestions for Pókestops and my tiny town just got a massive mall that would be perfect to revive the game here. The game also sincerely needs more goals, ways to track and planning... that was something it always lacked. It just leaned onto the cool AR feature.
I use to love playing Pokemon go, but now I uninstalled  it. I also downloaded this game again, but instead of Email/Gmail, it needed Trainer pass OR whatever it's called..... I now will never play this game until I can just use my Email/Gmail instead of Trainer Pass or whatever.... Bye bye Pokemon go and Hello DigimonLinks! DigimonLinks is a fun game.... I also love Pokemon AND Digimon..... Also I'm happy with the new Pokémon Gen. update....... 
I’m not really happy about this latest update. While in my Pokémon bag, if I click on any Pokémon and then exit bag to the screen or if I transfer Pokémon, after the transfer is complete I am sent back to the very beginning of my list. Please fix this. I did not have this issue prior to the update.
Go
Since the iOS 11 update the Pokémon go plus is barely functional .  I bought new batteries just in case and both of the ones I have get stuck ona stop and just vibrate.  It’s not as snappy as it used to be and is really ruffling my feathers since I bought it .  People pay real money for his game and those things should work correctly.
Attention Niantic, I am a big fan of pokemon go just like other people's who used to be, but because of the battery drainage of this game I stop playing, along with others people as well I guess. The real issue is battery drainage which could be the reason why other people stop playing now if you could fix this problem, I will be glad to start playing this again. There are also update that people want such as communicating with Pokémon go player in game through friend list and buddy chat. Another update we are waiting for is being able to trade with other trainers which would really begin a friendship and make this game much more fun. So far all of this update that you are releasing are really amazing, so keep up the good works but along I would really see these update in the game; but the first thing in order to bring back the other trainer is to fix the battery issue. Thank you for taking the time to reading my feedback.
This is not an occurrence for every one how you have 50 players or what level they are or how you said that the fan base is getting angrier Which does not mean that every one is angry because I could give 0
Love the addition of gen 3 Pokémon. I am able to log into the game and play. The current tracking system is workable. Continue to work on bringing us features we saw in the trailer and maybe people will come back to this game. Also continue to solve technical issues and bugs.
I have an iPhone 6 and update iOS. My problem with my Pokémon Go app is the AR access. But other than that the app is great!
Love Pokemon . Don’t love that I get 1 potion from every 30 stops now. Also don’t love that the list of Pokémon scrolls back up to the top every time you favorite or transfer .
Ok so I have a big problem I ran out of poke balls and I have no coins yes, it’s true you can go to poke stop and get free balls but it’s snowy outside we’re I’m at and my mom says to wait u til spring or summertime so can you do an update we’re there’s a daily gift we’re they give you 10 pokeballs everyday. I also have another update for you guys a sun and moon update can you add poplio , brionne and primarina, Litten torracat, incineroar, rowlet, Datrix and decicueye   ( plz add thease Pokémon)
I hate this it won’t even let me sign up!I’m very mad!
Recently “upgraded” to the iPhone X from the 7 and this app doesn’t work at all. Error code 11. I’ve tried with battery saver on an off, along with a mix of other settings. I’ve closed and re-opened. Nothing has helped so far.
Recently the game was updated to drop less items for players, making it mostly unplayable for casual gaming. Unless you want to pay real money to buy said items, which I'm sure was the point of the update.   Not cool, Niantic/Nintendo, not cool. 
Please, please fix! It’s so frustrating that after every time you transfer something it takes you back up to the top!!! It wastes so much time, especially when you’re evolving Pokémon with a lucky egg on!!! Grrrrrr!!!!
This game just became so much more annoying with the most recent update. You added a ton more Pokemon (yay!) which means I routinely have 1000 in my bag. Then you made it so every single action..delete, rename, star...sends you up to the top. I do not have time to keep scrolling down when I am trying to weed out duplicates or evolve the ones that are ready!!!
Rip in dead
Every time you do anything to a pokemon, delete, favorite, evolve... it now scrolls all the way to the top of your pokemon  Please fix this  Also.. why does it take so long to load your pokemon? Just download them to the device? Or at least give that option.. don’t have 7 years to wait for pokemon to load thanks 
please fix how long it takes for the game to boot up, it nearly takes five minutes to get into the game itself, its ridiculous
My Pokémon go plus won’t work with my iPhone 7. Pokestops have become incredibly difficult to pick up. Pokémon no longer spawn anywhere near my house, I have to drive into town to play. Legendary are pretty to look at but I have no hope of catching as they are impossible for a group of 3 to beat in time.   I love this game and play daily but I wish they’d tweak it a little for those who live in more rural areas. 
Tired of the mandatory updates, never convenient
The bet mobile game ever
It is getting worse as they cram more features in the game and almost unplayable now.  Game keeps crashing and frozen in the middle of playing.  The most annoying feature (bug) is that it snaps back up to the beginning of the Pokémon deck every time after I transfer one.  Please fix it.
Every time I evolve or transfer a Pokémon it shifts back to the very top of the Pokémon I have caught. It’s very annoying
There’s a bug right now, at least I hope it’s a bug, that when you scroll down and transfer a Pokémon it starts back at the top again.  It’s annoying and time consuming. Can we get a fix please.
This game is really fun, I’m really happy with generation three and the weather changes, but potions have become like extremely rare in pokestops and gyms. I’ve been spinning like 30-40 pokestops today and I didn’t get a single potion. All my Pokémon are dead or at half health because of revives. Please fix this, I can’t do raids or even fight gyms because I cannot heal my Pokémon!
I am not sure if it’s the iPhone X or the new update but when I transfer or favorite Pokémon it will immediately bring me back to the top of my Pokémon list. Pretty annoying, please fix!
Has made my "go plus" a very cute paper clip. Good thing I didn't want to use it to catch Pokemon or anything. Because that feature is completely gone now. Where as minutes before I updated it was working just fine.
I agree with the comments about difficulty in raiding when you are from smaller Towns. I have thought several times about quitting as there’s no way we can do the bigger raids. 
I have been playing this game for a while and would love it if you added Pokémon battles like if there is another trainer near you playing it will send you and notification if you want to battle. Please add this and thanks to anyone reading until the end.
My husband and I love this game and play every day.   Just updated pokemon go, now every time I transfer a pokemon or favorite a pokemon the pokemon storage goes to the top. With over 400 pokemon it is nearly impossible to go through the pokemon to figure out which to transfer & which to evolve. Please fix!! 
Every time you do anything, select a bunch of Pokémon to transfer, evolve, or do anything, it takes you back to the top of the list. PLEASE FIX!!! It’s so annoying. Other than that I love the weather. It gives a great opportunity to get different Pokémon and to use different ones to attack at different times based on their strengths. Great idea. But that back to the top big is super annoying. Only thing making me not give 5.
Well this is a great app for 8+. Great designing of the app,A really good app for everyone 8 years and up,For an excellent example, I love this app all of the designers did an awesome job!I give you all five stars!
Hey have you realized if you delete the game and download it again you can’t login with google, and you can’t make a new acount‼️
Need to fix this!!!  I’m a frequent player.  This latest update creates a new problem: in the stored Pokemon window whenever you trade-in or upgrade or evolve and go back to Pokemon storage it takes you back to the top... wasting time to get back to the Pokemon you were working with.... argh.  The major AR update is just a battery killer that I will never use.  Niantic finally came out with some new pokemon (Thanks!).  This newest bug is a serious annoyance and a bush-league oversight.  Feels like Niantic is more invested in the new Harry Potter game than keeping up with Pokemon Go... not happy :( 
I love you
golden razzberries can catch something with like a 1500 CP but it can't catch a 1076 cp lapras?  y'all FAKE
I love this game! My teenage son and I have spent countless hours walking, hiking, exploring new places while playing this game. The new update with the weather, however, is annoying at best. My app says it’s sunny out, but it’s actually snowing. Niantic, if you’re going to include local weather you’ll need to make sure it works correctly. 
there is no update available and i am locked out of the game. i value being able to play the game, without access to the game it is useless.
Most of the time my only chance to get poke balls is when driving. I am 12, so obviously I’m not the one driving. I’m just in the back seat, hoping to get some pokeballs. But when I see a pokestop, flick the disc, an annoying sign pops up saying “try again later”. WELL I CANT TRY AGAIN LATER IM PROBABLY NOT TURNING AROUND GIVE ME THE FRIGGIN POKEBALLS. I’m not spending my money on poke coins and I can’t really defend gyms because I’m driving. Otherwise it’s a great game, but this problem takes away 4 stars. So, thanks Pokemon go. I can’t play your game
Don’t know who works there, but kudos on fixing the PGP bug. But now, when I evolve, transfer, or even select/deselect, it takes me to the top of the Pokémon list? I think this is a way to cause us to waste even more time when we have a Lucky Egg running. Not cool!
The first one is at the moment of selecting a Pokémon the game take you to the top of Pokémons again and again, that upset me because i have to move down all the time, the second one is when you open the game, sometimes the game it is freeze and I must reboot it
This game is humiliating. I still have the bug I keep trying and it still doesn’t let me play😡😡😡😡
This game likes to lure you in with the 'Free' download but unless you live close to Pokestop this game is unplayable for free. Pokémon only show up under two circumstances 1) you are at a Pokestop or 2) you are using an incense. Incense are not free so when you run out you cannot catch Pokémon unless you are at a Pokestop. In my case the nearest Pokestop is just over 2 miles away. It is not reasonable to have to walk a total of four miles just to play this game (imo) thus 'unplayable'. I give this game 2 stars because it has potential.  Edit: Now 1 star (I’d give it 0 if I could) because after all these months the game is still unplayable and clearly the developers don’t care! 
I live in Iraq and there are not a lot of Pokémon and I only found 1 gym
It’s a great game but since I’m little I miss out on stuff so I feel like kids who play should have a better advantage but overall it’s a super great game
Raid battles cheat you out of two or three seconds at the beginning and then say “Times up” with two or three seconds left in the timer...  The game locks up and then doesn’t exit properly when closed completely out...  Ex-raid system has given some people three or four passes while others at the same raids don’t get them...  Raid mechanics are heavily tilted against you...  Golden raspberry, curveball and an excellent throw, but the raid boss immediately pops out?!  Repetitive grind.   You essentially do the same thing dozens of times per day.   Everyday.   New mons don’t offer much of a challenge.   To make the game interesting and give yourself a challenge, like trying to catch perfect mons, you almost have to use trackers to avoid wasting hours catching junk over and over again.  Gave it a run for over a year, got past level 30 and just didn’t see the point anymore.   For the time invested, it just isn’t worth it. 
I love the game. I’ve been a fan since the start. But recently, whenever I would go to unfavorite a Pokémon it goes right back to the top of the list. Can you tell me what I can do?
If I mass-transfer, single transfer, select, evolve or rename a Pokémon, the list jumps back to the top every time. Makes clean-up and evolving so obnoxious that I haven't bothered in a week. This is making the game nearly unplayable. Along with the continued disadvantages Niantic intentionally built in against rural players, I'm not sure I'm long for this game anymore. Love playing and hate to see major issues remain unaddressed and new issues popping up with updates. The bugs are piling up.
Right after I transfer a Pokémon to the professor, I am sent to the top of the list (I sort alphabetically, so it takes me back up to Abra). So if I am transfering Zigzagoon and would like to transfer Zubat next, I have to deal with being sent back to the top of the Pokémon list after each Pokémon I transfer, scroll back down, transfer, repeat.  This happens whether I transfer in a group (by holding and checking multiple Pokémon) or if I transfer one by one.   I like to read the Pokémon's stats before transferring, so this issue has become a real pain. 
People in small towns and rule areas do not have the option of exclusive rades because we do not have any sponsor  stores around us or large amount of players
Since the last update, when I'm done Appraising, Evolving or Transferring a Pokemon, the list goes back to the top. This is very annoying when I'm trying to compare Pokemon. Please fix this problem. Thank you! 
I love this game, but the pokèstops always either say try again later or not in range, I hate them
The new features are great, and they fixed the bug conflicting with low power mode. However, there's a new glitch that moves you to the top of your Pokemon list whenever you transfer or mark a Pokemon as a favorite. Once that's fixed, back up to 5 stars!
move
This game has to have the worst RNG out of any game I’ve played. Trash game.
So I was doing so good at this game and I loved it but then I didn’t have anymore poke balls and I don’t have internet out side of my house so I couldn’t go to a Poke Stop so I had no poke balls so please when we have no poke balls please give us 5 or more poke balls cause I deleted the game and I just wanted poke balls but I never got them.
Greatvgame but I don’t have the AR part... ):
I love playing with my family! But PLEASE fix it so that every time you transfer Pokémon or evolve them, it doesn’t go back to the top. It is so annoying, especially as there are so many more Pokémon now.
Everytime I transfer a pokemon, it goes back to the top of the list and it's really annoying having to scroll back down.  The catch rate is also ridiculous. Low CP pokemon breaking free from a razz and ultra ball 12 times in a row!!??  And eggs... I got three Abras in a row and then three Zigzagoons in a row... Are you serious?? 
Unlike any Pokémon game to date, this one requires communication and meeting with complete strangers in order to get the very best Pokémon. Even in the cities the majority of players cheat using scanners to locate the best wild Pokémon. It’s still fun outside of the raids I can’t do but it could be so much better. Right now during the Christmas event the free drops of Pinap and Razzberries have stopped to drive players to purchase them. Profit is one thing but 1480 pokecoin for 10 pinap berries!?! I wish they would make some concessions for players outside of the city.
I don’t wanna get up and go pokemoning so why can’t we make poke stops at our house?
Fun but I think it should include a way for handicapped people to participate
Right now battling lags and is unresponsive for gyms making Pokémon battles a matter of CP vs CP, I wish they would switch to how it is in the games with turn based moves and such
Ok please  help can you do a update that everyday you get free poke balls? I ran out and and I need money for it but I need to buy coins with REAL money but my mom said no and a wild Gastly one time appeared and I had no poke balls over all this game is amazing ( news flash I just found a wild ralts!! And it’s my fav Pokémon but again have no poke balls)   PLEASE UPDATE DAILY POKEBALLS PLZZZZZ
Does not matter if I am in NYC for the holiday, or back in my somewhat rural to mid sized home city, finding people for raids is NOT a fun task to perform. Niantec needs to bite the bullet and add a search and/or form party feature (within a 20-30 mile radius?) so players can simply join each others groups before a raid even takes place, something like in an mmo but way more simplistic would do fine. As it stands right now even using discord getting meet ups to go raid is simply a nightmare, and thats really the only thing worth doing on this game anymore. 1 star for creating a game focusing on playing with others but having ZERO functionality of making it possible TO play with others......
I like Pokémon ok
THE GAME IS AWESOME!! Im waiting for new updates.
Mi Pokédex solo alcanza asta los 315 Pokémon’s
Really enjoyed this game when it first came out although my bank account says different. Every update has gradually made the game worse over time and this last update was the icing on the cake. With all the money invested in this game was the only thing keeping me from deleting it, but now every time I see the app its a sad reminder of what was once a great time. Old saying... if it’s not broke don’t fix it! RIP Pokémon.
The new AR update has me a bit mad. I have an iPhone running 11 but cannot use the new AR because my iPhone is an iPhone 5s. This is unfair to players that don’t have an iPhone or can’t afford one. What about android players??? The new AR should be available to everyone.
In the main part of the United States, such as California, there’s Pokémon everywhere. When you walk you’ll constantly find new Pokémon. It would be nice if there was more Pokémon, Gyms and PokéStops throughout Hawai‘i. It’s hard to play when there’s nothing around you. Their either super far apart, or in bunches, which is rare. Please give us more Pokémon! Besides that, it’s a great game.
Transferring Pokémon takes you back to the top
The new update is GREAT but instead of just catching Pokémon let us battle like they do in the cartoon so we can have an easier time catching harder to capture Pokémon and also let us battle random people or battle friends for coins instead of just getting coins by joining gyms
You’ve taken a great thing and slowly made it more and more annoying to play. I don’t drive, so I enjoyed playing while riding. I imagine people with kids enjoyed having something their kids could do as passengers as well. But now you can’t even spin pokestops while riding.   Then tonight this AR+ mess pops up. Look, I don’t want to stand around waving my phone to scan the area just to see the Pokémon through my camera. I do enjoy seeing them through my camera but I guess now I’m stuck with your generic background. The thing that made the AR part of this so magical is that it was simple and not irritating to use. I could quickly snap a pic while catching a Pokémon in my environment.   I do enjoy the raids and all the new Pokémon but can I ask why, with like 500+(I’m guessing) Pokémon running around I still manage to see Pidgey and Ratata 90% of the time? Maybe turn them down a little? 
Where are they??
I will make this review short. The only reason I give this game 2 stars is because of the gym cap. The gym cap is set at 50 coins a day. I have 2 sometimes even 4 Pokémon coming back after I have already reached the gym cap. Which defeats the purpose of me even putting the Pokémon, in the gym in the first place because I am not getting any coins from them. Along with the fact some body might say “oh well you can feed them berries from home” well yea true, however each berry only heals them about 15-30 hp/motivation. Here’s a suggestion maybe increase the coin cap or give a reward like potions, poke balls, or even berries as a reward after reaching the coin cap. I mean come on cause now the problem is I get my Pokémon back with nothing but have to spend potions to heal it. This feature would probably increase gym activity since players actually get another incentive to battle in gyms.
Most people cheat and mod it and the game practically forces you to buy poki balls on top of that the things you get usually you already got
I have issues trying to log in quite regularly. I quit buying in app purchases as I’m afraid if I spend any money buying goodies that I’ll end up not being able to access them. Too bad since the game was fun but I feel that these issues with logging in should have been resolved by now. On to the next game I suppose..
It is almost impossible for to go through my Pokemon and trade ones that are not ones I want to keep.  It keeps putting you back at the top, so as I go through and review many that I get in a day, this has made it next to impossible.  Also because of this I am having trouble evolving my Pokemon as I am having trouble remembering which ones I still need to evolve.  This has made things next to impossible for me.  I understand why, to slow down people evolving, but has made things unbearable.
This game is back to being addicting with all the new updates with RAIDS, 3 generations of Pokemon and the weather conditions effecting pokemon moves or how frequent they spawn.   One thing I want to see happen in the near future is to add different hair styles for the trainer avatars  AND also since the update to evolve pokemon with certain items. I have not gotten any from the pokestops. It shouldn’t be that hard to get them. I have pokemon ready to evolve to their secondary evolution option but the fact that I don’t have the special item I can’t evolve them. 
Ok I love this game it is super fun but I wish there was an online and offline feature so that most people can play without data and if you catch a Pokémon offline it can transfer to the online account.
Still no trading....
With time off work that means playing this game more with friends. Oh wait. I can’t because I’ve caught too many Pokémon so I’m forced to stop playing the game. Guess I’ll take my money elsewhere...
If you want to battle a Legendary Pokémon you need raid passes(you get one daily otherwise you’ll have to pay $1 real dollar to buy one) I wouldn’t recommend this game until they offer more raid passes daily.
When transferring pokemon, after the transfer the app brings you back to the top of the list rather than where you left off. This makes transferring pokemon based on IV appraisals very difficult and time consuming. Fix please.
This game is amazing. However i love in rural Michigan so I cannot play as much. That is also why I started spoofing, I have stopped since then but the level 3 or above raid system is really unfair for rural players because a VICTREEBELL is unbeatable with just one player which it shouldn’t be. The new legendary raid system is also hard because it takes roughly 5-20 people to take out a legendary and my community has a Pokemon trainer population of about 10 people and we only have about 15 pokestops. So I think that there needs to be a bit of a balance between rural and urban communities. Other that that the game is amazing!!!
The hype is over but I've been trying to play a little. Unfortunately EVERY time I try to play the game it says I have to update to play. Except I also need wifi to download the update and of course I'm not playing the game at home so the game is worthless to me and I'm finally going to delete it because, I can never play it.
I wish I could play this. I really do. I am a long time Pokémon fan from the 90’s, and I was exited for this. But it just doesn’t work for me. I downloaded it and deleted it multiple times, but IT ALWAYS SAYS gps not available. Even if it is, and I’m connected to WiFi, it just... doesn’t work. If it’s just me then woop de doo!
The newest update brought some really neat new features. The bonuses for the Pokémon types associated with the current weather are nice and the fact that there are more of those types of weather type Pokémon. BUUUT. We live in AZ and it is continuously saying that it has extreme weather when it’s the most clear day ever or when there is clouds in the sky. Now I know this is Extreme weather every where else in the month of December but here it’s pretty normal to be 34 degrees (f) one day then 74 degrees (f) the next day THIS IS NORMAL FOR AZ so let’s fix this glitch!!!
IF I DIDN'T LIVE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE
Dis game aint dank no more
Niantic  Please fix the glitch that takes me back to the top of my list of Pokémon every time I transfer or evolve.  It’s super annoying. 
The new Pokémon and weather effects are a lot of fun!
I used two insenses and caught four Pokémon and wasted about 50 pokeballs the Pokémon would stay in for 1 2 and rarely 3 shakes then it would jump out and run away I want insenses to work again so please work on this problem
4 black kids chased me and stole my phone because I followed a Pokemon into the ghetto
The new update makes the game worth playing. We are now waiting for multiplayer Pokémon battles.
This game would be a lot more fun if it was easy to get pokeballs. Which is why I think we should have a daily gift.
The ar when you try to catch a Pokémon seems to not work properly to wear it shows the grass but you can’t click on it.
I was really into Pokémon go when I was smaller but I can’t even go out my house cause I have no service and when I got service it just said GPS signal not found. Also, I’ve here’d s tin of people have been getting hurt by not paying attention *even it’s mostly them* but when you play the game people could target the players and kidnap them even if it’s only 1/10 of people who even know how to do that. All in all though when it works fine it’s a fun and exiting experience for Pokémon fans. Also I think you should make a version of it for people who can’t walk or are in the hospital where there’s a controller so you could walk. It would probably make them cry with joy. Plus if it’s the money ya want you’d probably make more. I hope you and viewers agree with this review. Merry Christmas!
I can’t even play it on my device
I have played this game ever since it came out like one or two years ago. People always complain about how the game isn’t good enough or whatever. Guys, the point of the game is to go outside and catch Pokémon. Not sit here and tell the developers that their game is not good enough. Pokémon go is a truly amazing game, but I think I say this for everyone, we would like to be able to trade items with other players.   Now the battle raid idea was just amazing! It makes the game much more fun and enjoyable for everyone, that is if you are strong enough to beat a raid boss. 😉  Pokémon Go is a game game you guys, go outside and enjoy it!   -Ethan1nTheHood 
Please can u make Pokémon go on ipad plz
Anytime you transfer a Pokémon in your pack, the list immediately jumps to the top.      That’s quite annoying.  Additionally, it seems that drop rates for items are ever changing.   But otherwise the added weather effects are nice. 
The new release has a new bug. In Pokémon bag when list Pokémon by name, clicked a Pokémon, then transfer, the screen went back to top. The screen used to be able to stay at the place so that I can keep select more to transfer. Please fix it.
can't transfer or evolve pokemon without it jumping to the top of the screen... it's extremely hard to evolve like 50 pidgey without wasting time on a lucky egg...
I like it but I wish it was easier to click on Pokémon. I sometimes literally have to run away and attempt to click 10 times and the Pokémon I am actually attempting to tap disappears Or that the Pokémon just didn’t generate right on top of each other or so close to each other 
Please test your updates well before releasing to the public! Transferring a Pokémon scrolls the screen to the top!
As a lifelong Pokémon fan, there is sooo much more you could do with this game to make it a more interactive game for players. There's nothing to be done in less you're out walking and from where I live I would have to walk miles and miles to be involved in any of these gyms and PokéStops it's just not realistic for a lot of people. You should add quests like one user suggested individual quests. There could be so many interesting things that you could do with this game but you made it in people liked it so it's like you decided to stop innovating right there and then no need to add anything else, and forget those people who don't live in the middle of the city they don't matter!
I really love this game but recently I have noticed that when my Pokémon come back from gyms some don’t win any coins while others do... not sure what’s going on.
In the latest update, a serious bug was introduced that impacts the Pokémon collection. Any action taken in the Pokémon  collection, such as changing the sorting, or evolving or transferring or Pokémon, causes the collection to scroll to the top.
This game definitely earns these five stars, owing to the countless memories and experiences I've had playing this game. Playing a game that encourages cooperation between players and eventually helped me break out of my shell and express myself, leading me to writing this review. This game is amazing, and definitely earns these five stars.
Areas with no nearby pokestops, like mine have to travel very far to even get far in game plz add more
-Let me call my Pokémon back from the gym -Stardust is still way too scarce (even given the newest updates) -50 coins max per day would be fine but since I lose my Pokémon for sometimes days to a gym, seems unfair -XP and/or stardust for winning gyms PLEASE -Paying for stardust boosters is lame, make them rare items at pokestops too 
I would love to support this game however whenever I try to purchase pokecoins I get hit with the “something went wrong, please try again (3)”. I’ve tried many things but none have worked. Please fix this please fellow ingress player
I love the game the new update has been awesome and can’t wait for more! I’ve just noticed that every time you transfer a Pokémon it glitches you back to the top of the Pokémon list. It’s more of an inconvenience than how it was before the update! Hope this issue gets taken care of!
Currently when transferring Pokémon, both in mass or one by one, when the transfer completes the game jumps you back to the top of your Pokémon list. That is rather annoying a inconvenient, please fix ☺️ thank you
I love this game and everything else Pokémon but the trainer club account takes FOREVER to load.
How do you call yourself a Pokémon game without trading?? C’mon. Great game a year in.
Please fix the poke list issue! It’s so annoying that you have to scroll all the way down every single time to find the Pokémon you want to rename or transfer.
Many big Pokémon go supporters are going to leave if you don’t fix this. It’s ridiculous that I basically can’t catch anything with a Pokémon anymore and I have all of my catch bonuses maxed out. The whole point of the game is catching Pokémon. What is the point if we can’t catch them unless we throw 20 pokeballs at it.
fix transferring so i dont get sent  back to the top when i transfer multiple pokemon
Viewing Pokémon details causes Rolodex to scroll back to top every time.
Where do you catch mewtwo?
GG
The EX raid pass system is heavily flawed. They say that they base raid times on peak raiding hours but I and many others I normally raid with got a pass for 230 on a Monday. Whether you have work or school this is an unrealistic time to play. There should be a choice either when you get the pass or in general settings to choose a raid time and say of the week. They could even have a sort of voting system where players that participated in a raid at a location choose when to have it within a 3 day period. Regardless, it’s very unfortunate that people miss exclusive raids due to poor schedules.
Edit: it logged me out and removed my information. I can’t play anymore on my own account, but that doesn’t matter to you guys does it? You have a clear history of not caring about the players just happily take our money  It started out absolutely amazing and everything I hoped it would be. But then the last update came out, all of a sudden everything stopped working. Pokestops no longer register, the game freezes all the time and that's if I can get it to load! Now about seven or eight times out of 10 when I try to load the game it can't get past the loading screen and now it has trouble figuring out how to login when I click on something it registers that I'm clicking on it and it makes the motion but it doesn't do anything. Any other game would have been dropped and left alone the only reason that people are continuing to play it with what's going on is because it's Pokémon. 
Omg I play this all the time. People who say it causes people to die that’s because they stare at there phone and don’t pay attention to there surrounding witch it said not to do. It’s cool with all the updates and they make new Pokémon’s. Best game ever 😀😃😃😍😍😍😆😆😆
Especially in these winter months, there is almost no way for us rural players to regularly make PokeStop runs while urban players get these everywhere they go. Please implement some way for rural players to gain access to necessary resources such as PokeStops.
I have held off on upgrading to iOS 11 because of the affect it had in the POGO+ not working properly after. It looks like Niantic has shared the love with iOS 10 after this update. This update made my POGO+ almost completely useless.
I’ve been a faithful player since the beginning and have generally enjoyed the game and appreciate the updates and new features that have come along. I’m intrigued by the new AR capabilities too.   But there’s a recent bug that is very annoying and I hope fixed soon.  Whenever you transfer a Pokemon, it now takes you back to the top of your Pokémon list, instead of staying where you are. This is very annoying and a big waste of time when you’re transferring Pokes. Please go back to old approach. 
Been on the ship since it first came about in 2016...and this game has improved so much since it originated. This is the best game in the App Store right now and that’s not even up for discussion.
A few months a ago I deleted Pokémon GO,now I decided to redownload After I heard generation 3 dropped.after I logged into my account I realized I was back to level one and I had to choose my starter,🙁🙁🙁🙁🙁Not cool Niantic.Overall fun game though and I enjoy playing it a lot!
I seriously love Pokemon Go and have played it since it first got released but I have some complaints about the latest update. You used to scroll through your Pokemon and be able to transfer or favorite a Pokemon and be on the same page of the Pokemon you're on. But now when you transfer or favorite a Pokemon it takes you back to the top of your Pokemon list and then you have to scroll back through all the Pokemon you have and it's annoying. Really wish you guys would fix this and put it back the way it was. Thank you.
Gen 3 update is glichen. Every time I transfer poke, my list restarts. Fix et
Okay I used to love this app there were no glitches, bugs or anything wrong. The game was amazing and I loved it. I didn’t have enough storage for other apps so sadly I deleted this app. Today I realized that I waned this app back. I went on App Store and I tried to download it and it COST MONEY!!!! So this is why I don’t recommend getting this app.
Your app os so stupid
This game is fantastic but the problem is in rural towns or ones that just have a low Pop. Gyms and pokéstops are too rare. I have to walk a mile to get 3 Pokéballs . I would request either adding more loot to stops in rural areas or adding more stops in general. Although cities have large numbers of stops and gyms so I would refrain from adding more there . 
I recently got back to this game after leaving it for a good while, but when I came back I found a new love for it. The game has become a whole lot friendlier to players who live in areas away from pokestops by making Pokémon appear more frequently in less populated areas. I also love the fact that Gen 2 and 3 Pokémon have been added and I hope to see many more added in the future. A complaint I still have about the game is the lack of a trading system, I personally find myself wanting to trade my collection of Eevees to my friend for his collection of Pikachus. Even a randomized trading system like wonder trade would be appreciated. I also believe that great balls should be for sale like regular pokéballs, mostly because players who live in a more isolated area can’t easily get them making capturing some Pokémon rather difficult. I still love the game and hope that it only gets better from here and I hope that eventually a trading system comes into place.
I have been playing this game for almost a year now. I live in a rural area, which, as so many other people have pointed out, makes it really hard to get a group together to do raids. And lately the raids seem to always be at really strange and inconvenient times, like in the middle of the afternoon while everyone is either working or on school. I have seen a lot of complaints about this, and, as usual, it seems like Niantic just doesn’t care about its player base. Until significant improvements to the raid system are made, such as maybe making raids easier in rural areas and not having them at 2 pm, this review stays at one star where it belongs.
You require a strong password but won’t let me paste it from a password manager. No thanks.
The update has totally changed the targeting for Pokémon. It now takes on average 15 pokeballs to catch a Pokémon. I burned through over 55 balls on my last outing. The game is now unplayable.
Niantic, you aren’t making any sense with this new update. It’s all because of one thing, login failures. In case you haven’t known, everyone has been failing to login. There is a 50% of getting this message: “login_failure_wrong_credentials” the other 50% is getting this message: “could_not_retrieve_server_data”  So, PLEASE fix this error Niantic. For pointing this out, I will take a MewTwo as an apology. 
It will not let me log in with my google account no matter what I try to do.
Since this latest update suddenly the gps cannot be found for an extended period of time. But if I use say google maps which uses the same gps on the Iphone7 it’s instant. So two different apps using the same gps and one cannot find the signal? This is sad
Pokémon go is a really fun game and a way to get people to experience the real world. but a problem with Pokémon go is that it drains the battery, so you can’t play for a long period of time. But it is a good way to get outside and explore, also, who doesn’t like little cute creatures running around!
the game is definitely better than my review a year ago. however there is one area sorely lacking, which is that rural/suburban players get shafted. which is not in the spirit of pokemon seeing that major cities were few and dar between in the actual pokémon universe. with most regions being rural and suburban.  rural areas need an injection of stops, gyms and spawns big time.  another feature sorely needed is the ability to switch teams.   also stardust acquirement needs an overhaul. game is far too grindy for the kind of game it is. 
Since the new update, whenever you select multiple Pokémon and then transfer them, or if you click on a Pokémon and then go back to the list, it will put you back at the top of the list. Super annoying :(
On the next update can their be a daily check in where every time up open the app you get something like coins and/or poke balls just to make it fair for players in rural and city places.
It seems fun though I get weird looks when I play it but when I use the new update, the augmented reality makes it harder to capture Pokémon, not easier so I am scared to use the function
I was wondering if you guys can add this feature where if you start up Pokémon GO, you’ll get a daily bonus everyday. Whether it’d be Pokéballs, Pokécoins, etc. Please add that to the app, ‘cause I’m all out of Pokéballs. Thanks. BTW, keep up the good work! 😉👍
Put trading now
This game is fantastic for city life, from Seattle to San Antonio, this is astounding for the City, but living in the country where there are still noted land marks there are no pokemon... at all.   Hey, I understand city support methods, but what about those of us on mil bases and or the rest of us in the country?   Just.. why can’t we have access like everyone else? That isn’t fair.. even with 4bar LTE not one pokemon for miles and miles. 
I like having some sound on in game, but it’s so ear piercingly loud when I have on headphones and trying to listen to my music. It’s a little enraging how loud these tones are. Another wanted feature is being able to toggle music would be nice. I miss my Halloween music. :(
Pokémon go needs more stuff like trading , battling ,seeing other trainers and there Pokémon.and to see your Pokémon buddy where you are and in a gym battle.
I really like pokemon go but there is no map for iraq
I’ve just started and I can’t catch the first Pokémon
The game is amazing... The new update not so well. This update has too many steps. Why can't we just go back to catching Pokemon instead of waiting for a bush to pop up? I love the fact that we get to get up close to the Pokemon just why hint for it??? Too complicated.
i used an inscent and was going fast apparently thats cheating
So, Pokemon games are about getting Pokemon and pitting those Pokemon against other Pokemon, right? Well this game is just that, but without the second part. Sure, catching Pokémon in the real world with AR is genius, but it gets old after a while. And the only way to battle other Pokemon is going to gyms. Now, what’s smart about the gyms is that you need to be a certain level to enter certain gyms, which encourages you to level up more by, again, getting Pokemon. Now, what I mean by the battling part of the game not being there is this: it sort of feels like an afterthought. If your Pokemon faint in battle, you’re in for some SERIOUS grinding. First, you have to get potions from pokestops so you can use them to heal your Pokemon. But oh no! If your Pokemon aren’t leveled up enough, you can’t heal them! Wanna level them up? Sorry! Nope! YOU have to be a certain level in order to level up your Pokemon, AND THEN you can heal them. This is literally the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever experienced in a video game. Granted, gym battles are optional, but if the option is available, don’t make it so freaking tedious!! Although, I have hope that you will fix these problems, because this game used to have SEVERE internet issues, and you fixed that. So please, listen to my complaints and fix the grinding issues!!
Great game. Recommend to people who exercise.
It’s great that there are so many Pokémon now, but whenever I transfer a Pokémon it takes me back to the top of the page which is really stupid and time wasting.
The app is next to useless now since it gets stuck on the loading screen every time I try to use it beyond my home WiFi range. I’m using a 7 I guess it has something to do with Apple slowing down my phone but come on.
When I transfer or evolve a Pokémon in my inventory, it takes me back to the top of the inventory and I have to scroll all the way back down. Really inconvenient
You’re game is just way to complicated
Hey Niantic I remember having more product in my inventory and when I checked, I seem to have less. Especially my rare candies. Please help. I never had this situation. I could be wrong but I remember yesterday. I did a raid and I remember I got some rare candies, along with my rare candies in my inventory, I should have gotten more. Please help and I’ll give a 5 star rating after. 
Now whenever I transfer pokemon, evolve them, etc the screen refreshes to the top which is highly annoying and not that efficient esp when you are at the middle or bottom of the page.
After update, my pokemon go plus is not working!
I really like the game I think I’m a pretty good player but it is hard for me to get more poke balls because there isn’t enough poke stops in my area #espanola poke stops
Every time you star a Pokémon or transfer it, the game jumps to the top of the Pokémon list... please fix this... it’s frustrating to keep scrolling down where you were every time you try to clean up your Pokémon list
The game is great. I've spent a bunch of money and time on it. Here are some suggestions...  1)Create lure timers.  2)Put Tauros into eggs.(They are nowhere to be found in Clearwater, FL) we have to drive over three hours away to get one... At this point... There shouldn't be a regional lock on any gen 1 Pokemon. 3)Increase the coins given for defending gyms. There is not incentive to have any good Pokemon on gyms now) 4)The instability of the game is ridiculous. It crashes, and freezes all the time. 5) This glitch where everytime you rename, favorite, or transfer a Pokemon... It refreshes the list back to the top... Making it aggravating as hell to go through your Pokemon after a long days worth of catching. 
I love the game but i have no stops even close to my house or even in my town i wish there were more around so i could get better spawns and even get more pokéloot.
Ugh this speed cap is killing me! Usually my kids play while I run my errands and now can't! 😡 it used to keep them occupied! Now they can't catch Pokemon while we go a curtain speed or get poke-balls! And I refuse to buy balls for 3 of us thats a s*it load of money I'm not willing to spend! Kids are losing interest and so am I!  Newest update has to much glitches! So annoying how when I go to delete multiple Pokémon it sends me back to the top! Even if I mistake press and hold a Pokémon it sends me back to the top of my list! 
the last update changed the Transfer action to automatically scroll back up to the top of your Pokemon list. Please change this back to remain on the same page when transfers are taking place.
The more I’ve played this game the worse it gets and it eventually leads you to the point to where you spend money to get nothing out of it. This game to me has ruined the look of Pokémon games in general just because of how much worse it gets. I will not be playing this crap anymore
niantic cheats me out of pokemon and “free” incentives. i’m absolutely tired of the legendaries i got cheated out of, raid battle glitches and errors that kept us from being able to catch pokemon or fight, and being screwed out of the free stuff that we have the opportunity to be awarded. i have spent too much money on this game to quit playing but for as much money as i have invested in this piece of crap game you’d think they’d TRY to make the players happy.
I play this game every day catching multiple Pokémon. That resulting in having to transfer them or really doing anything to them is now making me have to scroll all the way through them again. It automatically is bringing me right back to the top when I want to leave off where I am like I have always been able too. Please fix. I figure enough complaints will hopefully get some things to change here. I see I am not the only one with this problem. Please please fix.
K it’s got potential but... I CANT WALK!!! This dumb game won’t track my foot steps!!! HELP ME!!! The creator of this game needs to respond before my 3 stars become 1 star!!! 😡🤬🤭😤
I LOVE THE GAME BUT WHATS LACKING IS TRADING POKÉMONNNN, PLZ MAKE IT POSSIBLE!
Nobody want to run around in the neighborhood and get hit by a car or die so make Pokémon go you don’t have to go outside because safety palm no one want to look around to watch for freaking car you freaking Pokémon go cup me don’t understand that
Pokémon go is AMAZING! But I have ONE recommendation! To make the game EVEN better you should make it so you can have more than one buddy!!
I don’t like no trading.
This latest update and the game WILL NOT open at all!!!  With every "update" this game becomes more frustrating. A Pokémon will appear and just as quickly disappear. And now it takes 10 to 15 balls to get a Pokémon. With all the recent updates, the only Pokemon's you see are those dang pidgys and those Rats. When you throw a ball it takes five to ten throws to hopefully get the Pokemon, If it don't run away. It is about time to see some new Pokemon's. And walking to hatch eggs is a joke, as the game does not give you credit for walking. I know for a fact that my street is a mile from one end to the other, yet going to the end and back the game does not give you two miles.  I have been very tempted to delete the game. 
Make groudon easier to catch for iPhone X Less cp power please 
I have an iPhone 8+ with the latest iOS but there’s not an option to turn on at+
Can we have more different raids like steelix, ampharos, beedrill, and others.
Really up set wasted 10 pokeballs on a poke which was a lvl 389 ran away lvl 23 my little brother gets then on the first try or second game is wack they need to fix it im furious over this and happens to me all the time
Pokémon is dead now.
Hi there is a few thing’s I don’t like about this game 1.The app keeps glitching and this Happens most of the time I click on a Pokemon and it just stays and doesn’t let me catch It Number 2. It just doesn’t let you trade with your friends so Reckomend you to get the app but it’s just not my thing but I’m a BIG fan of Pokemon.
I can’t get into my account and I keep typing my password and I know it’s correct. And I don’t know my Player ID so I can’t press “Forgot Password?”
Make it possible to incubate eggs & catch Pokémon being a passenger in a car for long car trips. It’s horrible that I stare at the screen for forever twirling around my character watching him run & not one Pokémon pops up...
One time I caught a big penis like as big as a poke gym like huge man this was like as big as the earth
I caught a penis in this game
I had my weezing in the gym for I know at least 23 hours and got no poke coins for it the same thing also happened to my cousin and I feed so many berries just to keep him there 19 or 20 with nothing for the 23 hours he was there..... I want my poke coins
So I love the game in all, yeah its addicting. Some problems are that time to time it will kick me out, now at first I thought it was just a gltich so I continued playing it, but now it got way out of hand. So please fix this Niantic.
I no longer get any Pokémon that show up. Nor do I see any roads.
Since the last update, the app is not working well the GPS keeps not working right.
The new weather feature and the new Pokémon are great. Its fun to see the game interacting more with the actual world around me. It’s really frustrating, though, that after Every action I take when looking at my Pokémon, the list refreshes back up to the top. This sounds like a small thing, but it gets really tedious when transferring Pokémon, evolving, favoriting, etc. Every time I do one of those things, it brings me back to the top and I have to scroll back down. Every. Single. Time.
I absolutely love the app! I would recommend for Pokestops to work when you’re in the car because I just want to get some items while I’m sitting in the car. I also recommend when I’m in the car I try fighting a gym but as soon as I start I error out of the gym and it’s out of reach. But I still love the game!!
Let’s all be honest all Niantic gives a CRAP about is money.  They do nothing to help rural players.  I was in an area where it is filled with Pokémon and my near by list did not load!!! Companies need to start caring about their costumers instead of just money!!!! And Niantic is at the head of this issue.  So step it up
Bring trading of items and Pokemon, selling of items, and higher levels!!!
This app will never be good until you can train your Pokémon like EVERY other Pokémon game
Ok,it's a great pokemon game.But there are problems......HUGE PROBLEMS!!! If you have seen the first episode of pokemon from the 19s,then you probably know that you need to weaken the pokemon before catching it.So,I suggest you guys to make the buddy pokemon battle the wild pokemon and then catch the wild pokemon.Oh and why don't u just not make an event where u could get a gs ball or a master ball.
I’m glad the picture issue has been updated and thank you for taking your time too fix it! This update is great (except some of the raid bosses) but the only issue I have is when transferring candies it automatically scrolls back up. It would be great when we transfer candies that it’s still in the general area where I was (for ex. I transferred all my wurmple candy and it goes all the way back to gen 1)
This company is so out of touch with its player base, it’s just sad. Raids are impossible, try getting people together without using 3rd party apps. Every update adds new glitches. Can’t get enough potions to heal wounded Pokémon. In game changes that no one wants or needs. Improved the AR that very few people even use and messed up the Pokémon bag. Any action returns you to the top of the Pokémon bag, try throwing away a bottom of the list creature. I’m level 37 so I have a lot invested in the game and will keep playing, but I would not encourage any new players starting.
I TRIED TO MAKE MY ACCOUNT FOR 3 DAYS IT NEVER WORKED
I keep trying to catch Pokémon but the last tine was maybe a week ago when I caught a Roselia that was level 666 or it was my Shroomish! What is 666 bad for this game and do I have to give up my Roselia? PLEASE help me Pokémon Go or send me a bunch of poke balls or give free ones out like a daily one start with maybe 20! PLEASE! I keep crying because I can’t get any Pokémon and they keep wasting my poke balls!😔😭
Please,can u please add Google on the “sigh in” part because if not,I will not be able to enter my account!!!!!
This last update is really annoying in the Pokémon page, it keeps scrolling back up to the top of the page every time after doing any kind of selection with the Pokémon, you have to keep scrolling down to where you were.
I live in the middle of nowhere, (no big towns near me), so there’s no pokestops, which is understandable, but I never have any Pokémon near me and it’s dangerous to go too far from home because a highway surrounds my house on all sides, and I can’t drive because I don’t have my license, so my problem is that I have to have a friend pick me up or get my parents to drive me to catch any Pokémon.  I think personally you should get a fair chance of everything no matter where you live. Like, put a gym every 2-10 miles or something and make the Pokémon spawn more evenly. The reason I’m writing this is the ONLY Pokémon I’ve caught within 10 miles of me has been my starting bulbasaur 
Please have Pokémon go have change team please because I chose the wrong team and I can’t change my team
This is an amazing game but getting potions from stops... potions aren't common
Chews up battery like crazy.   Also rural players matter too!  Please fix! 
Every time I transfer a Pokémon it takes me back to the top instead of leaving me where I was. Please fix this
Love the new update with the weather and new Pokémon! The only complaint I have is every time I transfer Pokémon, it takes me to the top of the page instead of where I left off. If that can get fix, I’d appreciate it!
Every time I transfer a Pokémon or Mark one is my favorite it send me to the top of my list of Pokémon it’s getting really annoying it’s only happening to my iPhone 6 my other friends you have an android phone don’t have this problem
I still miss in the beginning when there was a one to three step system to locate pokemon. Not knowing locations of any pokemon and knowing when you were getting closer or further was a lot of fun.   For the new update its frustrating that the pokemon screen constantly goes back to the top.   One thing that might be nice would be a way to customary organize the pokemon in a way similar to boxes in the games. A regional sort would also be nice to avoid scrolling down so far. 
Noticed that there is a new bug in the scrolling feature — whenever you transfer or evolve a Pokémon, the screen jumps back to the beginning of the list. Horrible if you’re trying to evolve a bunch while using a lucky egg. Also there are still issues with speed/gps. I can be standing next to a stop and the stop doesn’t find me; also I get messages that I’m going to fast while walking. Aggravating.
This game is the biggest disappointment. So buggy I can hardly play half the time. Niantic is more worried about new content than making a stable or interesting game.   I’ll never buy a product from these guys again the way they half-assed this 
Love this game and it’s the BOMB!!! I’m only 10 but my cousins got me into this and they are all lvl.29-32. 15 14 and almost 11.BEAST!!!!!’ 
i like it a lot! but whenever i try to catch things, the moment they break out of the pokeball they always run away, if this was fixed, i'm sure itd be great
Not only do you get exercise you get to play your favorite game for free!!
This game is great but....during the winter there is really nothing to do. I also think you should be able to rename yourself more than once. The latest update there is a lot a new pokemon but i want pokemon like tauros back again!
Twice I have tried to evolve certain Pokémon and it has taken the candies but not evolved the characters
This game won’t let me play At all 
I just had a 10k egg hatch as a 2k egg wtffffff
Why do you have to have a parent sign up
niantic should had more medals / challenge to keeps players interested/active and interested!!!  Medals for  -curves balls -excellent / great and nice throws Etc etc . 
This game is awesome! Keep up the good work niantic :)
Pokemon Go was my favorite game, go to pokestops, battle gyms, and discover new Pokemon. It was great and all but then the maker of Pokémon go made an update where u have to slow down to get pokestops like that’s a dumb update but other than that I love it
I am in the passenger seat a lot and I can’t get the fake background and it made it hard to catch a Pokémon because it is hard to keep the phone steady while catching Pokémon .   P.S. I am a third grader 
كل ما أسجل فيها مايصير اسجل شنو هذا المسخره تقصون علينا انا سجلت وصار عندي أكونت لكن لما اسجل في اللعبه مايصير ادخل شسالفه عطوني الحل 😡😡😡😡
- Every time you transfer , rename or change the favourite mark a Pokémon, it will jump back to the top of the list. - I cannot find the Pokémon when turn on the AR+, not sure if it is a bug . 
The new AR + it's broken, they made it even harder to catch a pokemon.  It took me 13 poke balls to finally hit a pokemon, the lack of accuracy it's terrible.
I’ve been playing this game since day one, & it’s great. The concept is awesome, & getting out there catching Pokémon in the real world is too neat. We have blast playing.   That being said, the last 3 months playing have been frustrating.   Each new update with “bug fixes”, actually causes MORE bugs & issues, & the problems that were happening seem to never be fixed.  Examples:  One- the app regularly closes in the middle of game play, which is the worst when you’re raidng. With each update, it gets worse.  Two- if I’m out playing in cold weather (I live in Colorado & it’s December.... obviously it’s cold), & my battery is under 30% I consistently get GPS errors, then the app crashes. I’d say it’s extremely frequent & not only under 30% sometimes higher.  Three- they seemed to have changed when you are clearing your Pokédex, & delete something it will send you straight to the beginning page. This causing to force you to scroll all the back.  Four- the new AR is bogus... maybe if it was easier to use or actually worked, I’d be excited for it.   Overall, it’s far more buggy since Apple released whatever new IOS we’re on.  Thus my conclusion is Apple & niantic do not care for each as this program does not seem compatible with my phone. My friends who have androids do not seem to have any of these issues.   Please... fix the game. 
l love the game so much but i can't enjoy it in China
I have been trying for the past 30 minutes to try to log into my Pokémon GO account but it will not let me he keeps taking me to the Official Pokémon website and tell me to make an account which I don’t want to do I would like to use my previous email account
12/21/17 - After updating to the latest release, I'm no longer getting double XP when using a lucky egg... Pathetic.  Old review but still applies...Why would you have a required update for something that "fixes minor text"? Couldn't play the game until I downloaded the 235MB minor text update. On top of that, the update resets your catch/stop steaks.  Ridiculous! 
So when I transfer a pokey, the app now jumps back to the beginning of the list.  What. The. Hell.
I caught a gulpin then it said I caught a roselia
Undo it where you get taken back to the start of the pokemon list whenever you trade in a pokemon. I have to scroll back to where I was. It's taking me forever to trade in all my extras. Makes me think why am I even still playing this game
Still keeping me and my family entertained and exploring, even still being a giant battery hog  Latest release has a couple of frustrating, new interactions though: the ‘free side scrolling’ between Party, Pokemon, and Eggs screens makes us constantly over-scroll too far - it should ‘lock’ into each screen requiring a separate tap and swipe to move right or left  Also, when transferring Pokemon you’re now auto-scrolled to the top of you bag which is incredibly annoying if you’re near the bottom of your list and have to re-scroll to the bottom to pick up where you left off.  Fixing these would be a great upgrade. 
Not even a good game, the release of Pokémon was all out of whack, the freedom isn’t as it seems, there isn’t trading, nor trainer to trainer battles. The game is a joke.
Add more Pokemon. Different ones there's a lot more than 150. Add different stops. Beef it up a little put more gyms and poke stops in small towns tired of driving long ways 
I really don’t like how when u evolve or transfer a pokemon it goes back to the top, like seriously I have like 500 Pokémon and each time I gotta go back and search for where I left at, 👎👎👎
Please we really want trading. When can we expect it to be introduced???
I don't know if it's a bug or what but it jumping back to the top when I transfer or otherwise manipulate my Pokémon is making managing them cumbersome. Please fix ASAP.
Worst game I have ever played. You can’t battle wild pokemon, no NPC trainers, all you do is throw pokeballs at pokemon and battle in boring gyms-And even FINDING pokemon is frusterating. I’m 11, so my dad lets me play on his phone. But I never really go outside, so I only play in the car. And still, while in a car, you can’t find pokemon or use pokestops! And the pokemon are the same. Everywhere almost! It makes me wonder- why do people like this game? Use your brains humanity!
This game is awesome and very fun , but the customization is limited and it is difficult to earn coins, other than that this is a wonderful game.
Can you give us one master ball when we beat a legendary
Game is great just add trading and PVP and it’ll be 5 Star best app stuff till then it’s 4 Star
I love this game so much! But I really don’t like the new thing that happens when you transfer and it goes back to the top of the list. Also, if they would make it possible to swipe to different gen Pokémon that would be awesome! example: Gen 1 (swipe right) now you are on gen 2, (swipe right) now you are on gen 3. It would jut make it so much easier to look for things instead of going down a very long list of all the gens together.
Every time I view or transfer a Pokémon, it brings me to the top of the list.  SUPER ANNOYING!  Please fix it
Allow the purchase of StarDust!! Let us purchase it with coins or whatever but give us the chance to buy it in the store because it’s so hard to have a lot saved up and level up our Pokémon for the players in small towns. Please and thank you!! 5 stars after that update if you will!🙏
We play daily and at the the end of the day whenever you favorite, transfer, power up, etc and then exit back to your Pokémon list it takes you back to the top of the list rather than returning to where you left off. Very annoying. 2 stars for newest update. No other issues...
The game was fun until the most recent update with the new AR stuff. My Pokémon go plus only blinks red now and will not work. It was working fine the day before. Please fix this so that we can keep enjoying the game.
Game feels utterly amateurish and rushed to market. Integral features like the Pokemon tracker don't work, and server/login issues can make the game inaccessible for days at a time.  Initial popularity aside, this game would already be forgotten if it didn't have the Pokemon name attached to it.  Five stars because I can catch Pokemon while I walk around, minus four for the unfinished product.  Update 12/21/2017: uninstalling tonight, I don’t need an app pushing notifications for me to buy in game items. All set with that. 
The Pokémon list goes to beginning every time. Unplayable!!! The weather does not math w real life. Never!
After “transferring” and “favoriting” pokemon, it sends you back to the top of the list of your caught Pokémon every time. This makes the process go by much slower and it’s very aggravating! Please fix this!
I’ve walked to 3 Groudon tases, and I’m the only idiot who’ll walk in the snow. G’buy with your new group-based raid model. I’ve wasted enough time.
Every time I am at a Pokéstop I can’t get all my pokéballs or anything!!
Niantic is the first true AR gaming company of its kind and that comes with a lot of birthing pains... A LOT. I don’t play this game anymore because I couldn’t deal with all the issues I was having. Hopefully in due time this game will have ironed out a lot of kinks and it will be something my friends and I are interested in playing again. Keep up the good work Niantic. I will be keeping a look out for a feature or features to draw me back in.
Now there are so many problems such as when your scrolling through your Pokémon and you try to highlight one for deleting it jumps you all the way back up to the top of the listings
The game is doing so great right now, and I love the direction it is going in, one suggestion is I noticed how now that the game is optimized for iPhone X that the opening niantic screen has black borders, I would make it to where the whole screen is all white, also I noticed you updated gym badges and I think you should remove the training badge because it is no longer applicable to anything in the game. Thanks and keep up the good work
There is still no trading
Love it! New raids, lvl5 bosses, gen3, new AR+.... what else could a gamer ask for?🧐
I loved this game until the crappy thing deleted all of my progress and made me restart I’m so mad🤬😡
Hitler
With AR+ the entire interface and visuals look SO MUCH smoother than the normal game. Why can’t we have the rest of the game run this smoothly?
Please fix fleeing rate
I like to play but now it keeps saying I need to update even though I did
I have played this game since the first day and I love every minute of it
Just deleted this game.  No way I’m creating another account or linking this to my google accounts.  Screw it.  Not worth it.
Shop is completely down.  Devs please fix this.
Should be able to have AR+ on all iPhones 6 and up not just 6s and up
I bought a GO+ back when they first released, and it worked flawlessly on iOS10. Ever since upgrading to iOS11, it not only takes longer for it to pick up on creatures and stops, but it has a lag after you press the button as well.   Once that issue is fixed I would definitely give this game 4/5 stars, as it is one of the better games within the genre and has the iconic Pokémon that many players grew up knowing.   It would raise to 5/5 once a new gameplay mechanic is added that doesn’t just involve spamming level 5 raids for the new flavor of the month legendary, as that is getting repetitious in a bad way. 
If u live in rural area and want to play just youtube pokemon go ++
I don’t remember changing my username. But that’s not the point why do we only get to change Are username once I get it if it was like every six months but what if we don’t want the username anymore I don’t want mine and I would love to change it and my group all have nicknames mines lame and I would love to change it please let us change it about every six months because we’re not the same person we were when this first came out.
I am a heavy user of this game. My trainer level is high, the amount of money I’ve spent on it is high, and I’m a heavy user of the official “Pokémon GO+” wearable accessory. I delayed updating my phone to iOS11 for three months because of reports that it caused the GO+ to function poorly. Two days ago, six months after Niantic got access to the iOS 11 developer beta, they finally updated their app with improved compatibility with iOS11. Based on those reports, I finally updated my phone, and immediately found out that the accessory still doesn’t function as well as it did on iOS10. I am furious, on the verge of quitting this game, looking into acquiring a used phone that hasn’t been upgraded, and it’s all this developer’s fault. I have tolerated a lot of unprecedented incompetence from these people for the last year and a half, but this is too much. They are the most poorly managed financially successful company I have ever seen, and my tolerance is breaking. Niantic is cruising for an inevitable self destruction if they continue to be so inept at things like basic quality control and delivery on user expectations.
We’re I live I can’t find one gym or poke stop in walking distance. I should not have to drive some were to play this game. And I know your supposed to explore and all that but that should not mean i have to walk five miles to find a poke stop
Niantic only cares about trainers who live in big cities or towns the proof is in the way raid systems work
I love this game I think everything is great about it.  But with the new update, every time we transfer or favorite a Pokemon, we go back all the way up on the list of Pokémon and that’s very annoying. Is there anything that can be done??? 
After a few weeks of this game being out I wasn’t able to walk. I had just come out of the hospital because of a cancer diagnosis and they had me stuck to the bed there. When I had to learn to walk again I used this. Now I am already someone who enjoys Pokémon so I really wanted to be able to play. I’m walking again and I play everyday! This game is more than a game for me. I find it therapeutic, also I’ve gone places I never thought I’d go to just to play and catch new Pokémon! It dragged out more of my adventurous side. I do a lot of walking everyday and it has definitely helped with my depression. I’m out more instead of struggling.
The most unfair and frustrating game ever. E-raid invites are a joke. You have to wait for ages to get one and then they let you catch a stupid mewtwo. Do not buy incubators or hatch eggs. Waste of time and money. You rarely get an excellent Pokémon by hatching eggs. Go to other sources to get good Pokémon. They only are about getting your money.
Every time I open the app there are Pokémon everywhere & then they instantly disappear.
Love the game but I throw a golden raspberry and a excellent curve ball throw it jumps out first roll and it is insane please increase the catch rate.
They could have made this game so much better. The Pokémon spawn rate is low, only weak unwanted Pokémon spawn(not going to waste what little poke balls you get from the stops on weak crappy Pokémon. Evolution Pokémon rarely spawn (at least in my area.) You can’t see other trainers and battle them, you can’t trade Pokémon. They have put a dent on the Pokémon Co. name. They should have made it more like the DS/game boy versions of Pokémon but for mobile device. Smh we can only hope things turn around.
Apple Watch crashes constantly, and does not accurately record the distance you travel.   Raid battles have single-handedly killed this game. Not every player wants co-op forced down their throat, and the fact that legendaries are exclusive to raids and require a fairly large group of players to catch it’s lost what made it special. By all means keep raids for people who enjoy them, but also release the legendaries into the wild!   Rural gameplay also needs a major overhaul. Pokemon should spawn based on distance traveled, not how they do currently based on the map. Still seeing way more Gen 1 than 2 or 3, which just makes playing the game less enjoyable. With the amount of money I have dropped on this game it’s a shame they have completely ignored my segment of the player base (rural player), I won’t be dropping any more $ on this game until they sit down and make some much needed improvements that actually make the game better. Raids did the opposite. 
Love the game but making it harder to get anything decent from raids for places with few players. And I used to be able to open your app on my Apple Watch and hatch eggs while walking around or working. Now since the last update nothing works does t even show you take a single step even though it’s been active for 56 minutes!  Very disappointing and add more pokestops. There’s a few places I’d add pokestops in my town.
The game itself is great, but for the past couple months I have been getting the notification when I enter the game, “GPS signal not found(11)” I don’t know why but I’ve tried almost every sudjestion and nothing is working.  All internet settings are on and I did turn them on and then off. I am in the latest version and noting is working in the game.  All I can do is check my Pokémon and Pokédex and see how far away my eggs are from hatching.  It’s at the same status as 8 months ago.  I don’t know what to do, but if someone knows a way to fix I without screwing around with the internet settings (which I already did) please tell me
When you transfer, the game takes you back to the TOP of your list.  Very bad change.
FIX THE GPS!   Thank you :D 
1. Sorting by HP (the heart) doesn’t. It sorts by CP.  This is a long-running error.  2. In the latest version, when interacting with the list of Pokémon, every time you do something, the list scrolls all the way back up to the top and you have to scroll back down to wheee you were to continue what you were doing. Very annoying bug. 
I love these game.I play it everyday,multiple times a day.
I've got 2 main gripes about this game. One I live on 11 acres and there is not one Pokemon on my property. I walk my horses around and can't catch any Pokemon because there are none. You couldn't walk 3 steps in grass on the Gameboy and not be attacked and out here there aren't any. Two it's ridiculous how you evolve the Pokemon. The amount of candy needed for some of them is crazy. If you could buy candy or win it or find it at poke stops that would be fine but I don't want to catch hundreds of the same Pokemon just to evolve one of them. Other than that so far this game is pretty fun Edit 20160801: Removal of tracking and power saver has killed the little bit of fun that was left in the game. My battery drains stupid fast now and I'm not gonna carry an extra power charger for a game. Not gonna happen and now I can't tell where the Pokemon are that I need. I just walk around aimlessly hoping I see them. Negative...I'll give it a few more updates before its deleted till then one star 
Please add the ability to have real time Pokemon trainer battles and the ability to battle Pokémon to weaken them before capturing and a new levelling up process for strengthening and evolving Pokémon
The speed limit needs to go or raised when using the plus accessory. The decay rate of Pokemon defending a gym is terrible. Plus i once defended a gym for 15 days and only got 50 coins. That is crap. 50 coins a day or more should be the rate of reward. If not then there's no point in leaving a Pokémon to defend. Also where's the personal battles and trading we were promised? Id also like to see some Apple carplay integration as once mentioned.
GPS lags/wanders. Takes along time to load or refresh. Assassinates my batteries. Still fun when they release new stuff.
Gen 2 is not completely out and now we got Gen 3 ! Most people (including me) have yet to complete Gen 1. ! I have been a player since it came out but honestly it’s becoming too difficult to play if you dont live in the city (guess where I live, nowhere the city). I love Pokemon but before you keep giving us “more” stuffs... fix what you are lacking !
Latest forced update messed up the poke box. Now when I try to sort and transfer Pokémon’s to candy the list resets itself back to the top. It has never done this since I started playing 1.5 years ago.   Pogo+ also isn’t sensing the Pokémon’s near me unless I pair and unpair it. It also gets stuck trying to spin a stop or gym. Please revert back to the way it was. It worked great!   Can we get a global timer for lucky eggs? It’s so annoying having to guess how much time is left. This would be like watching a sports game and not having a clock and guessing when the game is over. 
I’m really out of used with the new update. One there are not any new Pokémon anywhere in my area. Two every time I go to transfer I have to go all the way back down to where I was because it takes me right back to the top and that’s super annoying. Three there aren’t too many options about looking for new Pokémon when you are able to travel very far. Once you update have better things for the game then I’ll give a better review but thank you.
I recommend not upgrading since anytime you transfer a Pokémon, evolve or even just highlight a Pokémon it jumps back to the top of your Pokémon. It is a royal pain. Please fix this!
This game is awfull, I don't recommend it to anybody with normal jobs. Or people that lives far from cities. Or people with no friends that play it. It just makes you spend your money. And if the game glitches (witch happens a lot) you loose it and the developers don't care, they won't do ANYTHING to solve it. This game is a total waste of time and money. Even one star is too much for this wrong called "game".
Where’s the AR update?
Yup.
The last update made my Pokemon list reset after transferring or staring my Pokemon.   I have 1000 Pokemon i need to go through and mass transfer and this NEW BUG is making it take forever to do so. 
The game wasted battery life and the gyms and teams kinda chased me off.  So if you want to play in a pointless color war... By all means get this game.    I don’t care if they add all the Pokémon to this game. 
The only issue I’m having with this app is with the Pokémon go plus. I had issued a ticket over 2 months ago when iOS 11 came out that my Pokémon go plus was lagging and the only response I got was that it was a known issue and it was being dealt with. I’m still having this issue and I will only give five stars once this is fixed!
The game itself is great! One problem I don't like is the teams. I think that everyone should have the option of 1 team change because when I started I chose instinct, and not realizing that a lot of other ppl joined mystic, including all of my friends. If you dont want to then please change my account, FantasticSheepy, which currently is in instinct to mystic. Also in my neighborhood, I have no pokestops, and so I sometimes run out, so it would be a lot much better if the pokestop gave maybe 1 or 2 more items. Thanks Niantic if you have listened and agreed with me.
It won’t let me log in when I use my gmail so I deleted the game and a couple months later I wanted to get it again but it still won’t let me log in!!!!
Great game on the iPhone but buggy as heck on the Apple Watch. Spotty at best.
Firstly, this game is impossible for many over 30% of players, including me. When you have to go outside for Pokémon you barely can go far for players like me who don't have LTE and have to use a da*m hotspot that practically drains all the battery of the other person's phone and makes it f*cking impossible to play if they don't have LTE and even when they do outside, they most likely won't be carrying a f*cking battery with them Niantic. Stupid-as* game don't download
With this latest update(December 19, 2017) I now have to scroll through my entire collection of Pokémon to get to where I was before I edited(or even deleted) one-I no longer go back to where I selected said Pokémon(even with doing mass delete selection).  Please rectify this issue as it is really bothersome.
I’m not sure if you just have to mess with us or what’s going on. But suddenly you take 90 percent of our revives away like it’s nothing. Admittedly we had too many, but this isn’t a feast or famine situation. If you’re doing it to try to get money from us that’s super lame. You already get a ton of money from me and most of the people I play with with raid passes and lucky eggs. Give us our revives back. Also, this latest update, every time I do something in my Pokémon storage it scrolls back to the top and I have to scroll back down again. Super annoying. Please fix.
So I’m trying to play the game on IPhone 6 and at the start it asks for Pokémon trainer account whenever I make one Pokémon go says to activate it and when I go back to do that it doesn’t work? Apart from that I will keep on trying until it does work so further ado I will expect great things from it!!
Stop. Giving. Me. Poke. Balls. I. Need. More. Potions. And. Revives!!!!!  Updated review: 12/20/17  Again, stop. Giving. Me. Poke. Balls. I. Need. More. Potions. And. Revives!!!!! Also! I keep getting a GPS error for some reason. 
It will not let me update so I can’t play because it says I must update to play but there is no update available.
This game is great, and I enjoy all aspects of it. However, there is one issue I and I’m sure many others have: not enough pokestops! I live in a suburban area, about a 15 min drive to the nearby city. This means that there are only a few pokestops near me, and none really close enough for me to bike or walk to. Because of this, I am constantly low on pokeballs! I hate having to manage and conserve my pokeballs by letting decent Pokemon go uncaught! All I ask, is that you add pokestops to places like schools, and in general, more in the suburban and rural parts of America , to make the game overall more enjoyable, and even possible, for people who don’t live in the city. If you won’t do that, then I suggest a sort of daily reward thing that gives you about the value of a pokestop each day, just so people never have to be completely out of pokeballs, essentially making them quit the game until they find the time to go to a pokestop. Thank you if you read this.
The game needs a lot of changes starting with how much it takes to get poke balls and how Easily there used and lost. If the balls could come back after missing or the pokemon escaping would be nice. And maybe making it easier to battle raids since some people aren’t available all the time.  More chances of catching a legendary as well! 
I have been playing and got back in the game for two months and at level 23 and got back in the game but it can get better and there are glitches but still it is a good game
I downloaded the new update and wish I hadn’t. Why does transferring Pokemon to the professor make everything go back to the top of the screen? Not a fan of this new feature.
Love playing, less than a million from 40...but please please change the Pokémon list back so it doesn’t go back to the very top every time you transfer or evolve a Pokémon...it’s VERY annoying.
Play everyday but since the recent update no matter how you sort the Pokémon you have when you evolve or transfer it take you back to the top. This is HIGHLY ANNOYING! I lose my place and end up having to scroll a long ways down especially since I have an extended Pokémon storage. Please fix this!
There are now more Pokémon available for capture than starting available space and it is required to pay for more. “Pokémon Storage has increased! You can now store up to 1,500 Pokémon by purchasing Pokémon Storage Upgrades in the in-game shop.” 
Now whenever you transfer a Pokémon, it scrolls all the way back up to the top of your list. Sort of annoying when you have 400+ Pokémon to sort through
The gameplay is amazing! The ability to meet and play with other trainers is awesome! And the fact that new updates have been coming out a lot lately have made this one of the coolest games for me and my friends to play! Thank you sooo much Niantic!!
I have been playing Pokémon-go for a year and half. The enjoyment I have received from playing with my son and wife as been great. It has been a great motivator for getting out and walking. Not to say it has not had its problems servers not working very well has been the worst of These. For the most part thrash have been fixed. The social aspect of the game has been fun meeting new people and playing and talking to them is great. IT NEEDS TO HAVE PLAYER VERSUS PLAYER BATTLES.
When editing my Pokémon it constantly resets and takes me back to the top of my Pokémon! It makes transferring and evolving my Pokémon a pain! Please fix!!
It's really sad I used to love this app! My old love for this game is the only reason I gave a this game 2 stars. I have looked around for any way to contact the people from Niantic to no avail. It feels as if they care very little about problems within their own community. Their website is impersonal and clinical, and I just wish to email or use a hotline to contact an actual person like other game designers do. I mean even the dreaded EA at least tries! I expected more of such a popular game.
I like Pokémon go but when I play it it’s not working they need more updates for bug fix they keep on saying gps not found my girl is never moving!
Still needs some improvements, but it's getting there.
Bug fixes on the latest version but still freezing and not giving you your streak bonuses.
What's going on with the scrolling and transferring/renaming pokemon, that automatic scroll up to the top is not a good idea, please switch it back
The game poke balls and great balls needs better catch rate
I have never found a single Pokémon where I live without the use of a lure module or incense. I live on a military base in KY, and I can’t find any Pokémon on base. If I want to catch any at all, I have to take a long drive to downtown Clarksville. I can’t rate any higher until this is helped or fixed.
I love this game  go with my friends and have tons off fun but is frustrating that  i haven receive mi ex  pass yet and some off my friends with less time playing and lower level they have receive more that two x pases
I love the weather conditions and new Pokémon. One thing did change that is annoying. When you open a Pokémon in your list, you are defaulted to the top when you exit that Pokémon instead of staying where you left off. It’s really annoying scrolling through. Otherwise it’s been great!
I hate that It battery waster
Something to possibly think about
Xoxobriella
Majority of the fun this game had at the beginning was the ability to track a stray Pokemon in areas, when you do not live by a nearby zone. I do not live by a nearby area and I'm not driving somewhere to catch one.   Until you let us track Pokemon again, this will always be a shadow of its former self. No amount of good changes or updates will ever match the tracking feature you took away. And then you force those sites that tried making your game fun again, to shut down.   I will not play this game, nor ever spend a dime on it until you fix tracking.   Tracking = more money More money = better updates and servers Better servers = more players who can enjoy the game More players = more money  Very simple math and you should be all over it. 
Now my Go Plus is always buzzing for no apparent reason. This is going to burn away my battery!
I’d easily say 90% of the time I have a fun time playing this game with my daughter. We raid, we hunt, power up and evolve our Pokémon, and we’ve come pretty far since August 2016. The only thing that pains me is how a couple updates have caused my iPad (with her account) to malfunction during many raids. The other issue I have is the concentration of ExRaid passes to specific areas...the game is very very fun, but for some of us who DEFINITELY travel long distances to play this game...you’d think Niantic would be rewarding those players (like they insinuated they’d do) instead of the city dwellers who travel 4 miles to a gym and have gotten 5 ExRaid passes. Whatever the system is...fix it. Many of us are more than displeased with the ONE MewTwo raid we’ve had in our town since it’s inception.  Otherwise...game play is awesome and the weather update is one of my favorite changes yet! 
Great game with lots of potential. But they keep adding new features without fixing what’s wrong. For example the horrible pausing and waiting for three long pulses for the Pokémon go plus. Ever since the big iOS update it’s basically a nuisance to use the plus.
I can’t tap on a mon to appraise or transfer it, and return to the same group of moms in my inventory. It starts back at the top of my list. That’s very frustrating.
Go to spin at the pokestops and it doesn’t do anything. Been like this for 3 days
Hi I would love to rate this a 5 star but the app keeps freezing up on me and I have an iPhone 5s and my friends have the iPhone 7’s and it’s literally pissing me off please fix it now
The more updates that happen the less we receive in our rural town.  We have a strong group of players, raid, spend money, only to have the game encompass city dwellers.  I thought the new invite pass for MewTwo was going to happen but it seems it has been made harder to find places.  It’s a real bummer this game won’t support rural players.
It’s been nearly three months. Fix the go plus for iOS! The missed experience, Pokémon, and items are really making not wanna play. Especially when o couldn’t use it for the double xp event. Fix it! Or at least compensate iOS issuer with some free items or something.
There is a gym I put my Pokémon in that is a 15 minute hike from any houses. Countless times my Pokémon have been knocked out of the gym when nobody is even there. This is a problem!
Gyms wont load. Pokémon and Pokestops take forever to load. Game freezes when trying to catch Pokémon that do load
The newest update has a major issue. Whenever you transfer or evolve a Pokémon it takes you back to the top of your pokestorge. This is very annoying and makes transferring Pokémon extremely time consuming. Please fix!!!!!
When I downloaded the game I got a horrible supply drops and my gun was out of ammo and that FARTIN song was playing in the background and I wasted 100$ purchasing cases. As soon as I caught a Pokémon it said Download this to get 1,000,000,000 Pokémon and money so I did it and it took me the I play Pokémon go song. Little kids don’t play this game i had to delete Minecraft to play this game
Why is it that when I transfer or evolve a Pokemon, the page goes back to the top and not where I left off. This needs to change. I can’t have to keep scrolling around to where I left off
It's a hard time founding you & it's super slow on loading or doesn't load at all plus it's stops mid cutch . When you start it , it frozen. It needs more bug fixs . Plus pokemon nintendo games for ipad.
Somehow lost my account and progress then it wouldn't give me the chance to log back in! Restarting, yeah!
Newest update freezes a lot after signing in. And every time you evolve, power up, transfer or change the name it brings you to the top of the Pokémon list. That's annoying and a horrible change/glitch!!!! You need to fix this. How can you use a lucky egg and have to keep strolling back down to your next Pokémon! Please fix!!!
Nice game,I love it
Update with the newest version. Really annoying bug I’m hoping it’s a bug at least. Every time you transfer or rename a Pokémon it always jumps back to the top of the list instead of staying where you were. Very annoying and time wasting change having to scroll all the time.   I really like the changes in the new update. The weather pattern thing is great. The button push charge move in gym battles is a huge improvement. The spawn rates have improved. Overall a really great update. However, it has basically killed any usefulness the go plus device had. The catch rate wasn’t great before, but at least it was acceptable for what it was. That definitely changed with the update. With the weather feature causing affected Pokémon to be higher cp the plus is even worse. You just can’t catch an almost maxed out anything with a regular ball. I would suggest what I think would be a fairly easy fix. Maybe have the game automatically start a catch attempt with a suggested ball instead of a regular one every time. Ie... if it pops up and I see the circle yellow I switch to a great ball. Red goes to ultra balls. Have the game/go plus be smart enough to do the same thing. I have huge stockpiles of great and ultra balls so I’d rather the plus use those to improve the catch rate. 
No complaints, wish trading was in it but it’s ok. Love shiny Pokémon wish there were more. It gives you a good thing to play when you are in the city or eating at a restaurant that is a poke stop. All I want is more shiny Pokémon and eventually maybe shiny legendaries too
I'm giving this zero stars because I can't even play the game because of the registration.It won't let me play.😡👎
The awesome Poke’mon Go Plus does not work with the new iPhone X.  I am sorry I updated now!  It has been a couple of months now!  I hope Niantic fixes that soon!
I quit playing a while back and just started back up once I moved in hopes that the rural options had improved. They haven’t. I got to go to a bigger city and it was great with stops and Pokemon everywhere. There isn’t anything within several miles of my house and not much at all in the small town i visit.
One star until we can battle wild Pokemon.
iv spent money on this game but im just done did a groudon raid got kicked out the team beat it and i didnt even get the xp or get the chance to catch the pokemon even though the raid was active it had me beat the groudon again bymself his is so stupid waste of fukn money on this fukn game
I always run put of pokeballs because there are barely any pokestops and every time i spin them they say try again
They had not released lots of Pokémon magnzone n porygon-z so what do you know about it
I would play sharing an internet connection with my son, not possible any more. Now I have to turn off my entire phone to get the app to work again. Doing a great job ruining the game
I like this game but it has some minor issues. If you are listening to music and you put on Pokémon go it will be so loud you can’t hear the music and too many annoying sound effects.
Please allow us to have stuff outside cities! frank! It's a bummer to have to drive two miles or more just to get Pokéstops. It's also unrealistic.
Pokémon Go is great and all, but my damage is WHY CAN’T I TAKE MY POKÉMON OUT OF THE GYM!!!! I have a freakin LEVEL 1020 SNORLAX BUT I CANT FREAKIN TAKE IT OUT OF THE GYM!!!! HEEEEEEEELLLLLLPPPPPPP
Overall the game is fantastic but every time I try to play it says unable to authenticate every time
Like the title says, i live in the a** end of nowhere, (approximately 50 miles away is the closest major city) and the only time i play this game is when i visit my family in the city because there are absolutely no Pokemon, no poke-stops, and no gyms where i live. Don’t get me wrong, i love this app, but there’s no point of having an app if it’s main uses are useless where you are located. I really wish the devs would add more pokemon, stops, and gyms to rural areas.
It’s just getting to my soul which is a great sign of happiness!!!🙂🙃🙂🙃🙂🙃! Butttttt...... it just seems to make me rather mad. And this is the reason:THE ****ING BATTERY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🤬🤬🤬🤬. Every time I get home I look at the time,good. Then I go to my room,check. Then finally I look at the battery,waaaaaa? This has been bugging the living daylights out of me. Please fix this bug😅😅.
I would give it more of a rate but yet to be disappointed only because there hasn’t been anything dealing with trading mating and or battling each other outside of gyms like you could on Pokémon red,blue and yellow I feel like if that was to come into play just like a lot of ppl I know says it would bring the game to great heights and maybe get plenty more people playing and trading would help and maybe poke centers and Mary’s would be awesome just an opinion on the matter at hand
Great game! Love the updates
I have an idea. When you see what special powers your Pokémon got you could make it so when you click on the Icon it takes you to a gym or something and you could see what the powers do and practice with them. Just an idea I had to get it off my mind. Bye
Ran 10k today and got credit for 2 because the watch app crashed 10-15 times.   Update: appleWatch deployment is less terrible, but still pretty terrible. Sometimes it gives you all your mileage. Sometimes it gives you none. No in between. I hope you remembered to check at 0.4 KM that it was walking your egg, because if you get to 5km and realize it hasn’t, you are going to have a bad time.   Offers to “Get Items” at PokeStops, makes you spin, and doesn’t actually give you items. Niantic should remove the silly spin thing and just give the items when it says “Get Items.” 
I got the app made a account and it wouldn’t go when I’ve put the info in. It would say something if it’s wrong but did nothing when was right.
Piece of crap wont let me catch it and darn crap wont stay in the ball wastes my time...
Recent updates have been mixed. Love the new way to use the special power in raids! But I hate that they took out the ability to purchase coins; especially considering they changed the way you can get coins from gyms. If you can’t buy coins, then make it easier to earn them! And too many glitches. Tired of completing a raid only to get kicked out or the app freezes up and I can’t complete it by even having a chance to catch it. Good start, bad updates/changes recently..
Amazing game! I've found the picichu secret SO NOW I GOT PICICHU
It’s a good game and all but I have encountered 2 things 1 plz fix this bug when you go and get a Pokestop it says try again later most of the time 2 with Pikachu, pichu and I’m pretty sure raichu the candie is called Pikachu not PICHU (Not yelling just pointing it out)
Maybe an awesome future update would feature an easier way to see all the Pokémon you have currently ready to evolve. So you don’t have to scroll all the way through and click on them all, you should be able to select “evolutions” just like you can arrange your Pokémon by #, hp, cp etc.
This game is fun but why can’t we fight the Pokémon we come across instead of relying on luck to catch it and it boring to rely on only pokefruit and pokeball so please do Pokémon in a traditional like fighting Pokémon with your starter like charmander
I love this game! But when I try to use incense I love this game! But when I try to use incense ( a scent that lures Pokemon to your location for 30 minutes) it doesn’t work I went to help center and watched tutorials but it didn’t work it was really frustrating and confusing so that’s why I gave it a 3 star rating. Please if anyone knows how to activate the incense please let me know!
I hate this stupid game first it doesn't even let you play on it second it doesn't let you sign in at all
Every time I try to catch something I get shut out of the app.
if u play this game still, what century r u in
So dosapppointed.  Can’t log back in using I’d and password.  I’ve paid money for coins and I made it to a decent level and now kicked out.
So. I'm super annoyed with the latest update. I touch the app. I see my avatar. App shuts off. Every single time. So I go back into the app and works just fine. But I hate that I have to do this 2 times in order to play. Fix it  **UPDATE** Cannot sign into account! Each time I open the app...it asks me to sign in. Fails. Then says “cannot connect to server” 
When I stated playing this game I loved it. The game is great, the design is awesome, and the detail to the Pokémon is amazing, but later on I was playing and then the game froze and logged me out.
I've been playing this game since it first came out and it's improved a lot! But it seems like the Pokémon that you can see how far away from you they are only show up at Pokéstops. Now, I am a person who doesn't have data or service so I can't walk to far away from my house, my source of wifi. So, being able to see the rough distance Pokémon that aren't at pokestops would be nice so I can estimate how far I can go before I lose the wifi. Also, I haven't really noticed how genders affect Pokémon so maybe a breeding system would add another fun and interesting element to the game.
This game has so much potential to bounce back into fame like it was a year ago. The problem? In the areas where you aren’t living in a city, there are no Pokémon but Ratata’s around. Need to increase the spawn of Pokémon in non-city areas..  with better Pokémon.
I have a few problems but they are mostly problems because of my daily routine and how I have school.   So first of all I am almost always stuck at 0 poke balls and whenever I go to stops I can only pickup a few. Then when I encounter a few Pokémon afterwards I’ve used all of them up and bam, stuck with no poke balls the rest of the day, so if I run into a new Pokémon and some evolved Pokémon I haven’t gotten yet. Well, all I get to do is sit there and be a little frustrated.   Another thing, since I ride the bus to and from school I try and pick up the poke stops along the way but ever since I came back to the game either they don’t allow you to pick up stuff from them or they just refuse to load for me. This causes a problem since the whole week I have school and then after school I have homework. Then just today a Breloom spawns where I live and it has a ??? cp and my highest cp Pokémon is around 1400 (I’m only level 20). But of coarse I had no pokeballs to even have a chance at catching it, which is very frustrating.    Also a lot of times I have trouble getting into the game, such as it will be stuck on the halfway point while loading and stay there. This is just a minor annoyance but it may be Sprint cell data rather than the actual game (Also saw the switch to Sprint thing but didn’t have the time to redeem the offer of 100$ worth of in game currency because I have just switch to Sprint a week before the offer.).   Overall this is a great game for people that aren’t too busy and are able to go and spend time farming up items at pokestops for a while. I only rated it 3 stars because personally it is very frustrating but otherwise it deserves a 4-5 star rating. 
The game works fine for me (iPhone7) but my boyfriend has a google phone and the last 2 days I’ve brought him on raids with me and he’ll get kicked out halfway through the raid and when he tries to re-enter he is unable to. This happened with a Groudon raid yesterday and just now after he purchased a raid pass with his pokecoins, he got kicked out of our tyranitar raid and was unable to join again- and at that time the timer was out anyways. It’s pretty frustrating from my perspective.
I spend more time waiting on raids to open then I do actually fighting, and who's idea was it to end raids at nighttime??? Literally where I do 50% of my playing 😡
The game takes literally 30-40mins to load, it takes forever to get an account, and is you a passenger while driving at any remotely “fast” speed, and the Pokémon brakes free, you don’t get a second chance to catch it! It literally turns to a cloud of dust!! 💨 Also, if you stay in one place for too long, no Pokémon will spawn, forcing you to move. but if you manage to be walking, load the game, and get an account, then the game is pretty fun.... unless the Pokémon won’t spawn...
This is pissing me off this is the third groudon raid I have done and each time it’s taken to poke balls and thrown to the side I would really like that to be resolved or either compensated so that it’s not a waste of time
Almost lvl 40 over 500+ raids still no ex invites hitting lvl 40 by today then I’m dun with this game and BS EX invites! All lies!
Love the game. But it glitches a lot and after two raids, my rare candy disappeared. I reached out to the support team but all they said we “opps don’t delete it next time”. Which I hadn’t deleted it. But glitches don’t matter since they already had my money for the raids. I’ve deleted items before and I know that’s a “whoopsie” for me. But this was a glitch. And others in that same raid had glitches. Good game terrible customer service
It can be a fun game, but it loses its appeal by repeatedly having the same Pokémons. New ones are rare. It’s boring to see the same few ones all the time.    Not sure why they do this, but I’ve lost interest. 
until theres a way to battle just like the game, story and general playstyle of every pokemon game ever this will stay as a 3 star rating.
The game will allow you to “cat h” some pokemons. Yo will have new pokemons to keep you on the hook. However, it’s buggy like hell.   For some reason, you can lose all pokemons that you are tracking and wait ofr at least 1 minute to get refreshed. You can atrack gyms. Good luck on capturing a gym if you can avoid the infamous Error 29. It’s kind of a daily blessing.  It’s really d*mb to wait for 2 minutes to start a raid. Some pokemoms are so easy to cacht that you can’t start without waiting some other players that do not exist.  As for the legendary pokemons, there are so legwndary that it’s almost impossible to catch them, even with a group of 10 players. Who can have 50friends you can come right now on a given location to catch a legemdary pokemon? Nobody. Legendary pokemons are just marketing tools. As for the legendary pokemons and raids, you need to wait for 
I can't even access the app anymore. I open it and it just automatically shuts. I have the most updated software too. Please fix this.
40 balls to try to catch a Pokémon and it runs!!!!!!! With this new update it has made it so much harder catch any Pokemon!
I loved playing this game my family went out to the beach and it was fun. But one day a red message popped up on the top saying "GPS signal not found (11)" please fix this honestly it would help us and you as a company.
This game was very fun at the start but got a little boring because you made it so there is less poke stops and gyms it's still a good game but you need to add more gyms and poke stops but it got better you made legendary Pokémon and then there are amazing Pokémon to find I love this game and play it every day.  It’s very cool how there is weather and depending on the weather are the Pokémon that come out more. 
I’ll be honest I’ve stuck with this game through the good and the bad times. With that being said yo continuously changing the drop rates for potions and balls is absolutely ridiculous. I’ve been playing last month spinning stops and gyms all day long and have gotten 0 potions! I’m not buying them from the store nice try though. We all see what your trying to do. Lower potions drop rates and put them in the store. I’m sorry Niantic I can speak for myself and most of my friends these type of games your playing will not work. Once I’m out of potions I’m quitting.   Secondly, the flea rate is out of control. It seems now most days my kids and I are over 30% flea rate! Some days it’s even higher then that. Do you know how aggravating it is to have one out of every four Pokémon runaway? No matter we do curveball, raspberry, great or excellent throw just like clockwork there gone. Please don’t make it so hard to catch everything. My kids are really struggling to keep playing this game now.  PS. What happened to the 10K eggs? I have hatched over 100 eggs the last three months and have not received a single 10K. I feel like sometimes you take everything that’s fun and the best achievements in this game and change/ruined it. I used to get so excited getting 10 K eggs! Now they’re gone. Poof 
Stupid app it’s saying my email has already been used and it said to say for got password I did that it still didn’t do anything and it still didn’t work stupid game do not download if you don’t want to get mad!!!!!!!!!!!!
Game is fun and usually works how it supposed to. But the weather system is off a bit. It’s currently snowing outside and the in game weather system thinks it’s raining. Maybe the same type of Pokémon results from this weather but I would think there would be more ice Pokémon. All I’m getting as a results of rain is water type, electric type, and bug type.
I HATE THIS APP!!!!!!!!
Alright so I love this game so much I play it pretty much all the time but there's rarely any Pokemon nearby or pokestops the only ones are to far from me but there's a public, a Starbucks coffee, a Aldis, a Harris teeters, and a bojangles all nearby Pokemon go if you're listening please put more Pokemon and more pokestops near eastfeild roads
I’m always excited to get out with friends and catch and raid Pokemon, but there is way to many bugs. Many more bugs have recently been implemented through the battle party system.
So when the update released raid bosses, I thought I would play it more.  I have tried so many raid bosses, wasted endless poke Coins, and guess what happens? It kicks me out, and that's garbage.  The majority of times I have tried raid bosses, it says error, and boom.  There goes my daily raid pass.  Niantic, you RUINED THE GAME
I love the game but wish they added trading like they did in the new Pokémon game ( Pokémon ultra moon and ultra sun ) Like maybe add wonder trade and link trade to Pokémon go 
I tried doing one for the new groudon raid and used a raid pass but each time I tried it said that I "needed to be closer to the gym" even though I was literally right next to it. And the worst part is that I tried it like 20 times until it ended and so I just lost a raid pass and a legendary without a chance to even catch it. I mean I know I get a raid pass every day but finding legendarys are difficult to even find. So please Nintendo can you fix this...
So my fiancé and I used to have poke dates and walk around doing this. I've had the app literally since the minute it went live. He got locked out of his account cause he can't remember the password and email. Yeah I know his fault. But since the last update it finally opens and doesn't show anything at all. Not even my character. He laughs cause he doesn't want to play anymore, but I walk almost 3 km a day to work and and back so I always play then and it's not working at all for me. Please fix your bugs.
overall I think the game is great the only problem is when type my info and password in it waits 10 minutes then says "Unable to authenticate" i don't think there's anything wrong with my phone because my dad has the same problem with his game so please if you could fix it
Fun game. Wish there was more to it and more to do. I wish you could add more to do but in a good way that won’t ruin the game. All my past reviews have been me ranting about something that has been fixed so I’m making this one short and to the point.
True Pokémon’s nothing like it use to be on game boy!!
I love this game. When it first came out I was going CRAZY. I love Pokémon and always as a kid wanted to be a Pokémon trainer and this is kind of like being one so I was really excited.
Buddy Pokémon, what’s the first thing that comes to your mind when I say buddy Pokémon... heart gold and soul silver. You know those Pokémon that follow you, and that’s exactly what I want ( I want your buddy Pokémon to follow you). If you are listening Pokémon please make one of my favorite things from H.G and S.S and put if in this already amazing game. I really don’t care if you walk around with a 2 foot groudon or charizard either. but please just let your buddy Pokémon follow you. Overall Pokémon go is one of my favorite games of all time and this idea will make it even better. go instinct.
I like the game and all but please do not send me notifications about getting poke coins for switching my phone carrier, talk about intrusive and annoying, keep doing it and I’ll quit the game isn’t that good anyways, raids take too much effort to get people together and the appraisal system in the game for the Pokémon’s stats still makes 0 sense to me, this is a casual game to play at the airport at best needs a lot of work after all this time.
It just says can't authenticate
Pokémon go is amazing but it would be a lot better than now if there was trading
Every time I try to get new items from poke stops, It always says,”Try again later” it’s diving me crazy because I’m out of poke balls and I can’t get anymore!!!! Also, we need unlimited normal poke balls!!!🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Game used to be fun.   Initial startup time is ridiculously slow... especially if I go out of the app to answer a text etc, it restarts the whole thing...  GPS doesn’t work anymore   Raid stinks, isn’t possible if you're solo and makes you feel like a loser.  Way to go taking a game for nerds and making them feel even more like losers who don't have friends... 
The app and game are great, wonderful if they fix the continual glitches, crashes & item issues.. balance would be great, I don’t need a thousand revives, but more than 1-3 in 30 stops would be great.   The watch needs some serious love though. The app is great for stops & egg hatching, but you can’t catch! People with a $30 gizmo can do more than those of us with the watch, I don’t want both, I want this to match what can obviously be done. 
Pokémon go is super dangerous and stupid
There needs to be more ways of teaching Pokémon new moves besides evolving them. Technical machines should be made a usable item in this app. The purpose should be to use it on one Pokémon and they learn a new move that way.
With each successive update since it's original release the game runs worse and worse on their servers. It is now at a point where the game takes forever to boot up, and it freezes and crashes literally every few minutes. "Network Error" messages constantly. Niantic is clearly spending a lot of time and energy making enhancements to the game concept, but seemingly doing nothing to enhance their technical capacity to host the gameplay. It's too frustrating to play at last. Will move on to other things.
I really enjoy playing this game. It has been so much fun to meet people because of raids. That being said it is hard getting a group of people for raids in small towns. During the duration of legendary dogs for example in a small town we only were able to complete maybe 5 raids for legendary during the month. It is even harder now that the raid boss doesn’t stay an hour but only 45min.
The app doesn’t correctly read my location and sometimes it doesn’t even pick up my location at all, while all my other apps that use location work just fine.
"Unable to authenticate" doesn't have a fix for IOS. I hate all of the stupid people that made this game just for people to be angry. F*ck you guys.
I got to say I love the new updates and what not, but please Niantic allow more absol raids. Hardly any of the tier 4 raids in my area of Long Beach by the Pike are ever absol raids. I still don’t have an absol. This is ridiculous how the absol raids show up the least out of any raid. I will be sure to come back here and give the game 5 stars once I see a lot more absol raids.
This is a really exciting, fun game. What I am concerned about is how the poke stops say there is a rare Pokémon, but when you go there, it doesn’t come up and “flees away” I saw a snorlax near a poke stop, but I got there hoping to catch it, used an insense, and nothing popped up for 10 min. Same thing happened with a syther. I thank the creators of this addictive game that I actually look forward to everyday. It is about the only game I play.
I love this game but the game got rid of one of the things that got my friend a NINETAILS!! I think the feet they had at the beginning of the game were so important to me and all of the players that started at the beginning. So I want the makers to bring them back!
It won’t let me play I have to deal with the password it says it’s too easy but I’m like 🤬 this it’s for me no nooo they say it has to have symbols but like 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
I have played Pokémon go since the beginning and everything it's been perfect till the past month. I cannot raid or battle anyone, the app just freezes or it kicks me out. Please help me Pokémon Go?!?
I had a legendary and then turned it of   And turned it back on my account was wiped clean
I play this everyday and when I go to battle at my regular "Pokémon" gym, the app freezes or closes. Fix fix fix
Give us the new update  You are the best people ever for making Pokémon go  I love you because you make Pokémon go happen you made Pokémon go hell 
Most people are not up and playing till around 9 am yet u start them at 524 in the am?
The errors show up so often now and caused app to freeze.  Each update causes the app to be unusable in US for days before the update is available in the US. 😒
Can we please get an update so this awesome game will actually load and we can actually play it?? Thanks.
Played it for a bit when it was new, but there wasn’t much to it.  However, when it put up an alert the other day saying you could get free PokéCoins if you switched your phone service to Sprint, this app got removed - permanently.   Such behavior is totally sleazy and unacceptable from an app.
Wild are fun to catch and all but it would be so much cooler if we could battle them just like in the games I’m still loving all the pokemon in this app and love the new weather update I was a little freaked out when I spawned in and there was rain and clouds but it’s still super cool hope you take the suggestion
This game is so much fun and best with friends and family, but I don’t get this. Like only 50 pokèmon from generation three, why not add all of them! Let’s not talk about the legendary pokèmon! Like only for a limited time only! This is a big problem for me and other people that live in a town that has little/none gyms. And that the problem for people that they want to have all the pokèmon in the world caught. I highly doubt that we will NOT getting mew. And also you have to go to places over sea to have a fair chance to catch, for example, Mr mine. Please fix this problem before you lost everyone who loves this game.
Really? A pop-up message from this app telling me to switch to Sprint? Employees of Sprint stole my identity when I was a customer, so there is no way I’m switching back to those jerks. And since you’re now pushing ads to me, I’m deleting this app. Sayonara.
I CANT EVEN SIGN UP!!! IM SO MAD I DONT EVEN FEEL LIKE WRITING A WHOLE REVIEW RIGHT IM JUST SICK ANS TIRED OF THIS!!!!! UGHHHGHHHH!!! ITS A NIGHTMARE!!!!!!!!!!!
I love playing this game, however recent updates to iPhones have caused the game to be unplayable unless you are connected to WiFi. When can we expect an update to fix this. It has been more than a month without being able to play normally.
Can’t log in even looted out my account still can’t (f) this game
I get that Pokémon Go does not calculate steps continuously, but I ran about a mile and got 0.06 km added to my eggs. Really? That’s about 60 yards for the mile I ran! This has to be fixed. The game is far more obsessed with preventing a miscalculation that awards the player more steps that it prevents the player from getting the steps they deserved! Very ridiculous (And yes, I waited for the game to fully update my step counter)
This game is awesome!  Though people think I’m weird playing this game, I don’t care what they think because I love Pokémon and I love this game.  Though, in this game I saw a really annoying bug. Sometimes, the game would act weird and make all the Pokémon disappear for a couple of moments. I hate this because I live on a corner where a lot of Pokémon are and almost every time I go there, they disappear. And this is not because I was going fast. I really hope you can fix this. But other than that, I ABSOLUTELY love this game!!!!!!!!
Between sporadic server issues that are still ongoing from launch, ingame bugs that have been neglected and a peripheral device that costs ~$30 that no longer properly functions on iPhone devices (a known issue since early October when ios 11 launched) and has connection issues with android phones I can not in good conscience recommend this game anymore. The gameplay is fun if its your thing but Niantic’s neglect is really starting to wear down the enjoyability. Plus Depending on where you live and who is playing the community you'll encounter may or may not be toxic.
Is anyone else having problems where the GPS isn’t working when you’re outside??
I can’t get enough Pokémon go at all!
you can not get her
I love but I want to see the rest soon
Don't waste your time with anything Pokémon, this brand has slowly deteriorated over time and every new game, update, or service is another step backwards. This game made by niantic is a glorified step counter. Trash gameplay all around and not one update has redeemed this lost cause. If I could rate it 0 stars I really would. I don't know why I wasted my time downloading this game again, hoping it might be better.
Can the new nanny feature be optional? I’ll gladly click some agreement box and assume responsibility for myself. Walking around my neighborhood looking like I’m recording everything is getting old fast. Also after 5 minutes you have to hold it tilted toward you to avoid the screen blacking out. I like the idea, but it doesn’t work, it’s just frustrating.
Could we please get better spawns? I was so excited for the weather implementation, I thought it was going to be a good change, but I got was the same 10 Pokémon with spirals around them. With gen 3 our now, can we make some of the better gen 1 Pokémon more accessible. Especially for the people who are casual players. Also the issue with IPhone update and go plus has still not been addressed. Those who have it have paid extra money for what  is now just frustratingly nonfictional.
Fix the log in issue
Hey I’ve been wondering about a new Pokémon maybe you can just make it?
I love the game and it offers a lot meets a lot of expectations and more BUT when it comes to smaller cities/towns I feel we kind of get shorted our poke stops and gyms etc are far apart compared to the bigger cities . I feel it would be nice to have them the same as bigger cities instead of having to travel bout 2 miles to a pokeStop other then that I absolutely love it .
I keep getting a ! On my weather and it’s saying that Pokémon don’t like this area but it’s perfectly fine were I live but maybe because it’s hot in California but I still would like this problem to be gone because it’s getting on my nerves
Why do we have to move in real life. I wonder if you can update the app😫
You partnered with Verizon, Ajit Pai is a puppet to Verizon. Ajit Pai is KILLING NET NEUTRALITY. Fun game, but I cannot support it anymore.
I got the notification about the pokecoins but for some reason I’m already on sprint but I don’t get anything does that count as me getting coins because I didn’t get any. Also if it does my in game name is Topbow1
They started pushing notification for free pokemoney if I switch to sprint. Not cool.
I live in a small town and I have to walk over two miles for just one Pokemon to spawn in the same place every other hour. Please update to where more Pokémon appear. When this game initially launched I could catch one in someone’s house now I can’t. Please fix this.
The new partnership with Sprint concludes that if you switch to Sprint, you get $100 worth of PokéCoins. That’s cool and all, but what if you are already signed with Sprint, like me? Then you can’t get your PokéCoins, and that is unfair.
They’re using notifications to send you spam now. I will not switch carriers for Pokémon micro transactions.
such a good game! 5/5!
It’s one thing to push EX raids to sponsored gyms, it’s completely another to start sending out push notifications to your user base urging them to buy Sprint products. You don’t see Netflix urging users to switch to T-Mobile. Using this app is starting to feel pretty gross.
You guys still need to fix the weather crap. I’m in Glendale,ca and it always says extreme weather and I live in Burbank but it’s clear over there how does that work it’s right next to each other and the sky’s have beeen clear. Fix it please
I bought 20 pokeballs just to catch one pokemon and the pokemon escaped every single time. I used more than 5 berries on it as well and I didn’t even get to catch the Pokemon after running out.
Like the update by it has glitches like the weather it’s snowing outside right now and instead my app says it’s still high winds and it’s been snowing a while there’s an inch of snow on the ground come on guys what’s the point if it’s going to be wildly wrong
Basically all you do is this game is do one things and that is to get 10k eggs because you never find anything good when your walking around. I have over 1000 hours played and i haven’t found anything other than ratatas and pidgeys. If maybe there was increased odds maybe it would work. The micro transactions don’t even work for me half the time and i end up wasting my money because I never get the poke coins. Every time a try to catch a pokemon my phone freezes or the pokemon runs away. If I would rate this in numbers it would be a -10/10.
With a list of bugs to fix Niantic released weather effect instead of fixing bugs. The weather where i live is the same day in and day out, so all we see are the same ground, fire and grass types. Haven’t found a pidgey, eevee, Nidoran or rattata in days. With the weather boost these mon are impossible to catch. It’s funny how we are 4 months into beta testing Mewtwo and 0 beta testing for weather, a game breaker.
This game was fun, I’ll admut it, BUT, one day, IT happened, right after gen 3 cam out, I just caught a powerful Mudkip and the game crashed, no big deal right? Well, now it won’t load, it will fill the bar and then freeze my whole phone until I shut it down, please fix this, I loved this game!
Let the event pikachu be transfer because it wastes space in the pokemon container thing. What ever just fix it.

12/10/18 - After several major updates, STILL huge disadvantages for rural players.  Huge.  The weather function is an awesome concept, but the weather is almost always “extreme”, even in mild weather.  They should fix the disadvantage to rural players, and then look to creating new features like trading and friend-to-friend battling. 
Overall this is a good game.But you need to make the gen 3 spawn more.All I ever see is gen 1 and 2.Not much gen 3 you need to get rid of gen 1 or make the spawn rate less and put gen 3 spawn rate more.
I am very upset when it comes to the Ex-Raids and how to get them. I have done many different raids all over where I live and I have yet to get an invite and a chance to encounter a Mewtwo, who is one of my favorite Pokemon. They really need to get a better method to do these cause the same players seem to get them and others do not. Fix it Niantic cause I’ll be very upset if I don’t get him...
The new update is awesome but the weather feature is really messed up and confused. It’s sunny and nice today so I don’t see how anything is dangerous, it needs fix asap
Gen 3 is nice to see but why do feature updates come with backtracking of bugs you fixed one version ago?!   Loading was improved in the previous version, but now it takes three times longer to start up the game.   PoGo+ response time was slightly improved one version ago, but now it’s back to its super slow response. Plus the catch rate tanked!   You need to hire more dev testers to find the bugs before release, and give your team time to fix them. These bugs cripple the user experience and cause nothing but frustration.  And let’s not even get into the completely lame roll out of the EX raids. 
Love the new Weather system, although it isn’t the most accurate. It will say it’s partly cloudy but it’s really snowing. Still waiting for trades and PvP battles.
Btw, watch GMM on YouTube
I was playing Pokémon go and checked the weather everyday all the app says the weather is sunny and it shows different weather
This is an awesome app, but for some reason, it won’t load my data to the game server. Who knows how to fix this??!!
I was messing around on the app when it said I bought a pair of skinny jeans. I DID NOT make the purchase. I want my coins back and make sure to have users CONFIRM PURCHASES. My username is Vipes2016 so you can give me a refund.
I LOOOVVVEEE this game, been playing for a long while now! Just met up with some people who happened to be at the same raid I was at, and it was such a great experience! The one thing I would change about this app is the ability to interact with the world around you IN the app. I would love to add someone I just played with, and be able to set up times to meet for raids or even just go hunting, and it’d be a really neat feature to be able to see and message players around me.
I live in a town of 50,000 people.  We have 35 gyms.  We have a very tight knit and active raid group who are all linked together on discord.  We raid together all the time.  Many have a system where they make sure they have raided at every gym once a week, or once every two weeks.  We all have many gold gyms.    The last ex raid pass distribution for Dec 18th missed >90% of these active players. The December 18 th Raid may not even be successful because so few people were invited plus they are all low level.  The lottery picked level 32 players.  None of the level 39 players, none of the level 38 players.  I don’t know of any players above level 35 were picked.  What gives?  Need this fixed ASAP!!!! 
okay so right now i’m in an area that has a high fire danger watch and a wind advisory because of high winds and dry conditions, and because california has several fires going. but this watch makes the game believe that we are having extreme weather conditions and the new weather system appears to make it sound like pokémon spawn less in these conditions. now i live here, i can tell you it’s a nice (cool) sunny day, but i receive no benefit from this because a fire watch and a wind advisory that anyone actually living here could tell you is not that severe. all in all i love the game, but this update need work so everyone can enjoy it
Pokemon go is a app of CIA, when you accept the terms and conditions of the app. The government system has access to your photos books, personal informations, and your camera and your audio. If you don’t believe it, search in the google you will see it. OK? Good Bye!!!
My phone says I can’t use the google part to sign in and when my boyfriend signs in to switch to my account it won’t let me try even thought he signs out and is right beside me can you contact google about this?
Game content is great, but the bugs need to be ironed out much sooner than they are most of the time
Plusle and Minun kinda need to be together... I mean that’s how it always is...just saying.
I think we should be able to have more than 300 Pokémon without having to spend money. It should update to match the Pokémon that are out
I honestly love the game, but the fact that I keep getting the "location not found" error with my location on and connected to wifi constantly is annoying. My avatar also does not move with me at all anymore. It's great when I am at college, since I have more pokestops here and more variety in the spawns, but I am from a urban area where the closest pokestop is in town, so I can't even see it on my phone unless I am in town. When I am in town, however, thanks to the stupid location error I can't get anything anyway. These bugs need fixed.
I like the game but would like to see the ability to battle against other players
I hate on how it says you can play this game with the IPod Touch you can go in it just can’t move you would have to be in a popular area to get Pokémon in one spot so I wish this game was a working game for the iPod
I love this game more than I could even say, Gen 3 Pokémon are finally here! So happy, but there is one small thought that always pops up in my head, will there ever be more hairstyles added in? Or even some shoes, pants, and shirts that we don’t have to buy? I mean it would be cool to have more options.
...
I normally don't leave reviews or haven't played the game in awhile but decided to check out the game after the update and I LOVE the weather feature especially the kite logo for when it's windy and the snow animations. I hope when the weather gets warmer lots of people will be out and enjoy this masterpiece
My god guys you are so bad to be in thouch with players...
The extreme weather notification is going to make it impossible to play in the winter, can’t even play while indoors.
i dont know but every time i gonna fight on a gym it takes me out of the gym and said error 26
Now it doesn’t open right away and still the same same same
Ok so first off, I am not a Pokémon hater, instead I am a Pokémon lover. But the app did not let me in even after creating an account tried and tried, but it was not letting play...
After the release of gen 3 I swear the glee rate for all pokemon has gone up. I lose probably every 3rd pokemon I try to catch now. The game has become stressful and less fun. If you’re going to put new Pokémon in your game you should allow the players to CATCH the Pokémon.
It's a great game. So much fun. I just wish there was a way to transfer your Google account to a different gmail or sync it with a trainer club account. I signed up with my school email when it first came out, not realizing the email could possibly be deleted in the future. I don't want to lose my years of progress and I definitely don't want to start over now so what do I do? Please consider this.
Horrible update! Very laggy and unresponsive. I’m swiping left and right and nothing! Never did that before until update.
The newest update seems to have broken GPS a bit. We have a gym at my work and spend a lot of the day fighting over it, however none of us can get a GPS signal now unless we go outside (even if we're on WiFi). Please fix.
I love the game but the nearby thing shows the pokemon are right next to me no feet but there nothing in the facinity
I’ve had this problem for a while. The all only actually loads the Pokémon and Poké Stops about 30-40% of the time. I then have to hard reset the app and try again. It’s been rather annoying.   But besides that, it’s a pretty great app. Only app game that has managed to keep my attention and loyalty. I’m just holding the one star gets some attention.  (It’s actually a four star game) 
I’ve been playing this game since the day it came out. The concept is great. However they don’t think about small towns with less people. It’s near impossible to get a group big enough to take down a legendary in a raid. And if you manage to defeat him you have little to no chance of catching them. You lost me, I’m over the frustration.
It’s stupid how am I gonna get coins
Would be a great game if it worked even half the time. Every time I use an incense and log out I can't log back in. Garbage save your time. Absolute trash.
This is a fantastic game. I love the new weather update, but why is it saying that there is extreme weather? I don’t get any bonuses because of it. It is currently a nice sunny day and it is saying there is extreme weather, please fix this!
Iv been a big Pokemon Fan since it came out with the 1st TV series and in the card game collection back when I was in middle school. And this game brings it all back for me 😃. And now Gen 3 is HERE!!! My personal Favorite. Along with weather in game that looks amazing. Though I may never see snow down here in South Florida🤣.   And the achievements is a good setup that most of them give a % of a higher catch rate for completing them. And finally love the (GO+) it makes it easy to play and discreet while at work
I think you should be able to walk 6 different Pokémon at the same time. PvP should have already been in here too. I would like trading but that would be too easy.
This died like 2 years ago looooooooooool
When I'm on the bus to school, there are a few pokestops on the way, when I try to spin most of them, it keeps saying try again later, living in a place with few stops already makes the game kinda hard to play when you only have 2-3 poke balls every day
This game is awesome but every time I'm home & try to play it 85% of the time gives me problems & says "GPS signal not found" I exit & open the app various times & it's the same! I restarted my phone, put it on airplane mode & pretty much tried everything but it doesn't work! FIX THIS PROBLEM PLEASE
iPhone 7 latest update..   fixed shutoff issue but now game freezes frequently. Mostly as I’m catching Pokémon, other times when I’m trying to get into gyms. 
I like this game a lot but I would like to see you add more then 1000 Pokémon the bag is small and I would like more then 1500 would also like to see the coins per day increased and please add more revives to the pokestops
I really enjoy how the weather affects the spawning of Pokémon and not location it is really helpful getting those Pokémon’s you rarely see. This was a great update keep up the great work Niantic
I want there to be a joy stick
When there is a holiday they should add clothes about the holiday and they should start adding clothes to Pokémon
I would give the game fine stars, and happily change my review. If the fix the update for the game. The new update it made it so much harder to catch Pokémon. Today it was sunny and clear, so with the new update plant, ground and fire Pokemon got boosts of power. It now two to three times as many poke balls to catch the same Pokémon as it would before. I burned through dozens of poke balls to catch half as many Pokémon
I’d re-download this app if the developers added in PvP. That’s literally one of the only aspects missing to this app.
EVEN BUGGIER and barely works bc it's so slow :(
Started playing from day1.  Quit playing when realized the gps hackers were cheating like crazy.   Started playing again when new stuff came out.  Loved the changes.  But,,,,,, the cheaters are still going strong.  Taking gyms in the middle of the night by spooofing and not getting caught.  Even when you catch one and turn them in, they go buy a lvl 30 acct on Amazon.   Also, can’t do any major raids unless I travel to a college town or bigger city.  Not near enough stops or gyms for us rural players. Have pretty much stopped playing.  Too bad, cause I really like the game and was spending real money here and there. 
Some people will stay with this game but, I highly advise you to stop playing. Niantic... is not a good “company” they have yet to get back too me about issues I have. That’s one problem I have a “real company” will get back to their players. And the raids are absolute crap I tried going into a T-tar raid and it wouldn’t let me battle him. And when I tweeted niantic support and niantic labs about the issue they never got back to me and it still happens. And when I had a problem with the release of 3rd gen, nothing would appear and I still have yet to get a response. The idea was an amazing idea but it was pitched too the wrong “company”
I live in NYC and I'm pooor so I don't have time to be traveling to get these regional pokemon like minun and seviper how would i get these ?
This has been my favorite game since 2016 and for years more
This app is great and all BUT STILL CANT: -Battle and trade with other players -no pokecenter  Its been a year, no big changes. 
Don’t play it’s a waste. You’ll never get an ex raid pass and if you do odds are after months and months you won’t catch what you want. Play something else
I love this game, but I think it would be even better if you guys added trading. I think it would be really fun, some people have Pokémon that other want and vice versa it would get people to interact more with each other and make it more fun.
There is a bug that no pokestop works and I am out of ultraballs and great balls and pokeballs
I get that some Pokémon with higher stats are harder to catch. I’ve played this game since day one and have dealt with the struggle sometimes of needing to use a berry and 2/3 balls to catch a stronger pokemon. But ever since the most recent update where Gen3 and the weather was added it’s gotten beyond ridiculous. Multiple berries and 4-8 balls on avg per pokemon and that’s including weak low stats pokemon. Its so inconsistent and It’s seriously not cool.  Just for example time and my wife went out this morning and hit some gyms and stops. Multiple times a Eevee or a Bulbasaur with like 200CP took 6+ balls/2+ berries to catch. That’s ridiculous. Then 15 min later a 1300CP pokemon stays in on the first ball? We get it you’re trying to make it so people run through balls quicker and then spend money to buy coins to buy more balls. I refuse. I’ll just hit more stops and get em free before I put another penny into this game. Fix this crap and fix the error code crap. Oh and btw the Ex-Raids or raids in general are beyond biased towards big cities with a lot of people. Try living in a small town and getting a huge group together to battle some of these raids like Ho-oh. Fix your crap Niantic 
Ok so let’s say your at home sick in bed and you can’t get up but want to play Pokémon GO. Now I say they add a Pokémon GO game that has a joystick so you can sit and not walk around but still get to play.
It’s been snowing for hours here in metro Detroit, Michigan and my weather on the game is still partly cloudy?!?!  I’ve refreshed the app and restarted my phone and still not reflecting real world weather conditions like the newest update claims it does :( 
Pokémon fi should give discounts at a certain level at this poke stops or hotel! Get back customers. Anyways i love this new updated weather
Probably the worst excuse of fitness Pokémon go is also a target of murders and accidents and plus it get boring when the only Pokémon you will find is weevil or carp overall dumb
The day before generation 3’s launch, I had the option to buy pokéstorage and I did buy it because I needed space. I was at 999/1,000 but the new generation launched, prompting me to buy more storage. I bought the storage, then checked if it got added, and I never received the storage. I would really appreciate a refund of merely 400 coins. I would not be requesting a refund if earning coins was easier but, living in a rural area is tough, and the “50 coins per day” rule does not make earning coins easy. 
For the most part the recent update is fun, the problem is the extreme weather function is way too sensitive, maybe that function could be turned off in the next update. Example: here in Kansas the weather is sunny but dry so we have a burn band going on, the  extreme weather setting was activated.
So I wake up yesterday and open the game to see that the 110,000+ stardust I had somehow vanished overnight and it’s down to 1,000, and this is the 3rd time this has happened, I have been a loyal fan for almost 2 years now and have grinded my way to level 33 115,000 xq away from level 34 but this is unacceptable, I am deleting the game, don’t know if forever or just temporarily but I’m very disappointed
Garbage! 😂 Who plays stuff like this?!?
When ever I run out of pokeballs something good shows up
I love hacking the game still. December 2017
Game works will  but  when I  catch Pokémon I can see   The camera in  real life
I love pokemon! Everything about it! But one small problem THIS IS ONLY ON PHONES AND I HAVE TO WAIT INTILL IM 13 TO GET A PHONE!!!!
R u guys still playing this game? It’s dumb
I am getting extreme all the time - not during a snow storm, mind you.  But any ‘special weather statement’ that roads might be icy, this incorrect ‘Extreme’ warning shuts down the weather bonuses. This is normal weather! Glad I don’t live in VT.
Ya
Wow the weather feature was a nice touch, it’s making much better Pokémon appear in my small town where I’m the only player, not even a Gym here. Please add more far spread Gym’s, Pokestops, and Pokemon diversity (its 2017 you pretty much have to be diverse). Keep doing what you have been doing but don’t forget the little guys please.
Could use more pokestops and gyms in rural areas, seems like city players have massive gameplay advantage.
Decent game but unless you live in a major town good luck playing. I live on the outskirts of Colorado Springs and there’s no Pokémon around me. I’m not even in a rural area and don’t see Pokémon. This is bs. Fix your game or keep losing players.
I have been a pokemon fan almost all my life. When this game was announced I was ready for it. Sadly my mom didn’t let me play it because she didn’t want me to “die” but know that I am older she let me play it and let me say I love it! It is such a good game. There are some thing that need to be fixed but that beside the point. This is a beautiful game and it needs to stay that way.
Two features I’ve been waiting for! I know people got caught up in the madness of pvp and trading but the ability to save teams and now have weather effecting the game is laying the foundation for something big!  Nice job!
When I play Pokémon Go the weather always says that it’s extreme when in reality is clear, parshaly cloudy or sunny. Plz fix
In some games if you come back to the game daily you get a reward, you guys at Niantic should add that so rural players can get poke balls.
Your new updates are still bad bad. The app freezes up a lot. For example I was in a Ho-ho raid in the middle of the raid the game froze and kicked me out and I was kicked out and I wasn’t unable to rejoin the raid I was robbed you owe me the ability to try complete the chance to   Get one. The updates does that a lot your trying for a oddish and it freezes or errors out no fun. 
The game was great at first but slowly but surely it just became a waste of time.  Never came out with any of the things they originally planned for and all the updates are pointless.  I deleted this a while back.
Guys why do you guys keep waisting time and energy making updates for this game, hardly anyone plays it anymore. Instead of trying to bring something back to life, focus on making something no one has seen, another craze.
“OMG!!!! Game play is absolute garbage but let’s put real world weather in the game tho, maybe that will fix all the negative feed back we have been getting about game play.”
Dude the weather function boost is great but i can only get roselias and rhyhorns and nothing else. Also what the freak is up with gen 3 being rare. I can’t get freaking starter. Even the boosted types. Too freaking rare
Hi I personally love the game and I play it all the time! But with gen 3 here I am getting worried. I have not been able to even get a legendary pokemon or any other teir 3-5 raid bosses low enough to catch. In fact the only raid I ever won was a teir 2 and it was because of my team we’re all at an advantage over type. Can you please make boss raids easier and a suggestion can you add quests? Maybe there will be one to get something rare and have more tasks and the reward would be like a pokemon, legendary, stardust, or even exp or candy! I really would like to see these changes! -truepokelord444 
That’s great that you e added more Pokémon, but I’m still waiting for features promised before the game came out. Where is trading and one on one live player vs player battles?
I think playing the game is fun and cool ❤️🦊
Avatar is no longer moving.
Daily Pokeball, this game isn’t bad. It is just with an iPod u can’t walk around which is annoying cuz I can’t get pokeballs which is annoying because I’ve made 4? Or 5? Accounts to play and every time I ran out. I won’t spend money because it’s not worth it because u can’t actually challenge a friend or someone to a fight, and they are expensive as heck. Also u guys never respond so why am I bothering to write a review? Who knows
I was really wanting this girafarigbi saw but my person wasn’t moving AT ALL!!! Please Fix
I can not purchase Pokémon coins it pops up a message saying error try again (3) please add a update to fix this
Pokémon go is a great game without a doubt but I live in a suburban area where poke stops and gyms aren’t very abundant and neither are Pokémon. My problem is  is that there needs to be more of a thing for suburbans I mean I do go out for vacations and it’s a blast but please do something for people who can’t get poke balls all of the time by walking a couple of meters.        Another thing is that I’m on a road trip and I wanna play Pokémon go and it keeps saying that I’m driving and can’t collect poke-stops  and when I see a ponyta at mackinac island in Michigan and I don’t have any pokeballs makes me cringe. I’m not saying it’s a bad game, I love it but please do more for the suburbs and rural areas. 
Went into my game, gave me an extreme weather warning in game. Mean while, irl it’s 9°C/48.2°F, with no rain/snow, nor even any wind
Just... where do I start um the game it’s fun but...... if kids want to play they need wifi and they don’t have data plans sooooo I mean c’mon this game will help kids go out and get exercise but then they see the WiFi symbol gone and think “ aw man no WiFi=no Pokémon  go that’s my only prob and the new weather bc I live in Canada the land of cold witch means wind witch means no Pokèmon that’s it tho promise it’s fun if u want it get it I love it lots love you Pokémon
It’s a fun game but niantic should really change the capturing system to more like the console games. I’ve heard it brought up a lot so I know people agree that the attack then capture method is much easier on the pokeballs and could be a good way to earn experience/increase cp.
Please spawn more generation 3 please I’m only getting the common ones
You’ve finally made this game a absolute joy to play. Thank you
I think we should be able to dress up our Pokémon buddies in little outfits for the holidays! Also we should get more casual options for our characters. Some of the outfits have severe glitches and it tends to bug me. Anyways, I would TOTALLY love to see my little espeon as a reindeer/ Stantler 💕
The latest updates are nice, but the game has become very glitchy and has started freezing up a lot more. Hope it gets fixed soon so I can appreciate all of the changes!
This seems like it would be a good game, however, when I try to walk, the avatar does not walk, and therefore goes nowhere near other pokemon? How is this supposed to work? Please fix this.
The Pokémon Go Plus has been lagging for the past few months (iOS 11). Obviously I figured a few bugs would come with the update, however Niantic should prioritize the Go Plus since hard core players paid to get it.
The weather forecast addition went from surprising to very disappointing. It’s a nice 86 degrees outside with slight clouds and pogo is telling me there’s extreme weather so check my local weather? Sure...I don’t know what idiot designed this weather addition but they definitely dropped the ball. To be fair, some people think that’s it’s due to the LA fires but when you live more than 50 miles from said fire, then that’s also bs. I rarely review apps but now a fix is definitely needed!
I love this game, it makes me go outside and extersize. I don’t understand All this hate!
Scam My mom tryed to lg me in they did it but it took me to a website I’m deleting this game 
Good update. Weather is a fun addition, looking forward to what castform can do
I PLAY POKÉMON GO EVERY DAY I PLAY POKÉMON GO
I can't even make an account. It keeps taking me to the same area were I say continue or something.
This game is the worst I bought some Pokémon balls it took my money but it didn’t give me the Pokémon balls. This game is a ripoff
This game is great, but I have only 2 problems with it. 1: The whether system isn’t working good in my area. I know there’s fire in Southern California, but no where close to me. So please just give me actual whether and not “extreme whether” when the whether is perfect. 2: I made the mistake of making my account on my school google account and with me graduating in June I really need a way to save my account from the school deleting it. I really don’t want to loose over a year of progress. Even if I have to change it to PTC cause that has problems also.
I’ve had nothing but problems with this game since day one. I have screen recording after screen recording of this game glitching and having error codes. I’ve missed out on so many raids because his game is garbage. It’s not my cell service, and it’s not my phone. I’ve gotten a new phone since I’ve gotten the game. And same problems. It seems to be my account. I’m not going to just make a new account and start over. I’ve invested too much time. I’m done. Fix your crap Niantic.
~Pokéstops = GREAT TOO!  LUV LUV LUV!  I KNOW U PUT A LOT OF WORK INTO THE GAME!  I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE IT!  U SHOULD AT LEAST BE 5-6 Years to play!  OR U CAN BE OLDER!  THANK U FOR THE TIME U USED TO MAKE SUCH A TERRIFIC GAME! Except for....I’M NOT ABLE TO PLAY WHEN 2 MANY PEOPLE PLAY 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😓😓😓😓😓😓😓 😫😩☹️😣🙁 And pokèmon battles are not at home 😭  AND WHY,OH,WHY DO I HAVE TO BUY POKÈ BALLS?!  WHY CANT I JUST NOT HAVE TO BUY THEM ( with the game money witch is very annoying,still ) AND TO JUST HAVE A BUNCH THAT DONT RUN OUT PLEASE   😘😘😘😘😘😍😍😍😍😍😍😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 
Ever since the update my weather has said extreme. When the weather was added there was a high wind warning but that ended the night of. Now two days later, with no wind warnings and mostly cloudy skies it still says extreme... what Pokémon have I been missing out on
l’ts the app l spend the most time on by far. Update adds new features and bug fixes worthy of 5 stars.
I’ve been getting the “Unable to Authenticate” error message ever since buying a new phone. I can log in under my old phone using WiFi, but otherwise the game is unplayable for some unknown reason. Whatever reason it is, it hasn’t been fixed in over a year (that’s how long I’ve had this phone).
I was able to login once with the new update.  Now it’s been 2 days and all I receive is the “Unable to authenticate. Please try again.” message.  I’ve tried on cell and WiF, shut off the phone, deleted and reloaded. Everything I could do to fix it, but alas no luck. 
It’s telling me to buy it but it’s free.Now when I try to download it brings up something I have to pay for.It doesn’t even tell how much money it is.
Great idea but attaching it to local weather has screwed some players who live in areas that barely see any type of weather change at all
First off I got to say I’m a huge fan of this game I even got my grandma to play it and she loves it but I have a major problem because I know it’s a lot of coding and stuff(I did coding so I know) but instead of  releasing a couple legendaries at a time release all legendaries at the same time then people won’t have to catch the same boring legendary Pokemon all the time. Also I would love to be able to catch mewtwo without an ex raid pass I would love if u just made mewtwo a raid boss without ex raid otherwise the game is great I mean I run into bugs every once in a while but I fix them keep up the good work 
Please add the greatest country:China,to let Chinese are able to play this game,I appreciate!
Months after the release of iOS 11 and almost a year after it was in beta, the Pokémon Go Plus is still barely functional. Why are they selling a mostly broken product and why can’t they fix their bugs?
Been sitting here trying to put my password in and everytime we follow the instructions but it never works DON NOT GET THIS GAME IT IS TERRIBLE
Since the update I haven’t gotten 1 potion or revive from a PokeStop or Gym. Without which I’ll never be able to heal my Pokémon and keep fighting. The Pokémon I have are all pretty low in health and if I can’t heal them I don’t see the purpose of keeping the game.
THIS GAME IS AMAZING ITS THE GAME WHERE IF I LOSE MY 3DS I CAN JUST PLAY THIS CAUSE ITS POKÉMON!!! But for some reason it takes up a lot of battery quickly so... BUT I STILL LOVE THE GAME IT GETS BETTER UPDATE
❤️
Since the weather system started on Friday, I've seen much more diversity, with many more uncommon Pokémon around.
I absolutely love this game, the new weather system is great, and it's exciting to see gen 3 is out. I hope this game will stick around, and keep adding all the gens until they get up to date with their other games. Some things I really hope are in the near future are trading, pvp, and shiny forms of all Pokémon. Great job with this game! I will continue to play for as long as it is kept running. 
This game is very good I really like the weather thing, but I want to be able to trade with people. I would like to trade Pokémon, poke balls, and stuff like that. Please do that in the next up date plz.
Adding the weather feature is super cool!  Im excited to see how it goes, i have already seen the snow screen and its very pretty.    I have noticed some pokestops have turned into gyms, as well as gyms and pokestops inside cemeteries seem to be lessening!   Very cool that developers listened and are starting to move pokestops and gyms out of the cemeteries, thank you!! 
The overworld seems to be the most touched-up aspect of the game. It definitely took much effort to implement these weather effects in the map.    ...but effort not optimally spent. The update feels rushed, almost: adding only a portion (granted a large portion, around half) of Hoenn Pokémon, and the gameplay still feels wrong, mostly because Hoenn is added and gym battles are still unique but a bit off. That was ok until Hoenn, and only the Pokémon and weather are represented. Not the abilities or any other series-defining tweaks (yet?). Now weather is suddenly a gimmicky mini-event, and the game now doesn’t feel right to but trying to fix what you’ve got is probably easier than dumping it and either finding a new formula or getting closer to the mainstream Pokémon gameplay...that’s possible right? 
Recently Generation 3 was released so after many months of seldom opening the app I went outside with the express intention of playing Pokemon Go in order to catch the new mons.  The problem is that Niantic didn’t think about how cramming 3 generations of pokemon into one game would effect gameplay. In a couple hours of playing I only managed to catch 6 gen 3 mons total...the mons from gen 1 & 2 are much more numerous to the point that most of the time they are the only mons that appear on the tracker...most of the time it feels like I’m playing in the gen 2 era.  I was excited to play this game again, but if I’m going to have to sift through mountains of old mons to get at the new ones I’d rather just not play at all. Gen 3 was a complete bust for me...I was ready to get back into this game and have a good time,  but, as usual, Niantic’s lazy mismanagement of this game has sucked the fun right out of it.  I think if you are a new player you will still find this game fun...there are more mons than ever to catch and everything is “new” to a new player. But to a level 35 veteran l’m just not interested in catching my 1,300th Pidgey while I wait and hope for a gen 3 mon to maybe show up. 
There’s a really really bad problem where when you go to use an incense you tap it it shows up on the screen and you tap it agin that’s normal but when I tap it IT DOSENT WORK!!!! I TAP IT LIKE 1000000 TIMES AND IT DOESENT WORK!!!!! I GET S MAD SOMETIMES!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!!!!!!
Love it. Omg best game ever
I love this game but can’t get enough berries at pokestop half of the time I don’t even get one.
This game is extremely enjoyable, and if you’re reading this as someone looking to get it do, I mean there is a reason why so many people like this game, but I have a few suggestions for improvements.   My family recently moved to a farm, and there are no pokestops nearby, making playing the game on a daily basis very challenging. I mean, before we lived in the suburbs with like one or two close pokestops so it was sort of easier, but even then I found myself constantly low on pokeballs. I think it would be better if you could somehow earn pokeballs, like have it give you one every day you play the game. This will do little to change things for people in cities, but could make a world of difference to fans in more rural areas, making it more playable and helping to spread the game to those rural areas.   Again, the game is wonderful, I just can’t afford to buy a ton of pokeballs and wish I could actually play the game on a daily basis with where I live. 
I'm stuck in "Extreme Weather" when it's 67•F, humidity is 10%, and the wind is only 6 mph. All because of a wind advisory that turned out to be wrong. This is ridiculous!!
Pokémon doesn't work it's a waste of your time you can get your email on Google it's bad for your brain so, if I were you I would never Ever in my whole entire life would never download Pokémon gos
I’ve been playing nonstop since this game came out and I find it ludicrous that I have been raiding a lot and going to places known for ex passes, to find out people who are a lower level get it especially people with sprint (which is a sponsor) as a carrier. Don’t waste your money to get coins. All you need to do is put a pokemon in the gym and have if it last a certain amount a time and you can get 50 coins a day. And you at least get 1 raid pass a day as well as when you level up.
When it first came out you could track pokemon in the wild using the feet. Make that happen again and you’ll have a player back.
I know that more Pokémon appear based on the cellular activity but I live in a place that doesn’t attract ANY Pokémon but i really love this game. I also don’t have cellular data because my family can’t afford it. I would REALLY appreciate it if you would make an update that makes more Pokémon appear in places with less cellular activity than it does now. PLEASE MAKE THIS AN UPDATE. A LOT more people would play if this was made an update and I know because this is the case with most people at my school.
My charmelion, ivysaur, and warturtle where transferred by the app and my gengar was made buddy by the app. Does anybody feel me? Also, my pokeballs randomly went from 39 to 5 because of the app. My trainer name is Colbycharizardx in case niantic is reading this. If this is not fixed for me I want niantic to go out of business.
I know that In Pokémon Go you can raid battle with your friends but I would really like is if you can battle players from other factions separately for say if your playing the game and you happen to pass upon another player of a different gym team why can’t those two players battle each other or why can’t two players on the same gym team friendly battle Me and my sister play and we love the game and it’s history though this and another thing I am requesting is why my rating is three stars.  My second thing is why can’t players trade Pokémon with one another or give and receive items and pokecoins this would ensure trust and friendship amongst the players of the same factions, and allows players to form rivalries against one another in battles putting up items and coins for bets.   In all this I say these things would make the game more fun. I hope the people who make the game see this and agree with me in my statements. I enjoy the product, and hope to see this next update. 
This game is gotten so much better in the past months!! if you stopped playing you need to try it again!
Real time weather affecting what spawns is a fantastic idea! So far, it has been accurate with the local weather conditions.  Am also happy with the gen 3 rollout!   Please continue your efforts against hackers and spoofers, and prioritize those efforts above trading and pvp. I’m especially opposed to having trading in this game as it completely defeats the original purpose of this game, which is to get outside and find Pokémon.   Keep up the good work! 
I truly love this game. But just saying guys if they released everything all at once it would be no time at all until most people capture every Pokemon. Max them out and then Where does the fun go?  They know what they are doing. This is the most successful game since Mario. They obviously know something other game developers and game designers don’t. I’m very satisfied with the way they are doing things. Although I would like to get an x-raid pass. I don’t know exactly how that works. But would love a chance for mewtwo.
I can’t play this game. I could and I used to but I literally can’t play... Whenever I try to log in I never can because it says “Unable to Authenticate, please try again” Please someone send me a fix
--- BUG/ISSUE LIST --- Constant error messages  GPS tracking worse than ever  Raids are a mess Gyms run slow and crash  Freezes when you catch a mon so you lose balls and you lose the mon Speed limit still ruins walking gameplay  Tracker is still useless Try again later bug Vanishing Pokémon bug Passenger message while stationary bug Sort by HP has never worked  Still no trading  Still no pvp  Super slow load time on startup  Constant login issues 
The game is a great game but my game is gps drifting to random places. And that is what I think
You hyped up the weather update but it doesn’t work half of the time and even if it does it’s not even that big of a change it’s mostly aesthetic.
This game is actually the greatest game ever! Even though it’ll talk a longer time for each Gen will be in Pokémon Go. I hope that Game Freak/Niantic will never remove the game from the App Store!
Pokémon go is awesome
Maybe try putting regional exclusives in eggs again and change the spawn diversity a little in players’ rural areas? seeing 90% of a day have sandshrew and ekans gets really boring.
I’ve tried 5 times and the app won’t load at all.  Please fix.
They should have an option to roam free without actually walking around, I only can play when I have WiFi which is usually at someone’s house or my house, and I don’t have anymore poke balls but I still want to play but I can’t do anything....
Don’t get me wrong from the review title, Pokémon Go! is an alright game. It’s features are acceptable, but for a game that wants you to pay for a few things (completely optional things) I feel there needs to be more drive than “I have a 1500CP Pikachu... now what?”  It feels like having a strong Pokémon doesn’t really have any serious benefits besides having bragging rights to your friends, significant other, etc. But where’s the thrill in battling? My wife and I both play and have some decently powerful ones, but other than the occasional “Wanna fight a gym, because why not?” there’s nothing to do with them.  Speaking of gyms, we are both heavily disappointed with the “50 coins a day, max” thing. See, before we knew that we went to about 4 gyms and took over them all, placed our defenders and called it a night. After some confusion we decided to look up how the gyms worked and saw the “50 coins” rule. Now, I understand Niantic wants money, everyone does, it’s capitalism. But to make something that “rewards” players for playing the game by not giving them enough coins to buy anything in the market is a little absurd. Our Pokémon sat in the gyms for a couple of days, there were no attacks on our gyms until all the Pokémon were so weak anyone could beat them. Probably because there is little to no real benefit to capturing a gym now. We find ourselves passing a gym and just saying “Nah” because we have a Pokémon in a gym already. Having a set limit takes the whole point out of trying to be the dominator of a gym. I mean, if I can only get my maximum allotment of coins a day by keeping a Pokémon in a gym for 8 hours, why use berries to try and stay there? Why do my best to retake a gym I’ve lost? Perhaps changing it to 50 a day for badge level one and upping the amount per with increases in gym badge levels? And why can’t every gym bring in more coins? It’s wildly disappointing to have a gym, defend it and then find out you don’t really get much, just 50 coins maximum, even if the Pokémon defends the gym for a week.  On to friend-related topics, namely battling and trading. Anyone who has ever played a Pokémon game, card or electronic, knows that the core of the game is battling your Pokémon against other trainers and trading them with friends. Not being able to do either one of those core things takes the Pokémon out of Pokémon. This kinda goes back to my other point “I have this, now what”. I’m honestly shocked that the game has been around for so long and anything like battling other trainers or trading hasn’t been implemented. Sure, we get the “we’re planning on doing that!” but after a year, this starts to sound a lot like the old “Your check is in the mail” bit.  I remember when the game launched and everyone I knew was playing the game, planning outings with friends to go catch Pokémon at high-count areas, and so on. It was huge, then, about 4 months later everyone said they dropped it because there wasn’t anything to do besides level up and catch yet another Pidgey. They got rid of the game they waited for patiently because there was no point to it.  Not adding those crucial centerpieces of Pokémon is why the game is slowly going away. Want more money, as every wonderful American company rightfully does? Give the people what they want. Take a page from the salesman’s handbook, page one, “the customer is always right.”  UPDATE:  I like the addition of the new generation Pokémon, I also like how it seems like there’s a lot more Pokémon available for catching. What I am not a fan of is how you increased the difficulty of catching a Pokémon. The bonus of %25 more stardust, and the higher powered Pokémon is a little useless when you have to go through an enormous chunk of your pokéballs just to try and catch something that before the update could be easily caught. My wife and I have both blown through our stashes of pokeballs and berries trying to get a Pokémon with a CP or around 400, just because it’s clear weather and that makes a Bellsprout some sort of divine conqueror of all. As odd as this is to say based on my last review, go back, sort this out and bring back some of the features. Less is more. We don’t need a little bit more stardust, but having more Pokémon show up because the weather is what they fancy is a really nifty and awesome idea, but you’ve clouded it with the increasing of the difficulty of what should be a casual game. That takes the joy out of seeing a Pokémon my wife and I have been a fan of for decades. “Hey, a Vulpix!” “Don’t bother, you’ll just waste half your pokeballs and it’ll run away...”  Seriously, you obviously show initiative when it comes to this game, put the effort into making it right and I am sure you’ll have better success with it. 
Hi I’m one of the players this is my favorite game ever I’ve dreamed of Pokémon in real life now thanks to you my dream came true all I ask from you is keep the Pokémon coming and the new updates like trading Pokémon and battling other players
Raids are stupid and ruined the game.
Best game ever
I’ve been playing on my ipad for about 4 months without any trouble.  Now with this new update I can’t join raid battles.  Sure it takes my raid pass, but then the screen goes blank or black and doesn’t let me join in the raid.  Bye bye raid pass.  So now that I managed to get to level 32 I have to give up the game? Or depend upon the benevolence of somebody else to let me use their phone for a raid?  That means I have to hope that there are enough people at a gym so there will be 2 raids.  Why did the new update have to make it harder for ipad users? 
PLEASE for the love of Apple, get rid of the stupid home bar in the app for iPhone X. It’s right by the power attack charge bar and it’s confusing.   Been playing since the game came out and it keeps getting better, well done! 
Dont waste your money in this trash takes 6 tries to capture anything $$$$
This game is awesome cut it keeps logging of my account and it's hard to remember your password but in the other hand it is great exercise😁 and it fun to get the ever evolutions!
BAD DESIGN----THIS GAME IS SO BORING WHEN NO POKESTOPS OR GYMS ARE IN YOUR AREA WHICH IS MOST AREAS.  IT PUTS YOU AT THREAT WITH SOME OF THE REAL WORLD PLACES POKESTOPS AND GYMS ARE PLACED SO BE REAL CAREFUL SO YOU AREN'T KNIFED OR SHOT.   In addition, this game has specifically designed it's locations of Pokestops and gyms to push crowds of people to specific shops to spend money and specific religious buildings to consider your beliefs.  In addition, IT TRACKS YOUR EVERY MOVE WHICH CAN BE GIVEN OR SOLD TO OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE GOV. & MILITARY. This "GAME" is a design of much higher social politics being used on the people and the people are being moved like SHEEP by their own choice in specific countries and not all countries.  MOSTLY THE U.S.
In regards to the new update, I have not had a good chance to go out and hunt for the new Pokémon for very long BUT with the new weather feature playing a role in the catching of Pokémon it IS going to leave a large number of states and areas at a disadvantage due to even slight inclement weather. SO Niantic please address this new feature or at least gear it down so people in states or areas where the weather can be unpredictable (CO) can still catch Pokémon!
Because
It would awesome if you offered a real live tutorial of the game
So, I luv this game (or app) soooo much!! A few things though. Now, don’t go on and say I’m a mean person, because this is feedback. So, a little glitch when you get to a PokéStop if you’re going to fast, it says try again later I think this is a little weird and hope you will fix it soon. Another thing is that when I got an update, it said you need to update to continue, so I did. But when I finally got the App Store, it said nothing about updating it. So I think it is OK but I won’t be able to play. Otherwise this the really great game and I recommend you all play it.
** game - wonderful to play and do at all times thought - should make new hair style options 
The new water sestom is amazing
The new weather system makes it possible to defeat or catch a buffed Ho oh at a sunny day, the only kind of weather when we can get enough people to do raids!  What kind of idiot came up with this system and thought it was okay to buff legendary raid bosses? Fix this or you will loose more frustrated users!n 
I love playing PoGo, but the new update is a HUUUUUGE battery drain. In less than a minute of playtime with no background apps running, my battery went from 40% to 23%. I already carry a back up battery, but if this situation remains, I won’t be playing as frequently much longer.
I love this App! It’s a must have on any smartphone. The amazing new update has just enhanced the gaming experience even more! Now the everyday weather can change what you see! Great new graphics, love the new Pokémon, and an easier Gym battling system. All around a favorite. You won’t be disappointed in reliving your Pokemon glory days in this well developed community.
I love Pokémon but seriously every time we do usernames and things like that and then when where all done it reapets again
First, thanks Niantic for screwing my streak. Getting a new version available error. Unfortunately, there is no new update as it happened three days ago. Lags and disappearing Pokémon for minutes at a time greatly reduce the fun factor. Also, dislike the times for raid battles. A good majority of the people that pay real money to play have jobs. Not enough time outside the business day to raid. Giving three days for a fix to the update issue. After that, it’s deletion time.
This app when I first got it I thought there would be items laying down everyone once and then: Yes there are those refillable stops, but what happens when you get an egg? Those incubators have to be bought for the egg to hatch, the grind is so slow and pokemon are difficult to find around my area... it's like 3 pokemon for every MILE covered, the mechanics in this game are not as good as the handheld versions
I love the game but it seems on the iPad one can not give the Pokémon berries when trying to catch them. One has to tap several times before the berry is actually thrown at the Pokémon. Please fix!! Missing a lot of Pokémon because I can’t give them berries.
I love this game but recently it has been telling me I can’t play the game unless I update it and it tells me where to click to bring me to and update page and it bring me there and it says there’s no updates it really make me mad because it’s sending me notifications saying to play the game but I can’t it just makes me mad!
There is none in TX!!!😭
The only thing I don’t like is legendarys don’t spawn out of raids and all you can get anymore is 2k eggs and there is no trades and there  should be ways to get coins other than gyms
Since the update/ new Pokémon were released, my app is running SO slow! Also, Go Plus hasn’t worked properly with iOS update for months now... Would appreciate work to fix a known issue instead of releasing new features.
Why is it so difficult to get assistance with passwords? Niantic, do you have a customer service line?  If I knew all of the information that is being asked at “forgot password/forgot username” I would have no problems. Someone please help? I don’t want to loose my info.
I love this game it is the best I have ever seen
The onley way the game would be better than it is now I if mew and mewtew were available to everyone and trading. 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩😵
I've had this game since launch and though I've taken breaks from it I find it relatively fun. My issue is 1. There aren't individual quests/ways to get cool Pokémon unless you want to hatch tons of eggs. Also, raids for legendaries need a lot of people, which often makes it hard. This leads me to my next issue, the eggs. I am an avid runner, but most of that is in my treadmill. Also, even though I walk 5k+ easily throughout the day, I can't just keep my app open for all that. You should follow iPhone steps or Fitbit or both in order to actually count a players movement. 
as more and more updates with more pokemon comes out, i really want to play. but since moving to fort carson, there hasnt been any pokemon spawning. there are no pokemon, no pokestops or gyms, no raids, and after this recent update, my neighborhood doesnt even show up on the map. i can see the highway, but its like they decided to just make fort carson disappear from the map. the only time i get to play this game now is during road trips and that doesnt happen often. i never had this issue back in fort knox so i dont understand why this military base is no long on the map. there is 3 parks around my neighborhood so you would think it wouldnt be too hard to get a pokestop or a gym. at least something.
in the pokémon section, it's too easy to swipe past the pokémon screen between the party and eggs screens. it should take one swipe per screen. very frustrating and difficult to get to the pokémon screen especially when i'm on the go.  also, i like the weather specific changes, but the map artwork for cloudy/rainy/snowy weather is kind of depressing and makes me not want to go outside to play. maybe make it a little more inviting and less dark/scary 
This game is dead
This the stupidest game ever it signed me out when I was playing the game and it won't let me back in I've tried everything
I play this game with the kids on who gets more of the Pokemon.  It was very fun and enjoyed it until the beginning of this year when you updated.  It used to open the game almost immediately. Now with all the recent updates it causes your game to lag and won’t open the platform until 30-45 seconds. Sometimes over a minute.  Please check on this issue.  A NY minute actually feels like 15.  Most city folks only have time to play this game on their commute to the transit hubs and off. If they cannot open the game in 15 seconds, they will just close it, not play your game at all and open another game app that is faster.  I do like this game and sometimes have time to wait for it to open but if we are walking and it doesn't open then you lose your gamers one by one. Thank you and I hope you can resolve this issue. 
Y’all really really really need to change the pokecoin system. Me and many others hate the 50 coins a day in the gym. We need more, a lot more so we can get stuff like scents and lures etc. plz change
This is a great game with a really fun premise. On the other hand, there are SO MANY CHEATERS out there. A huge dischord community based solely on spoofing. Everyone in my area has Mr. Mime and others that are not from this area. There is one player who made it to level 40 in three months. BS! Whatever. I wish cheaters were more strictly dealt with, but I still really like the game.
Game initially started off good with decent spawn rates and variety and decent (IV) Pokémon but later updates made 95% of Pokémon caught are now garbage. Game is now tailored into making you make micro transactions to play. Game is setup for little kids to too easily pay for items in game with overpriced items. Leveling up takes too much time and catching Pokémon worth keeping takes too much. Evolving also takes way too much play time. App developers focus is not to make a enjoyable game but a game that forces micro transactions for those who play long term or for kids that learn that buying money with items is the only way to play.    I would not recommend this app to anyone young or old, rich or poor to play. This app has the Pokémon brand and is free to install, but it is far from free to play. Save money and buy a different app or buy other Pokémon games on different consoles and you'll save money and get a better designed and quality game. 
I love this App/game! Love that this has caused my family and I to enjoy outside again.
My phone will not update game for past 4 updates and I don’t like game much anymore
There’s always SOMETHING wrong with this app. Right now it’s that it freezes upon opening and sometimes my avatar doesn’t know I’m walking and he stays in one place for several minutes. Even if they fix that, there are bound to be other bugs. This company just gets ahead of itself far too often. While it’s a fun game, there’s always something buggy about it and it just gets frustrating. Instead of constantly doing new things, figure out the things you haven’t fixed yet. Please.
I love the game. It gets me out and moving, but there has been things that I don’t really like. Some of Gen 3 came out, but some of Gen 2 pokemon are still missing. Mythical pokemon are still not here. People keep on mentioning more Mythical pokemon in Gen 3, but the other ones are still not here. We have all been waiting for PvP and other little things that have been  bothering me, But still more of Gen 3 is out now , so until these things are hopefully fixed, I will wait, and catch more Gen 3 pokemon.
I loved this game, everyone used to play it but here are somethings that just drive people away: 1. Slow development really brought the game down.  2. Gen. 2 came out to late.  3. Try again later on pokestops, when we aren't even driving! 4. This game had so much potential and Niantic just threw it all away for the money. 
As it is now, Niantic has moved leaps and bounds ahead of where they had been with the new Hoenn update. However, extreme weather warnings in the game, which severely limit play, are showing up even with light snow - this means that players cannot take advantage of the snowy conditions. What I propose is that Niantic allow us players to use our judgment as to what qualifies as extreme weather. After all - it’s not their fault if some idiot wants to run out in a hurricane to catch a mudkip.
I keep trying to update Pokémon go for gen 3 on my iOS device and the Pokémon go app have the little blue circle next to it to show that it is updated but when I go on the app, it says that there is an update that I have to do in order to even play and when I go on the App Store and go to update, there are ten apps that I need to update and one of those apps is Pokémon go. None of the apps will update. My whole family is experiencing wifi issues probably because everyone is on their devices and trying to catch gen 3 Pokémon in Pokémon go. If niantic can change this some how, that would be great. It isn\'t all niantics fault though, it is everyone\'s fault because they are on Pokémon go to much that some other people can\'t even send an email.
Are we ever getting trading? And PvP? I thought trading was confirmed.   I’m sad you dropped google maps because I liked seeing the buildings in the game. Seeing dirt paths now is...unnecessary 
Getting really irritated with the fact that everytime I update this app I have to login again and then I have to fight with making a new password why can’t I just update and jump right in like any of my other game apps
Great game but I wish there was an option to add gyms and pokestops.. in the entirety of my city, it’s town and villages there are probably less than 10 Also I wish that the game worked when you have no WiFi, the map works if you have google maps but you can’t tap on anything, and as a student I wouldn’t have a card with WiFi on it.. Because of this I haven’t had any poke balls since last year when I finished them DX 
I had a poliwrath  and in the Pokédex it said seen one caught one but after the gen 3 update it deleted it and said in the Pokédex seen one caught none same happened to my friend with an articuno
I love Nintendo and Pokémon so this is good
Downloaded the new update had to re log in on google and I can’t log back into my profile. I’m not starting back at level one! I was just getting good. So I guess I’m done with it unless one of my kids can get me back in
It won’t let Me in I did everything the game is crap who ever me that crap fix it who made it this is crap crap crap😡😡😡
Yum
I live in Colorado Springs, a city and I never seem to get access to any events including legendary raids? What is the point of playing if I can’t enjoy any events it’s ridiculous
Yes! The Hoenn Pokémon are arriving, and not just the Ghost-types! Also, the dynamic weather system is incredible. It’s going to make all Pokémon more powerful. I cannot wait to catch a Mudkip!
I love this game so much! I first heard about this game near when it came out, but I hated it because people where getting hurt doing it, making it seem like it distracts you from watching out for stuff in real life. Turns out it's not like this, there is a sound the game plays when a Pokemon is nearby, or if ur phone is on silent it vibrates. Anyway back to my point I love this fame but have some ideas. First of all I know that in a update that was released on the day im writing this, that the weather affects certain types of pokemon, making them battle better (they also added gen 3 pokemon that came from the hoenn region) but I think the turf should too, like near a lake will strengthen water type. Also if they added little chests around the map you can collect and open, with different teirs, like common will have pokeballs, pokecoins  and potions, or rare will have eggs, pokeballs, pokecoins, great ball, or an egg, and legendary, will have all the stuff I said plus ultra ball, master ball, or a super rare chance for a Pokemon hidden inside. Also if u have two fully evolved Pokemon of different genders (like a male and female Charizard) you can breed them and get an egg, but the egg will always hatch into the Pokemon it came from (like two Charizard make a charmader egg) and the eggs have unique patterns to show what egg it is, like a squirtle egg looks like it has a shell. Last but not least, it would be cool to find evolution stones in chests, that you can use to evolve Pokemon without spending candy, also there would be little items that strengthen the pokemons moves, and mega stones and keystones, so you can mega evolve Pokemon like venusaur. That's all, thx for reading.
I used to like this game but now l don't like it anymore because all you need to do is evolve ,catch,and fight with other players.thats why l don't play this game anymore .
Game is really fun but if you can't get enough coins be prepared to pay a pretty penny.
Love the game but the newest update has me stuck basically say push here to update and push here and it takes me back n circles. 😡
I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!!!!
In one day before the update everything was there and then when it updated the poke all disappeared it was 23 poke balls and 11 great balls.
Hi my name is Kaisen and I’m sorry about the name but I CANNOT PLAY
It's fun, don't get me wrong. But I live in the country, and by that, I mean my neighbors are cows. I rarely come across Pokémon in my area, and have no gyms or anything near (nearest is 10 mikes away I think). That’s not the biggest problem, if I have time, I’d go. But I have a full time job, and other responsibilities that keep me from running off Willy nilly whenever I feel like it. So my suggestions, make the Pokémon population spread further out. Create a way for players to link up across distances, to trade, battle, etc. maybe make gyms accessible from certain distances I.e: nearest gym 10 miles away, let me search it, and either link up to via internet, or synch to it when in person, so that I can then access whenever, wherever. If that could be done, it would definitely make us Pokémon fans who live in the middle of nowhere, to play and enjoy the game.
I haven’t seen so many network errors since the start of pokemon go app.  It’s insane.  If it loads to fight a new pokemon it will STILL error out and lose not only the pokemon BUT any items/balls you used!!!   HORRIBLE!  Fix it ASAP!  Limited time on certain pokemon we can’t get as it’s all errors!!!
After the new update I can’t login to my google account. I was level 30 with a bunch of my favorite Pokémon
I live in a town that has less than 1,000 people, even creating a Facebook group for our town and pushing it as hard as I can I sill can’t get enough people that are able to do legendary raids. I’m lucky to even get 4 people to show up and it’s really upsetting to be so close to getting a legendary but be shorted because it’s made for player or towns with a ton of people. Please help rural players out I’m going to miss the current one cause players are dropping off in my town.
Recently, this game has been taking forever to load. It seems more glitchy than usual. I have actually been kicked out of a few raids in the middle of the battle and when one Pokémon dies in a raid, the next one will not show up but it will still be killed. It needs some work.
When I throw the poke ball and wait for the 3 count the Pokémon runs away straight away the Weather for me is cloudy in the night and I can’t see the houses I tried closing and opening the app 3 times and still have the issue :(
I love the game. I enjoy getting out and socializing with the other trainers when there are raids. I’m just slightly annoyed that my Pokémon go plus seems to lag since I updated my phone to the new os. Please fix the connectivity issue with the go plus.
This game was fun for the two weeks I was able to use it. Lagged frequently. Poor designing all around. With each update seams to add more and more bugs to the game
I think Pokémon go would be more fun & exciting if other players were visible & you could view their stats & battle with them, but overall Pokémon go is a great game.
It could be better if we got to have Pokémon level up WITHOUT the Pokémon candy and if we got to do pvp.Maybe you could add some more teams too. I gave it a 4 because Blaziken is 1 of my all time favorite Pokémon.Please think of adding some of the things above!
Soooo I’m not getting a signal and I deleted it signed out did everything I could and it still says no signal 1.1
Nobody wants regional Pokémon, why do they keep doing it?
You can’t even sign up it makes put the longest username and you have to redo your password like a million times. I recommend you don’t get the game ,if you did delete now.
Says I have to update before I can use but it says it’s already updated. Won’t let me play and I’m currently on an area with a lot of poke stops and gyms and I’m missing out. Currently level 34 and looks like I’m going to have to delete the app. So frustrating.
I love this game, but it needs trading! Add trades to get the last star!🧐
We should probably put in the trading factor and the battling trainers around you like the original Pokémon game and I’m sure more people would play don’t get me wrong I like it right now but I’m sure others would agree it could be better and put in little quests and random people in the actual game like AI’s it’s a lot for the servers to do but as I said it would be booming after those minor features in the near future
I love this app, and game. Completely kick. But I think that Niantic really needs to work on how the game EATS the battery like horrible. How the app itself does nothing but glitch and lock you out, there's always so many bugs to try and work through. Just complicated, I've played since the mid summer of 2017 and I HATE the games glitching.... LOVE the game tho. Like always, #GoTeamValor
I recently updated for bug fixes and a faster loading screen was one of the updates too. I really didn't think it could possibly get worse after updating but it takes even longer than before to load up the game.
I enjoy the game personally, but I think it’s time to have some Pokémon go event that allows certain Pokémon that are so rare and never spawn, be able to appear, like porygon and mareep. And I’m not talking about rare as in good for future battles like dratini or larvitar, just common Pokémon that never spawn for some reason.
This game is absolutely terrible I would recommend to people with titles only.
IT WONT LET ME SIGN IN MY ACCOUNT UNLESS IM ON WIFI!! AND I HAVE DATA! UGHHHHHH WHY?? I WENT ON POKÉMON PAGE AND IT SAID TO DO ALL THESE THINGS AND IT DOESNT WORK! UGH
I can’t enter gen 3 raid after gen 3 update
It’s been over a year since the game came out and I’m still obsessed! Literally a dream come true to be catching Pokémon. Shoutout to Niantic for their continued efforts. 👏
Since I am a kid I love Pokémon go most girls don’t play it but I do I think it’s really fun and let’s kids move more i like that you can catch a lot of different Pokémon like Mimikyu pikachu malamar luvdisc and so much more!
I hate this game because I can’t even get in to the game it won’t let me. Can someone please tell me what to do?
My game keeps crashing ever since I updated the app itself.
It doesn’t let me update it yeah and it is starting to gat boring and now all my cousins hate is ok so make it better
So let me get this straight. Now I can’t heal more than one Pokémon at a time meaning it takes over 30 min to heal all my Pokémon. Now they added weather! I don’t care about the weather in this app. What the hell. Worst marketing decisions ever. Add trading already. I am not kidding if the next update doesn’t fix this I’m permanently deleting all Niantic apps off my phone.  This company has no idea what Pokémon players want nor do they care.
I keep on trying to sign in but it’s not working!!!!!!
Constantly with these network errors what is the problem I have service where I’m at yet I can’t fight any gyms or catch stuff because of the network errors this needs to be fixed if you expect people to play this game!!!!!!!!!! And why am I losing my raid passes do to these network errors this I a waste of my time to play your game if you won’t fix these error issues
It needs to ban people because there are hackers hacking my account
I tried to update my app it keeps giving me a banner saying error 4 update. It never updates can’t use the app at all
Update is the best of all! I’m very happy to see whether in the game, thank you!!
Ever since the new update I cannot update my own Pokémon go in my App Store and my friends Can
When the game first came out it was great, but now it seems like every few days I’m having to do a update just to open the game. If you want to get players back go back to the original game, and change the gyms back
我喜欢这个游戏
Best thing they could do is allow people who are not at the gym, but have a Pokémon defending the gym, to remotely join a raid. This would incentivize people to take control of gyms, keep their Pokémon active, and would also allow rural players, players with jobs, and players who can’t raid at specific timeframes to still be involved. This would also help get players into a raid instead of the hit or miss of only one person showing up.
This game was my favorite, I accidentally signed out of it. And now no matter what I can’t log back in. I was level 27. 🤷🏻‍♀️ it’s ridiculous a game like this should have a much better system to signing back in.
So I tried coming back to the game, and I don’t get the option to log in with Google Account anymore, only the Pokémon trainers club. I don’t know what happened while I was gone to change all that but it looks like I won’t be playing this anymore. Till that issue gets fixed
Game is rapidly changing now for the better. It’s almost like they know Harry Potter is coming! Which is great!!
Where are the new Pokémon that were promised this week? Just the same stuff as usual around here so no need to play.
Niantic has gotten so much better with the community. Now they need to work on the small glitches. I’m mostly a rural pogo player. By my house I have 4 pokestops and 2 gyms and I’m only a kid so I can’t drive anywhere without my parents. Spite being a rural player I have a mewtwo, i’m level 30 FREE TO PLAY, I also completed my gen 1 and gen 2 Pokédex except for magby.
The GPS needs to be fixed again I never had a problem with it before now I was where I was irl but now I stay still for a long time then teleport so I dont even get egg distance
I’m one of the many that’s been playing since you’ve guys started.. literally my most favorite thing on my phone lol. I keep up with every update and this is the best by far.. KEEP IT COMING! #num1fan
Update: PLEASE GIVE US MORE STORAGE for POKÉMON and ITEMS!!! It takes a lot of the fun out of the game to delete items and Pokémon every 5 seconds! We are all maxed out in both types of storage which is so frustrating! We have had this problem for months, and we were really hoping that when Legendaries or Gen 3 came out, that we would be able to increase both types of storage! I guess on the plus side is that it has saved me lots of money on special boxes etc, because there’s just no room for the items! I bought a ton of special boxes, and had to stop because of the storage issue. Also - it’s a waste to keep regular poke balls because I used to use the goplus all of the time, but we now just do our stop to keep our streaks - but now it’s pointless if our eggs are full. We are deleting items to make room for more items to delete, and the same with Pokémon. It’s so time consuming to catch Pokémon, only to transfer them immediately due to lack of storage. When I once got all pokestops (probably 50-75 a day,) and caught at least 75 Pokémon a day on 3-4 accounts constantly while my kids were at school, and after school, and on 4-5 accounts as a family on the weekends, it’s now basically 1 stop a day unless we need eggs so that we don’t lose our streaks. Between the lack of storage issues, and the shortened raid times - we barely even raid anymore either - and they were so much fun to coordinate with people and make friends. Now we can’t even get enough people in time to coordinate a Ho-Oh raid, which is just sad. Please help!!! Thanks in advance!   We have been playing as a family since the day it started! My son has been obsessed with Pokémon for years and was so excited for Pokémon Go to come out! We figured if you can't beat them, join them! It's been a very fun family activity - but now it's become increasingly frustrating. Please increase the total Pokémon storage and the total amount of items you can have in your bag! Every day I have to clean out the kids' accounts for both things. I hate deleting items and Pokémon that will at some point be able to evolve... when you add so many new Pokémon and different berries, you have to be able to hold  more items! Also - we all have Pokebracelets, and at this point, if you're going over a certain speed, they don't work either. I think it's more dangerous trying to slow down enough, or do it manually, than just pushing a button. Please fix ASAP!!! 
I love Pokémon Go but you should for Christmas give people a master ball so they can get their favorite legendary Pokémon for Christmas!(like legendary gen3 Pokémon)
After 1.5 years how and the hell can your game still have the same bugs? Seriously get your app together...
Moikage
Ever time I try to load up the game it says update to play I go to the App Store and there's no update needed .i don't know how to fix this bug.please help
Most of the time I play this game it is in the passenger seat of a car. However, Pokestops and Pokemon in general are hard to get with the “to slow” feature. I’m not saying remove this entirely, but who nows what might be on a highway.
I liked this game before but now that i moved to a small town, there are no pokestops and the only Pokémon that pop up are rattatas and boring old Pokémon. It’s not fun to play anymore.
PUTITOUT
Used to, there was a lot of people in the city. And playing Pokémon GO. Now, you see a few people playing alone and a group of 5, 6,7,8 people playing Pokémon go. Why? Now, you can’t catch good Pokémon without playing with a large group. sometimes with strangers😔... Niantic, you let us down...🤬👎
I play his game everyday and enjoy it. But when you can’t find new Pokémon in your travels...... it makes you not wanna play as much. The new Pokémon areas should be able to rotate, so that you can catch new members for your Pokémon groups. NEED MORE NEW POKÉMON and not just the same ones allllllll he time
well, i like the game but just recently my game started acting funny... my avatar would move to the opposite side of my location and then wouldnt move when i would start walking
I love Pokémon go it is amazing except we’re I live has very few Pokémon so it is hard to level up.
I think this game is so fun n and I think that running around town catching amazing Pokémon is a great time waster , also all the graphics and how all things are can catchable
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🤑
I love playing, but just a small thing from a probably small standpoint, it would be nice if the female avatars could have short hairstyles too, like a bob, undercut, pixie. I have have short hair myself and I think that it would be awesome if like the different clothing options that the female and male avatars have, could also have the different types of hair styles but also some different hair color for the people who like to dye their hair.
Every time I try to load in my game it says gps signal not found and I’ve restarted my game more that 5 times
Good Game, but it keeps taking me out of the app when all my Pokémon die in a raid, and I wish there were stronger Pokémon in raids. (More legendaries!!!)
Drop the gen3 update 18hours ago we had an update for bug fixes that’s all we had for updates are bug fixes DROP THE GEN3 UPDATE NOW WE NEED MORE POKÉMON the game is getting boring from just bug fixes drop it now
Pokémon go is now becoming stupid. I had a ex pass and my game crashed so I never got to use my pass. I was happy for moltress and the legendary birds but when mew two should come out Pokémon go gives other bull crap they work on updates that are pointless rather then work on what will make everyone happy that still plays the game. Pokémon go should really read some comments and go from there because they are stupid
Add more time on raids plus make them a like easier to catch on normal and legendary Pokémon for the raids. And more gyms and pokestops in small towns then make the a pvp like we you can just tap on a player vs player icon on the mean you battle based of of your Pokémon cp to make the battling even
Love the game but the special box(limited time only) are really stupid and pointless give us something actually good to spend 800 gold coins on instead of what you guys have now..-thanks
Fix it it keeps saying no signal and it’s never done that before
New gym special moves is bugged. I click it when it's up and the special move never gets used!!!!!
i used to be obsessed with this game! i walk or ride my bike to work everyday and i found that its doesn’t track accurately enough for egg hatching. i can go 2 miles and it says i haven’t moved. also it’s getting a bit stale i don’t do battles so i getting any new pokémon is pretty much impossible so sad i used to love it
I love this game but after continuously going to poke stops and fighting gyms I can never recover my Pokémon’s hp. We need more potions or need Pokémon centers.
are so stupid it’s so hard to get just make it easier for everyone to get one
I just updated and went to play today but I am unable to log in. I use my Google account to log in and when I tried to it said it “Failed to log in”.
For everyone blaming Niantic for there being a slim player base in your area; I ask you, what are they supposed to do? Make every raid soloable? No no. Please for everyone finding it difficult to find time to collect a group for raids, I highly suggest downloading an app called Discord. It’s the easiest way to find other gamers in your area willing to group up. It’s basically made for games like Pokémon Go. You have to download the app, and check Reddit or other sites found on google for an invite code to get into a server or chat room for your area. For example if you lived in Little Rock, Arkansas, you would type in “Discord servers in Little Rock Arkansas” on Google. Always check Reddit first, they seem to be heavy in Discord. But there are also plenty of people posting on forums and Q/A sites looking for people to play Pokémon Go with. And its also very easy to start your own Discord group of no one else has already. But really, blaming a dev for not catering to your specific towns needs is silly. My town is small but we still have a group of about 7 people who are checking Discord regularly and participating as well as several lurkers who pop in once in a while when we need that one more person for a Ho-Oh raid, or what have you. Trust me, it works. The alternative is complaining and expecting the game to be dumbed down into a single player, everyone is rewarded for nothing, type deal. No thanks. It’s a great feeling to have 5 others you don’t know all trying catch that same tricky Legendary and comparing IVs together. It’s unifying and fulfilling and I would be very upset if Niantic changed their mechanics based off a few bad tastes.
After the new update my house and subdivision suddenly disappeared? Like they arnt there anymore but the rest of the roads are
Ok niantic said training would be out las December... ITS BEEN A YEAR. Seriously niantic trading is what everybody wants not text fixed! Other than that it is a great game
I got 2 eggs and a couple of other items including Poké balls and items disappeared please fix and return my items
I’m level 32 and have had the game almost since launch. On iOS this game is still unfortunately, somewhat glitchy. A lot of it seems server related, such as the raid timers not displaying the correct amount of time. Making you sit for an entire two minutes before a raid starts and still not synchronizing the timer correctly seems inexcusable. Could we at least have a button so everyone in the raid can indicate they are ready to start, and start without waiting around for two minutes? If I’m soloing a tier one or two raid, that two minutes is a waste.   The gameplay is pretty much non-existent. Raid and gym battles are just button mashing. It’s not even worth trying to swipe to avoid charge attacks, because half the time that seems glitchy and doesn’t work. The meta-game is all about what mon to power up and evolve. And if you don’t want to waste your stardust and candy (you don’t), you need to use a third party website or some such to analyze your Pokémon’s stats. Could we just see the actual stats in-game, without having to go to the professor and a third party website for an analysis? This is extremely tedious.   I have the Plus and it’s almost necessary. I still never have enough stardust to sufficiently level up multiple teams of strong attackers. This isn’t an endorsement; I mean the Plus feels like a shameless cash grab, and doesn’t actually add anything to the gameplay.   There is a ton of community feedback I’ve seen on Reddit and elsewhere that seems to get ignored. I’m not saying every idea people have is awesome, but the feedback to turn this into an actual game is out there.   I still play regularly because I enjoy walking outside on my lunch break, and Go helps pass the time. As soon as a better AR/walking game comes along, I will check it out. It is fun to try and collect them all. There is a fun game hidden in here somewhere, but I fear since it’s been out so long already without basic improvements, Go might forever be lost potential. 
I hate that when my pokemon stay in a gym for more than one day I only get 50 coins. We should get 50 coins for each day my pokemon is in the gym. I work so hard for the gyms and i don't get the coins I deserve
Since starting this game I’ve lost more than 80 pounds from all the walking I now do. Entertaining way to lose weight.
I love playing this game new friends that we call each other family Pokémon. I personally have went from walking 200 steps to over 3000 a day and sometimes up to 11000 step. I have learned my city and found things I never knew that were close to me. Love the events. I have learned patience because still waiting on mew raid pass I just know there saving perfect IV for me 😁
1. More than 50 coins when at gyms. (My Pokemon was at a gym for 3 days and only received 50 coins, really?) 2. Being able to trade Pokémon like the old days when we traded Pokémon cards.  3. Not constantly having the SAME Pokémon in the area.  (I don’t live in cali and they get all of the varieties, not fair.)  4. Figuring out better ways to achieve raid battles.  (All of my friends refuse to play and it’s just me and my boyfriend trying to get a legendary #nothappeningever)  5. Increasing pokestops with the most active users. (I look like a creep constantly at churches and schools, let’s change it up before I get some parents accusing me.) 6. Raids. Ugh. NIGHT RAIDS. (Not all of us can be playing all day, let’s get the night shift on.) 7. Members playing at raids.  (It may be a threat I get it, but I wish there was a way to know how many people are playing at higher lever raids before I drive across town and it’s a dead zone, like I said before, not everyone lives in cali where people are playing constantly. I’m tired of wasting gas to go across town to lose constantly.)  **off my soap box** **just want to catch em all** 
Used to play all the time on my samsung s5. Worked flawlessly. Then i downloaded it on iphone 7 and it wont load. Just keeps giving me an error saying failed to load game data and i pressed retry 100 times with no success.
Yes, I agree with eveyone, this game now so crazy, always have something problems, i'm so mad. I these eggs 5km when they come out so terrible, never had some new pokemon, always come out so every every bad pokemon, make me so feeling nightmare when the eggs almost hatch😭, and 1 thing pokemon now so slow, always happend with poke stop, try later try later all the times, now I'm tired to walk or go poke stop. And the gen2 , I didn't see anything change???, even the pokedex , still 147 in pokedex😥   ..... today 12/06/17 I just give 2 ⭐️ for pokemon go because Niatic not equity, I live in small town FL, the where I live when the Raid Boss start just only me in battle, how I can catch the legendary????. I think 5 year, 10 year I still never and forever have the legendary ☹️😔😏😫😩🙁😒😔
Gen 3 hype
Something recently happened with power saving mode.  Not sure if it is IPhone 7 or Pokémon Go version, but it no longer works... now the game shuts off after a few seconds of inactivity no matter how the settings.  This is a big step backward.  In the past you could carry the phone upside down and the screen would go off, but the phone and game stayed active so you got credit for distance and vibration would alert you to activity. When you raised the phone the screen came back and you could play immediately.  Will this feature come back?
Spoof accounts have blocked us out of our gyms and writing to niantic provides no support
This new update constantly crashes after opening. I've removed and app and re-downloaded it as well. Same issue. Hope this is fixed quickly.  Update: latest version seems to be much more stable. 
I'm addicted to this game. I’m currently level 28 and have my Pokédex almost complete, except for the gen 3 Pokemon that are yet to be added, of course. I’m glad that Ho-Oh is a regular raid boss. Anyway, I’m super excited for gen 3 and the weather update. I think that the devs should start working on PvP and revamping the gym system (again). I’m super excited for the future of this game!
My husband and I have been playing Pokémon go for over a year now.  We very much enjoyed the old way of playing. The gym play was challenging and fun, having to level up to put your Pokémon in the gym.  The coins we received for being in there was fair; however now, with the new pop ins, it takes the value away from our Pokémon and their star dust power. Also most of the time we are not getting any coins for being in a gym for over 24 hours.  The treat process is worthless, becauseo (again) we are not getting coins for our efforts of keeping our Pokémon powered up.  It’s confusing to figure out how to earn coins.  We wonder what the point is to take over a gym now,  with taking the value away from hour Pokémon characters. (No leveling up)  We love Pokémon go...new Pokémon characters would be nice, but giving value back to our Pokémon would be better.   We hope to see improvements to this game. Great innovative idea...We are die hard Pokémon go players!   Thank you for making this game!!!! 
Awesome app! Pokémon!
I live 6 miles away from the nearest pokestop or gym I’ve never received a 7 day catch or spin bonus and my Pokédex is no where near complete. I enjoy hiking around the mountain I love on but admittedly it would be more fun with Pokémon go. Sadly there are almost zero spawns for miles. I enjoy the game and the features a lot but it’s just favoring those who play in cities. Gen 3 is coming out this Saturday and the added weather effect feature might help with spawns but I firmly believe that Pokémon should be categorized as either rural, urban, air suburban. Rural Pokémon are found in areas of low cell activity, urban Pokémon are found I areas of high cell activity and suburban are found in both.
My favriote game to play me and my kids both and i cant wait till the update soon gen 3 will be released!! #teammystic 
This game is amazing. This game is not dead. Gen 3, here we come!!!
Never had an issue until I had to redownload the app. Now it can’t find my gps at all. Help center useless and you can submit a report for this failed system.
Summer ‘16 was the greatest. Now, can’t even walk done the block to see Pokémon, let alone a random one in my house. Spawn on my quiet road don’t exist. Havent played in months
Please fix this it is so frustrating when trying to take down a gun and you get the error.
Ok sorry the FINAL EDIT : recently found out that the bug with coins was actually not a bug. My fault. I apologize this is an amazing game. Thing with potions is still not fixed but it’s ok!! Great game keep it up niantic. Also add the rest of gen three please!!!  EDIT: issue with the coins has been fixed, but I am still receiving no potions and revives from stops, same as my friends  Another edit: the issue isn’t fixed, and it seems to only give me coins half the time. My dragonite came back with 50 and my rhydon came back with none. My dragonite came back with 50 after being in a gym for 18 hours. When I opened the app, it said: dragonite returned with 50 coins. After playing for like 5-10 minutes, it said: rhydon returned from a hard battle! And gave me 0 coins. I put them both in at around the same time, my rhydon first, then my dragonite about 5 minutes later.  This game is amazing. I love playing it and it is fun and a great way to bond with friends and get exercise. It is always great to see someone else playing this great game. But the reason I gave it a one star review is because of 2 reasons. Currently in the game, I am receiving very little potions. I am level 29 and as you can imagine, I have lots of 2000+ Pokémon. So when ever I put one in a gym, and they return, I have to use my potions and revives. Like I said before, because I have been reciving no potions from pokestops. this is very hard because I currently have like 20 Pokémon who are dead that I cannot revive, because of the lack of potions. I have kept track of my pokestop rewards, and I only seen to revive potions every 10 pokestops, if not every 15. I continuously get 2 poke balls and one great ball at almost all of them. The issue with potions has been happening with my friends as well.   The second reason is that when I place a Pokémon in a gym, it never gives me any coins. I’ve had Pokémon in gyms for DAYS and not get any coins from it. I had my slowbro in a gym for about 2 days, only to open my phone and say: slowbro fought hard and returned! And give me no coins. A friend of mine had this issue as well. He had his gyrados in a gym for a WEEK! And come back with 0 coins. I don’t know if this is a weird glitch, or if niantic is trying to make me purchase potions and revives. But this problem is amplified because I am not getting potions from pokestops. My Pokémon just die over and over and bring no coins despite being in gyms for days. When I revive them, I cannot heal them because of my lack of potions. This game was perfect (besides all the bugs) before this issue. PLEASE FIX. When this is fixed, my rating will be 5 stars 
After updating Pokémon go goes to sleep All.The.Time! Useless. Can’t really play until it’s fixed. Probably will find new mindless entertainment before then.
This game is the reason I bought an iPhone, it's one of the best games I ever played but I do have a bunch of ideas: 1. I'd like you to add more Pokémon from the other 6 generations 2. I'd like you to add Pokémon Amie from Pokémon X, Y, Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire 3. I'd like you to add the ability to breed Pokémon of the same type 4. You fix all of the problems that are causing everybody to rate this either two stars or one star 5. New reason: Delete the “Oh no!” part of what happens when a Pokemon runs away and replace it with “Darn it!” You don't have to add these but it'd be absolutely awesome if you did. Thanks 
It’s been a year and a half since this game has come out. It still feels very much like it’s in beta.
When you live outside of town you only get the bare minimum if that  More random Pokémon spawns of ALL Pokémon should be implemented  Raids should be available to all at level 25 and raid passes should not be needed cause if you fail a raid you should be able to try again 
I had had some Pokemon that were really close to evolving, I caught some more, and I was gonna trade them for more candies. BUT NOW IT WON'T LET ME. I AM 1 AWAY, WITH 5 SHELLDERS IN MY INVITATORY.   FIX THIS 
Proper iPhone X support would be nice, please. The edges are chopped off and the screen stretched up - it has distorted the images and makes playing hard. Please give us iPhone X players a proper screen ratio please.
Ever since the update I have not been able to gym battle or raid. When trying to access either the game errs out. Lost 2 raid passes and over 60K xp. First raid erred out when opening the gym. 2nd erred out trying to rejoin battle(lost pass and had to use revives and potion on fainted mons)and would not let me back in or a chance to catch Ho Oh. 3rd erred after taking my raid pass. No response from support. Very frustrating as I’m only 15K xp from lvl 30 but if game is not fixed soon will be deleting it.
Can u please update the Pokémon bag to 1500 or 2000.am max out now
My game tells me to update my game when its already updated i open the game and it tells me to update it but when i go to app store it just says open and not update
In 2016 the game was good but now it died off
Amazing game really fun but improve the gp radius plz
We’re only on Gen 2 and it’s almost been year since gen 2 release!!! Give us gen 3!!!! Plus, Mewtwo should be world wide!!!! No randomly picking who gets to have a chance of catching it!!!
They continue to tweak this game with minor text fixes and bug fixes. They need more customer interactions and news updates on development. When will trading and pvp battles be coming out? Holiday events and new Pokémon aren’t adding to the game. We expect those. We want deeper content. Also add a feature for user submitted Pokestops for rural players. If Niantic doesn’t want hacked mappers and IV calculators then they can add those in themselves as DLC. I’d pay for an overview map that shows my entire city with raids and Pokémon stats and spawn times. There is a lot they can improve on to please their customers/players and enrich the game.
I have the Pokémon to fight the raid but not enough to kill it I always run out of time plz Niantic make them easier for rural people sake.😊
Love this game to death but they do not put out enough updates if they could up the update amount I would pick up my phone and play more often
I used to love this game, but the way defender bonuses are limited penalizes me for having good gym defenders.  If my Pokémon goes a few days before being defeated, I only get the bonus on the day she returns.  If I have several out, and they all return at once, it’s a lot of waste Ltd effort.  Weak Pokémon get kicked before earning.  Strong Pokémon limit earnings to once or twice a week.  Give me the 50 coin bonus at the end of the day whether my Pokémon comes home or not!  Killjoys!
First off let me start this off correctly. I am a Youtuber that focuses mainly on mobile apps, and I’m looking for a new series but there are some slight things that we need to talk about first. Keep in mind this I have over 60k subs on YouTube and my fan base seems to be very loyal to the apps/games that I play. But Pokémon go is such a slow game to play unless you use a hack. Okay so the app is dying more and I for one hate it. Sadly it is a well known thing, but the ones that are actually Pokémon fantastic are still here though, and honestly if you want the app to go big again think of this... Most of your users use the TutuApp or some variant of it, but the TutuApp doesn’t work super well.  Honestly what you guys should do is make your own controller in the game that is actually configured for the game. Come on starting up from your house still and just traveling around the world that would be amazing and then you could teleport back to your actual location. THANKS GUYS if this happens I will update this with my tag and you guys can come by and watch your hard work put to work. 
Why do we have to update before we can play
I find it funny that in the recent update Pokémon go tried to add in sidewalks. The ended up destroying my city’s map and more than 3/4 of the buildings just aren’t there including my own.
Great game a lot of fun, bringing people together for the same goal with raids etc, it is designed to get a few dollars out of you. I think it would be nice if we could battle each other!! And also see how battles each Pokémon has won, a poke center would be cool too.
I always imagined catching Pokémon in the real world, never knew augmented reality could become the new thing with catching Pokémon in the real world. Despite the issues that still need to be resolved. It’s my daily cardio everyday when I’m out and about. All in all, I love it !
His game is to be fun when they were new pokemon to catch. If you don’t battle it’s boring. After this last update it’s even worse. The only reason why I keep this game is because my daughter plays. When you Pokémon come out we go out.
Battling today I got kicked out trying to catch a Ho-Oh could not get back in. Lost potions for fighting and didn’t get the chance to catch him. I want my raid pass back. Second time in a week!
If I were to guess I assume that while switching from Google maps to Openstreet is causing some problems with location accuracy. The biggest issues are when waking from one place to another my character tends to remain in place. The other issue is when I'm standing next to a pokestop and the game thinks I'm standing down the street (this issue is magnified by the first issue).
The experience in the iPhone X went from meh to worse when they "added support for the new resolution". They didn't adapt the game, every screen is just zoomed in, some text doesn't display correctly anymore. It really doesn't make for a great experience on what really is a high profile fun game.   Other than that It's a fun game and gets me outside a lot more. 
As well as the loading screen now taking longer, your phone automatically locks itself while in the game, even with auto lock set to never.
GPS signal not found (11)
I cant login to my account because I don’t have a trainer account? Ive been using my google account just fine prior to getting the iPhone X. I thought the game play would be better on a newer phone. I was sadly mistaken. I can only play on my iPad, maybe ill have to look for it. Yes I know first world problems but I’ve spent money on this and if its not going to work i want a refund. AND IM NOT WAKING AROUND THE PLACE WITH A IPad Pro LIKE A CRAZY PERSON.
Since the update, the map does not function properly
New map is missing a lot of info. Roads just disappear. Makes it hard to play.
After the most recent Pokémon Go update, the screen dims whether on low power mode or not, when it never did before. I understand you guys stopped using google maps and maybe this has a reason as to why? Regardless, PLEASE FIX! This is very annoying.   Using on iPhone 8 iOS 11.2. 
Ever since the newest update when I am in the game it times out after like a minute. My phone is set to not time out and it does anyways. I have never had this issue until the latest update. I love to play but that makes me very frustrated and not want to play.
反反复复反反复复更丰富
Amazing game
First of all, I would like to say that this app is super awesome. But warning: IT IS HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!!! I am looking forward to the new updates. The one thing that I think would be a good idea is that when you have a Pokémon assigned to a gym while you are at home and are unable to see it on the map; is to make it so you can view the gym to see if it is in danger of losing (or gaining) prestige points! This is a very great app and it brings memories from my childhood!  UPDATE:  I was going to download but read the reviews. Seems like the developer does not care about the customers. Not downloading. 
This game used to be fun but now it’s just old ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
If you use the Go-Tcha band to enjoy playing this game with friends and family, you won’t be pleased with this update.   Niantic doesn’t seem to grasp the idea that just because they didn’t think of making a device that users could purchase; which would spin PokéStops and attempt to catch Pokémon automatically, if desired; without the need to press a button; Thus complying with the law by being Distracted Driving compliant, because with the Go-Tcha band you just set it and forget it. Unlike the Pokémon Go Plus!  Let’s face it we all know we run the app while in a car wether you’re a passenger or of course, the driver. Even though we tap “Okay” when the warning pops up not to play while driving. You know you do it too, don’t deny it.   Perhaps you’re on your way to and from work. Earning more monies to spend on  PokéCoins so you can get more lucky eggs, or lures to help you on your way to level 40. That progress and those purchases are going to come to a near complete halt after you are forced to update to this latest version of the app.   They broke their own Pokémon Go Plus device with a previous update testing a way to prevent the Go-Tcha band from working and now they’re pleased as punch that they’ve successfully turned a superior device (The Go-Tcha band) into a lowly Pokémon Go Plus piece of junk. I do hope the company that makes the far superior Go-Tcha band puts out an update to thwart Niantic’s latest effort to make this game horrible just like Pokémon Go Fest was.   BOOOOO NIANTIC!!! For doing everything you can to prevent people from having fun and buying a better device that often costs less than the terrible Pokémon Go Plus.  December update... All of the android users I game with have no problem with their Go-Tcha bands. They still work as described above. All iOS users no longer have the same operation with the Go-Tcha band; they need to press the screen to use it. Everyone in the group I play the game with believe Niantic; the people that don’t like cheaters and apps that “give an unfair advantage over others” don’t seem to have an issue with giving android users; the OS that gave permission for Niantic to know all other apps you are running on your device because they don’t care about user privacy the way that Apple does; (Thank you Apple for defending our privacy) that same “unfair advantage”.   Niantic is practicing its own HYPOCRISY and doesn’t even care. They need to enable the Go-Tcha band to work properly for iOS users again or take away the “unfair advantage” they’ve given android users to make it an even playing field.  SHAME ON YOU NIANTIC! SHAME ON YOU! 
When you run outta pokeballs, can’t catch Pokémon, can’t play the game. 😟
Game is essentially unplayable from the latest update. Game closes if you are not actively tapping the screen. Impossible to simply walk with the app open to hatch eggs. I will not be using until the next update rolls out.
Stopped playing because the have been “investigating” for months.  Really?!?
It won't keep me signed into my account and every time I go to sign in it won't allow me and says “unable to authenticate” it’s been happening EVERY SINGLE TIME I try to play the game, for over 4 1/2 months now. Pathetic.
I updated the game and now when I go into not only do the buildings not show up, neither do Pokémon, even though it shows in the thing that they are around! This is very frustrating. Couldn't play till I updated the app and now I can't play cause nothing is showing up!! FIX PLEASE!!
I really enjoy playing this game, but the User Int

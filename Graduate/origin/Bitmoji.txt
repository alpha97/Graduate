I really miss the bitmoji style of them instead of just one style
I wish we could pick out our own shirts, tank tops, tops, pants, shorts, skirts, shoes, heel, sandal etc.  iPhone 7 Plus 
Thank you for staying faithful unlike Snapchat!! 😁
MY BITMOJI IS ALMOST THERE I JUST NEED MY LIP MOLE MY FACE IS INCOMPLETE WITHOUT IT  Also I wouldn’t be mad at more clothing options but mostly just would like to put a mole on my face 
Love everything about this app. Maybe it could have more lip color options and face/head shape options. But overall I love everything. The clothes are super cute but I would love there to be more clothes. Like possibly being able to pick pants, shirts, and shoes separately? Picking the clothes is definitely my favorite part!
Love the updates, but please bring back the old hairstyles in addition to the new ones!
I’d like there to be an option to make your own outfits. Also add necklaces, earrings, ya know...more accessories. That’s all. Everything with the new update is superb. Also let us customize our mouths. Like vampire fangs or grills.
Love the new hair treatments but yo... nobody has blonde roots and dark ends. You gotta flip that. It’s a hair sunset. Fix this and it’ll be 5 stars.
Firstly I just want to say I love this app and it allows me to pretty accurately make a Bitmoji of myself but I do wish that you had more outfit choices or even be able to customize an outfit for your bitmoji. And in the older Bitmoji days at least you were able to give yourself earrings but I don’t think we can know, so with saying that I feel as there should be an option to give your Bitmoji facial piercings and ear piercings.
It is amazing but every time I press the update button it doesn't update it just loads for 3 hours then stops
I love Bitmoji, I just wish I could put two features to define my face instead of just one. I have defined cheekbones but I also have freckles, and I’d like to put both but I can’t.
I love the app all I really want is just more black hair styles and the option to dye the tips of the hair blonde like Odell Beckham
Okay so I REALLY luvvvvv bitmoji but there are some things about the app that I would really like to be included.  •Switching clothing: okay so I’m pretty weird about my outfits so on bitmoji I’m the same way. It would be better if you could mix and match different tops and bottoms •HEIGHT: my bff happens to be REALLY tall. On bitmoji everyone is the same height:( •BABIES: okay so maybe there should be a way to design your kid/baby Idk hope this stuff happens. I would really love if this happened and I’m sure that the app would get muchhhhh better ratings. Luv ya😘 
I will say customizing your looks has gotten WAY better (finally)! Designing your looks is awesome, especially with the new hair!  However, the clothing options are still mediocre. It’s either clothes that you’d find sixteen year olds wearing or mature business people. I wish their was more customization with this (being able to pick out shoes, dress, shirt, jewelry, etc). 
Can we get some Star Wars?
Would love to see some USA gear during the olympics!
How can I get the ombré look
i LOVE the bitmoji app. i honestly think its so cute and funny, and i use them way too much. but I think it would be even better if we got body jewelry, like nose rings, eyebrow piercings, lip rings, etc. a lot of people, including myself, have stuff like that and we wanna add it to our bitmoji!
Lost availability of the above items
I was really excited for the ombre and when I checked I had all clothes hats and everything except for the ombre! 😡
You should add wavy and curly hair
More clothing options would be freaking awesome please and thank you!!
They need more curly hair options.  Don’t leave curly hair people out.
The eyebrows for deluxe avatars are not working. They won’t change from the default, stuck at default. It needs fix
I love this app! Of course, there is the occasional cussing and alcohol references, but thankfully I’m mature enough to handle those. May I suggest though that you are able to pose yourself and make your own picture to be able to send? That would be super cool! And I know this would be a lot to have to work on, but maybe even Bitmoji gifs..? Just a suggestion. Tysm for all the hard work in this!!!
Being able to make custom outfits would be nice
I hope to develop an Arab style like turban and dress and Ghatra and the mind
My Bitmoji used to look a lot like me.  With the new update, i now look nothing like my bitmoji.  The new eyes are all too large in comparison to before.  Not happy with the update.
Hey where are the ‘get ur jush’ and ‘hey jush’ bitmojis Please respond 
I would love to have more outfit options and customizations along with more body size options. Almost all of the outfits for “female” avatars are way too feminine for me. I’m sure nonbinary people, tomboys, femme boys, or androgynous people like me would like access to more outfits for all gender expressions.
I love the Bitmojis - however, I wish that the clothes updated more often. Different styles are always fun and maybe being able to also pick the colors yourself would be a lot of fun. Also, it would be pretty cool if users could control how accessories fit on their Bitmoji (ie hats, many of the hairstyles aren’t covered fully on top by the hats and it looks silly)
Y’all have done made so many new updates that are great. Could you please design some decent avatar clothes for them to wear. Everything is so ugly.
I love Bitmoji but since the update I can’t even come close to a resemblance! Do you guys have issues with people with short hair and rounder faces? Jeez! Loved it before the update!
I love the app and the stickers but I can’t make my Bitmoji look like me because I have a beauty mark on my cheak and I can’t get that on my character. Please add this feature.
I love the app. But could you bring back or make new ones for “Justice League”? When I got my new IPhone I lost my Superman outfit. 😔
Great app, does a better job of personalizing the avatar, and the expressions/phrases are great —varied & funny— but not with as widely expressive as I’d love to see.  No offense, Millennials, but some of us would like to see more options for choices like breathe, meditate, or anything slightly stronger/positive, more confident than what’s currently available. Ollie had a good idea with the clothing choices, too. If the additions could be incorporated, I’d be a bigger addict to this fun app than I already am. (That’s right - fearless to become even more attached!). Thanks - great work! 
Everytime I click the app or try to open it , it says “ no network connectivity “ and no matter what I do, it still won’t work... needs to be fixed.
Overall every thing is amazing but one little thing. For bitmoji style, can you add a normal braid and a double one too! Hope you consider these recommendations! Thank you!
Please let me have the old version back the bitmoji deluxe is honestly terrible. I beg of you pleaseeeeee let me have the old style back.
I love the app it is so addictive and so fun, they have creative pictures of your own personal emoji! My whole family has it and they are absolutely love it. Very Creative app and very fun. 5 star Rating ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
I really enjoy this app. Everything about it is great but I would recommend on change. I think it’d make it better if had more outfit choices. Instead of only the outfits available there should be a section where you can dress yourself from head to toe. We get to pick out shirt, then out pants, then our shoes, etc.
God why
All I ask for is more hair options for short hair... like hair that parts in the middle. Is that too much to ask for? Also, for glasses not to be so high up on the bridge of the nose, where I can actually see my eyebrows.
I’m thirteen and don’t wanna be 40 thanks #fu #sorrynotsorry
Tbh I’d really like to be able to choose my outfits myself? Like scroll through the shirts pants shoes etc. piercing options would also be cool?? Nose, eyebrow, ears, lips. Ya know?
Love the new update! There a couple of things I would like to see changed: - Lipstick colors? More neutral pinks preferably. Darker skin tones do not work well with the ones provided. - Lip options? Not too many more, but 3 seems like way too few. - Outfit pieces? Being able to create your own outfit piece by piece would be awesome. I don’t dress much like the outfits provided, but I could make something work if I could pick and choose. 
Love this app! Took time to get use to but ended up loving it!!!! I love all the new hair options but their needs to be more clothing options!!! I feel like we get limited way to much on how we look!!
Love the new look but now can we get new outfits?
I don’t think many companies realize how nice it is to actually have representation and have an emoji look exactly like you. with the new features that were just installed, i have the character tht has the same hair as me and matches up with all my non-eurocentric features and i truly appreciate it, i’m so happy now :) other emoji apps need to take notes
Please bring back the pigtails🙏🏻 👧🏼  *It’s my (real life) signature blonde hairdo, and been my staple style on bitmoji avatar for quite a long time now. And suddenly there are pages upon pages of hairstyles on the app, I’m which I’m sure that having all these choices is awesome for most, yet....no longer the simple pigtail option😔. 
THIS THING IS TRASH!!!!!!!!!!I DID MY UPDATE AND I WANTED TO CHANGE MY EYE SHAPE BUT, IT ONLY GIVES ME EYE COLOR!!!! SO I’M STUCK WITH BIG GOOGLY EYES!!!!!! I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED😤😤😡👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
I’m tired of the outfits, change them out. In need of some more poppin outfits.
Can you add masks like anbu black ops and dual colored hair like xxxtentacions old hair
It’s great way to show yourself but I hope you can add more new clothes!
Is there a way to go back to the old Bitmoji style?? :((
I really like having this app. It's like having a mini me on my iPod and I can use any Bitmoji for the mood I'm in. It's also really fun just to see and design my very own activator!
I wish they included all the new options into the other styles (like the new hair treatment and styles) rather than only putting them in the new bitmoji style. I’d like to keep my bitmoji style but add the new hair color to it. The facial features in the new update are very based off of the original bitmoji style which, in my opinion, do not like, and just want to update my hair color.
It got a bit better but there's still no good curly hair options. Don't punish me for rocking a jewfro.
Bitmoji is great an all but could you please update the app more so the people who use it can make their own unique look, including making your own hair style, choosing an own if of your liking, etc....
this APP IS THE BEST
Bitmoji can use some piercing, like nose, ears, lips,eyebrow, and more. Just a thought.
If the developers paid any attention to social media, they would know that nobody has one color hair anymore. There is an extreme shortage of potential hair styles, and the lack of color options means that a lot of people are not able to make an avatar that even remotely looks like them.
I really love this app. I was on the App Store writing a negative review about Snapchat but I really needed to write something positive, and I really like this app and the concept, and the new update is fantastic. 10/10 would recommend
I like this a lot, but Mayans make it so you can select the clothing or do a mix and match type deal? Everyone dresses differently and I think that’s the only thing lacking in this app.
1)We should be able to choose our own shirts, pants and etc. individually that way we can mismatch our own outfits to express ourselves in a different way.  2)Now this one is for me and others who may have braces.I think you should add a mouth that has braces so that the Bitmoji looks a little more like ourselves. 
I never write reviews unless I’m getting paid to do so but I have a huggge suggestion. I’d love it if you guys would create a pet emoji for people who have pets.  The dogs on the app look nothing like my dog lol.  Create a petmoji! But add the petmoji in the bitmoji app so we can send them doing activities together.  For example walking, feeding, bathing, napping, or playing fetch with my dog.  It’d be great upgrade💜🐶 
hey bitmoji! i like the update and all, but by now, you need genderless clothing or let your users pick out each clothing item. just a BIG hint :))
IF YOU DONT LOOK ST ANYTHING ELSE LOOK AT THIS. Get a thing for people with braces. And get different braces colors pleeeaaasssee
You should let their Be Bitmoji with ur friends on iMessages too. Other then that the app is AWESOME!! The update is AMAZING! 
I hate the changes made to the app.  The new Bitmoji looks like crap. I wish I never upgraded.
I can only rate 4 stars since I’m super excited about the clothing options. I think people would enjoy it more if we could pick out our own clothes instead of the outfits that are already preset. That’s really the only issue I have.
I really love this app. It’s very creative and I think that personally, getting it was a great idea. It’s really cool because you have this avatar that you can personalize and then make it look exactly like you... almost. You did really well with all of the new features added in the recent update, but I have a few questions:  1) Why did you take some options away? I had a Bitmoji that I really liked and when I updated it, I was forced to change it. I thought that maybe it just reset and I would have to recreate my original, but I couldn’t do it because some of the things I used were taken out of the app.  2) Can you please add more skin tones? The one my avatar has now is many shades too light, but the next closest option is much too dark. Please fix this as I feel that it is exclusive to people who have other skin tones than the ones you offer. It forces you to pick one that doesn’t adequately represent your own. 
I absolutely love this app but I feel like u guys should add like almost an make your own clothes section and add the Winter Olympics clothes for the season because that would be really interesting and fun for both the ideas(please add soon)
i cant edit my jawline and cheek details on the style “bitmoji classic”
Honestly, I don’t like giving any app full access in the keyboard. That made me very weary.
Ok so first of all the bitmoji deluxe is great, I love the new hair, makeup options etc. I am also in love with the bisexual and trans emojis because it’s really important to represent those groups. My bisexual friend actually cried when she saw it because she’s never been represented in an app like this before. The only note I have is that you add a few more hair styles (particularly on the curly variety) because I can’t find anything that really matches. Also to update the clothing because I typically wear graphic tees and ripped jeans and there’s nothing really like that to choose from your app. Thanks!
I love this app but the reason why it’s 4 stars is because, It needs accessories like earnings, braces, and it also it needs more mixed hair colors like, rainbow, and other mixed colors
Love it but I need some more options for weight in the thicc department. Also please give me the option to have a double chin.
I just want my bit emoji to be wearing earrings like I wear earring I’m a guy and earrings is something a lot of people wear yet I can’t find it
Why can’t I use the camera feature? I take a picture and it just gives me the bland generic face instead of actually using my picture to generate a Bitmoji. Fix it
Please add a feature to add a mole to the face! Lol. Have it available to put anywhere on the face and customization of the size!
I can’t even get on here it’s always a problem when I try to use this app need fixing bad I’m having a bad problem with login in need to be fixed NO STAR ⭐️ FROM ME until I can login in this app for me need to be fix ASAP cause I cant sign in
They look good just need to add waves for a hairstyle and earrings for males pleaseee
I really like this app. But it's sad to see they don't have my hairstyle. I have a shoulder length Bob with straight bangs and would love to use that hairstyle for the bitmoji. Please make it happen!
Great app, but the only thing missing.. TATTOOS! A lot of people have them. But despite my emails I’ve sent to them, they do not add this feature. Annoying.
You can be Younger to get stickers  Why can't it be 8+ ? 
I really love the update but wish that I can keep some of the features I have that aren’t available with the update. I have long dreads which was available as a hair option in the old version of the app but now that the update has come my hairstyle is no longer available and there are only 2 styles that resemble me. Like I stated before love the update but wish some of the features I had on my old Bitmoji translated well to the new update. Keep up the good work I like where the app is headed!
I love using my bitmoji!! Especially the deluxe!! Wish Snapchat could catch up to it though. You can play with the deluxe like you can the classic. Also wish we could get some new outfits soon. It’s been awhile since they have update them. I use my bitmoji everyday!!!!!
I been trying contact you my bitmoji won't appear in rear camera on my snapchat did uninstall/install both of them and still doesn't work so please fix it!!!!!!
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE APP, it’s so good and funny and I use it all the time! So I have braces like lots of my friends and I would like you guys to add preferences if you have braces or not. So yeah thanks!!! Love the app!!!
I love this app so much!! I don’t last a day without changing my avatars outfit😂💗
I’m a curvy girl but not the round shape you offer. :(. I need more hip.... more boob!!!  I love using my little mini me to express myself and would like her to look more ME!  Please and thank you.

This app is great and the new update has added so many cool options! A huge suggestion/request I have is to possibly make an option where you can add piercings? I have a septum ring and I feel like my Bitmoji isn’t complete without it. I would also suggest being able to change the mouth width and have a few more options for lip color.
Everyone has the option of dyed tips, but i don’t. Why????

This app is so much fun and I looove the update! The only thing is you either have to be skinny or jump straight to apple shaped chubby. Can we get more body types, please? Hourglass chubby, pear chubby, etc. thanks!
This is a great app! Now some advice from a crazy chicken lady... First... Could you please add in a chicken suit for the outfits? I would love my bitmoji to be in a chicken costume :3. Second, could we have little bitmoji pets? That would be super adorable. The petmojis could be with our bitmoji and that would be super adorable! Thanks!
The update is A+, the only thing that would help would be to include facial piercings like nose rings or eyebrow piercings!

This App Had A Whole Bunch Of Hair Styles But None That Cater To The Rasta Religion. Where Are The Hair Styles With The Dreadlocks???

i have a lot of freckles and i wish there were and option to have more freckles rather than just the cheeks!! please make more freckle options 💗🤟🏻 thank you.
I loved the update, now my bitmoji looks more like me than ever before! It is so cute and the new stickers are adorable and funny. I have one dimple though, and there isn’t an option for one dimple. If you guys added more face features that’d be great!! I read another review at the top and it would be awesome to have a third option for genders You guys would get A LOT of support from the LGBT community.
Would you please add the antlers in the deluxe Bitmoji :(
It is ridiculous how many times I have to re download the app and restart my phone just to get the networking to work for my bitmoji. Sometimes when I try to log in after re-downloading the app it tells me I can’t even log in because the network is down.
What happened to how the bitmojies used to look? I liked being able to pick a more cartoon bitmoji against a more life like one. Snapchat and Bitmoji updating will probably just result in me deleting both of them.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Howdy!

Can we maybe add a wider range of skin tones????? It’s like we have decent selection of fair skinned and dark skin but the medium tones are just lost in these greyish ill looking colors 🤔🤔🤔🤔 none that actually depict a medium tone.
Unless I’m just not seeing it, I miss being able to pick your clothes separately. Like a shirt and then pants/skirts and then shoes. The premise outfits are okay, but I don’t really like any of them. This is like a super nitpick, but yeah. :C
Would like to see piercings and tattoos as an option. My nose ring is a large part of my identity. Also more variety in outfits
The new hairstyles aren’t any good the dreads look so un uniform and completely trash I’m sorry but you could’ve at least kept the old styles these just look messy  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Hi there, you can easily switch to an older avatar style by following these steps:   - In the Bitmoji app, tap on the round Gear icon in the top-left corner - Tap on ‘Change Avatar Style’ in the middle of the Settings screen - Swipe to select the style yo 
i love bitmoji, don’t get me wrong, but lately i’ve been noticing some issues.  -when i try to download the app, it PERSISTENTLY asks for my billing information though the app is free, and when i put the info in, it says that it’s invalid and there was a problem with my last purchase, BUT I DIDNT BUY ANYTHING.  -there should be more options such as, •a third gender option that has both male and female options.  •facial hair for women!  •instead of swiping through entire outfits, swipe each section individually.  •more makeup options + makeup for men.  •a flat chest options for women and breast options for men.   thank you for reading this and i hope you take my suggestions into consideration! 
Latest update appears to modify your Bitmoji, but it is not applied to the gallery
App is perfect! I wish the halo was a wearable accessory though, and not just for the selfie pic
Can you guys please please make long curly hair? There’s like 10 straight long hairstyles to choose from and like 2 short curly hairstyles. I have long curly hair and would love my bitmoji to look a lil more like me. Otherwise great options, great app
I love that we can choose short "boy" hair or long "girl" hair for either gender you choose. But why not do that for the outfits too? I am a girl that likes to dress guyish but the outfit options are very girly and they don't have a big variety of styles. I wish that we had access to the guys clothes too, not just girls. There's so much more styles out there for woman than just the stereotypical girl. If there's any way we could have a bigger variety of clothing styles it'd be much appreciated by everyone
No complaints its a great app but I have an iphone and my friend has an android and his isn’t much different but he has way more and in my opinion cooler customizations. His features way more hairstyles, facial hair, hats ect.. Just looking for extra customizations is all
The deluxe is great, although I’m disappointed there’s less lip choices now! I loved the narrow mouth with full heart shaped lips! Hoping this is temporary …
So I have an iPhone and my friend has an android and we went to create eachothers bitmoji, so we could get more accurate representation of ourselves and we noticed we each have features on ours that one of us doesn’t have? Like she has more cheek lines (one that I need actually) that I don’t have. And I have the hair treatment and she doesn’t. Just really confused why the app isn’t the same for everyone?? Kind of annoying.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Hey, it sounds like you and your friend are using different Avatar Styles.  You can easily switch to a different Avatar Style by going into Settings (gear icon in the Bitmoji app) and tapping Change Avatar Style. Note that each style features different ar 
:)
Is it possible to when you go on the maps, you can tap an action button and make your Bitmoji move around or something?
I just think there should be more body types. I have more of a bigger hourglass figure and I wish they had a type like that!
Here’s an idea, instead of putting a bunch of the same head wraps and hats, why don’t you just put the different variations and then an option to change the color instead of taking away the cool headgear like the headband with the feather on it (which was my favorite) :(
I love my bitmoji and I’m very obsessed with it but I have a concern, why doesn’t the bit strip avatar style have a variety of African American hairstyles like the bitmoji deluxe avatar does? If you could add those hairstyles to the bit strip style it would be way more convenient for a lot of us ❤️.
I love this app... me and my friends all use it. I think it is amazing! And I couldn’t find a better app than this. But I have some suggestions for the outfits on the app. Like maybe adding Harry Potter styled tees or robes. I’m a huge Harry Potter fan. And it will make my day if you added this to the app. Once again amazing app, love it. Bye
You should have more maternity outfits to choose from.
The new avatar features are amazing. The ethnicity of the hairstyles were done so well. Good job!👏
This app is ok but it says 12 and up and I don't know why it doesn't have anything inappropriate it's ridiculous but the app it's self is great 👍🏻
i think the app is cute because you kind of get to see a cartoon version of yourself, but it needs a lot more outfits with a larger selection. so bitmoji, get some more stylish outfits!!
If the app could offer jewelry and tattoos. More so jewelry than anything though for the ears for the ladies and just jewelry for piercings in general   A lot of the new makeup colors and lipstick colors do not look great on darker skin tones   More hair options/style for those with locs  Also the chin and lip options...there should be more options for lip shapes and sizes and also the chins jut out way too much making the emoji look unnatural 
New update is cool
I updated it but it never gave me the new ombré or new hair styles so this isa 1 star  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Hi there, you can find hair treatments like ombré in the new Bitmoji Deluxe avatar style.

I like the new update for the Bitmoji app, but you don’t really have anything I wear. Like I wear Nike stuff, but a lot of people at my school where fox racing stuff as do I for like dirt biking and thought it would be cool if you added some fox sweatshirts and jerseys on here
I love this app and how cute my character is but I wish that you could access both gender's clothing. The Sims 4 did it, why can't bitmoji? It's a small detail but it would mean a lot to people like me who wear clothes that don't exactly fit their gender.
I really like how you could make your self in Snapchat
ahhhhh i cursed at the app before bc i hated the way i looked but i figured out that u can change the style and i really hope i don’t get banned from bitmoji or anything i’m so sorry
Great app but you should be able to customize animals so if you have a pet you can have either their own Bitmoji or one with you (or one without the pet so it could be like it is now)!
I like the app cause it’s cute and stylish
So I downloaded Bitmoji and managed to keep my old Bitmoji character but when I saw the selection it was very disappointing. It gave my Bitmoji a face as long as a horse (you guys have taken away the Afro away as well, what’s up with that). And it’s making it difficult to somewhat depict me. Not everyone’s face is the same. I’m fine with everything being added. Just don’t be like Snapchat and take away the good stuff.   Suggestion: add facial types, like how Nintendo does with their Mii characters, they know there are many different facial type and features and they added those for diversity. So please just take that into consideration. 
LOVE THIS APP SO MUCH
The app is so good you should get it
This app is so much fun! But please add Major League Baseball and an option to change the colors of shirts and pants/skirts. Christmas and Halloween themes would be fun as well.
I agree i feel like if you let the peson have a pick of wat shoes go with wat and tops and crop tops to and of wich coler thay wood like and so i put 4 stars and intell you let the pepple diced it will stay that way but i do love the app that is just my ting i feel coud change
This app needs the option of adding piercings & gauges on the bitmoji . Where's the creativity y'all ?
I love the app, and hell I love the new update, but if we could design our own outfits that would be fantastic! I have this black hooded vest I love wearing with a long sleeved shirt and jeans and combats and there is a minority of us who don’t wear what’s on their bitmoji. Just a customizable outfit would be awesome!
More clothes, please!
God awful, sterile, self indulgent avatars. It looks like it was taken from a bad webcomic in 2003 and now you’re being forced to use it on Snapchat.
I had the PERFECT image in Bitmoji...then you upgraded and changed options...my family and friends are upset.  They want to know where I went.  How can I get my old Bitmoji face back?  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   开发者回复：Hey there, you can switch back to Bitmoji Classic or Bitstrips style by opening the Bitmoji app, tapping Settings (gear icon in the top-left), and choosing 'Change Avatar Style'. 
It always says connection not found
I think the hijab looks like a potato sack and they should pls fix it bc I don’t look like a potato sack irl. The old hijab was a lot better. Messy, but better. But thank you for giving us a variety of colors this time :)
I love this app but... the new update says it comes with all these features, correct? Well, I updated my Bitmoji App and all I get is a feature where you can take a picture of yourself so your bitmoji will look more like you. That’s the ONLY feature I got 😬 I don’t know if it’s a glitch or not.
Way too many cats, need to include dogs like yellow labs! Also college attire should also be included and I couldn’t find the Astros, or Texans in the sports attire! It would also be pretty cool if you included all types of US Military uniforms not just the battle uniforms (although those are pretty cool)! Thanx! 
It’s a very cool app to use while texting my friends but I really wish that I was able to use the highlights on the hair tho. Oh well it must be a little glitch.
I decided I wanted to make a new Snapchat account so it would match my username for Instagram. I wanted to have the same Bitmoji deluxe that my previous Snapchat account had, but when I tried to make a new one for my new Snapchat account, it would not customize my face like how it did for my old Snapchat account. I really like the new Bitmoji deluxe style and I don’t know how to fix this.
I love Bitmoji and use it on a daily basis and I love the addition of Bitmoji Deluxe for more options than Bitmoji Classic. My one complaint is that i’m Asian and there are no real asian features to chose from. I chose the closest features I could to resemble my own and my Bitmoji looks too white and doesn’t look like me at all. Hopefully the next update will incorporate more.
I think the new Bitmojis are amazing and look much more like real people, my only complaint is there aren’t enough short hair styles. As in shoulder length ones. If you guys could add a couple more variations of medium length hair that’d be great😊
I love bitmoji but I think that u should keep the old hairstyles, eyes, etc from bitmoji before the update still accessible.
I would give the app 5 stars if only you added the ability to have 2 different colored eyes... my avatar doesn’t even look like me
I think this is great but would like more clothing, shoes, accessories, medium length hair, longer hair, and make up options. Be able to choose what shoes, shirt, dress, pants, swimwear, snow gear, FOX RACING RIDING GEAR!!!
I just have a couple of suggestions.   1. can you add Under Armour to your clothes 2. Suggestion 1 😀THX 
Bye
I love this app so much it is so easy to use, and it is so accurate when it comes to customizing! But I wish that you had the option to put braces on ur teeth and be able to change the colors 😫 plz update and have the braces option
I love the bitmoji app! I like to use it to annoy my friends and I love how it’s compatible with Snapchat. However I would love for each gender to have the same clothes selection. I am a very masculine female, and it seems that I’d much rather wear the clothes that the boys have to chose from, rather than the female clothes (without changing my gender; I am a proud female). I’m not sure if the males have a feminine selection of clothing, but I would definitely appreciate a masculine selection. Besides the clothing, I love the new update with more of a diversity of hair.
Needs more curly hair options, there is wavy and then very voluminous curly hair but no just normally curly , cmon plz
Ok so I love Bitmoji and all but when my friends and I got the update it updated theirs to the different features but mine didn’t! So I rate it a three.
PLEASE give the option of having a smaller mouth size. I look nothing like myself because my mouth takes up half my face with the only 3 options given. Other than that, love the new update!!
I love this app that I can use my own personalized Avatar, however my only problem I find is that it is not very accurate. I can’t get it to look exactly like me. It would be cool you can take a picture of your face and it will translate the shapes into your character. Other than that a wonderful app.
I love the new update but there's just one problem. My lips are super full and your previous version accommodated that. Also the lip color variety isn't as big as it was 
We need more women’s clothing options! Or make it so that you can individually choose shirts/pants/jackets. There’s been no clothing updates for women in so long! Pleaseeee! More clothes! 🙏🏼
I updated my app and have the ends of my hair dyed yet I don’t get the ombré hair update :/ everyone else seemed to get it except for me.
Where did all the long hairstyles for men go? The non-deluxe versions are still there but once you go to deluxe the long hair options are styled more towards female styles. The buns are nice but they still look quite effeminate.
I love the newest update but there should definitely be more mouth types, different lip shapes, and there should be an option for gapped teeth.
Im sorry I just dont like this new update:(. I love the app but me and I'm sure many others have noticed their are not many options for the jaw, face shape, mouth, and lips. Whatever I do, my bitmoji does not look like me and in return I dont want to use it:(. There should be more jaw options because I think the jaw is very important. Also the mouth options are very short. The mouths are all long and my mouth is not long. The lips as well only have three options which isnt enough. Please on the next update offer more variety for these categories.
I want Japanese style cloths like yandere chan or kimonos
Don’t get me wrong, I love the silliness and awesome roasts that this app has :). However, I do have some suggestions to make this app even better:  1. The clothing!!! I can’t tell you how many times I want to be able to have a black hoodie with cute blue jeans. There should be a section where you can pick which shirt or hoodie etc. and jeans or shorts etc and shoes or boots etc.  2. Makeup. The palates are beautiful but we should have more colors to choose from because I like more nude colors but not so nude you can’t see my lips and that’s all there is that goes well with my facial expressions. We should also have contour but this is still just my opinion.  3. Nails. Girls and boys should be able to choose our nail shape and color. For example some girls *or boys* might want there nails long and white and when sending a face such as 🤔 we could use our bitmoji to make it funnier.   I love bitmoji and these simple requests would make it 50X better :D 
I’ve been with Bitmoji since you were just Bitstrip, and I love the app and the new additions. I feel that you all have done some great work responding to requests to make the app more diverse so that people of all colors, shapes, and sizes feel included; however, there is still room for improvement. These suggestions are in no particular order and I feel that they some are more important than others, with number one being the least pressing.  1. Earrings. Please. Earrings for the Bitmoji Deluxe. And just piercings in general.  2. There need to be more makeup options for the darker skin tones. Because the colors you all have now don’t work that well on people of a darker color   3. More clothes options. I like the old Bitstrip setup where you could choose a shirt and choose some pants and change their colors. You should bring that back in conjunction with what you already have.   4. By entering a unique username or email you should be able to find someone else’s Bitmoji and create scenes where they interact. Like you could add friends and select them to create s Bitmoji with them. This is a feature that you can access right now exclusively on Snapchat, but I think that everyone should be able to do that.  5. More body type options. That way people can have something in between skinny and huge. Also, being pregnant should be a body type option so that you can be pregnant and still have all of the clothing options as everyone else.  6. A third option for gender that is “non-binary” and has both male and female options for creating to Bitmoji because not everyone is just male or female. Also, makeup should be available for both men and women, and there should be a feature to let you toggle between the male outfits and female outfits regardless of the gender you’ve selected. 
i don’t hate the new design but i got the old design to look just like me, is there a way to get it back? :(
So I love this app and especially the new update but I have one suggestion. Could you make it so that there were more outfits and also you could swipe through the options (pants, shirts, shoes,ect.)
I would like to see the option for more than one bitmoji. Like a library for all of your bitmojis but maybe still just like have one selected to show up for messages. Like make bitmojis for fun or for friends. That would be so much better!
Okay 1st of all I love the app! It makes Snapchat so much more fun to use but... for some reason I can’t get the new update!!! Everyone has it and their Bitmojis look so adorable but mine is complete garbage.
I luv this app I just think they need more features. More hair options. Eye colors, maybe different colored eyes. Different chest sizes. Just more options of everything!
you should creat an option for piercings.
I love bitmoji but I wish you could make children for your bitmoji then it would be perfect! I was so happy when I was pregnant to learn I could make my bitmoji pregnant too but now they just need a children option!
I love Bitmoji but the new ombré hair WILL NOT WORK ON MY PHONE now I just got an iPhone 7plus and it’s still not working and my friend who has an iPhone 6 it works on so if you could fix this that would be great
Tbh needs more clothes options I wish I could change colors or make my own outfit
I was really excited for the new hats. When I opened my Bitmoji app after the update (Snapchat too) I DIDN’T GET NEW HATS. It didn’t update all the way. I am very disappointed. I will rate 5 stars when you fix this.  Edit: I unlinked it from my Snapchat and deleted then re installed and I had Bitmoji Deluxe. I’m glad it worked but it’s annoying I didn’t get them with the update so please fix this so I get everything with the update not a partial update. Thank you.   Also, may you PLEASE add something where instead of going through the outfits trying to find a good one, make it so you can pick a shirt and pants / skirt  and shoes separately and pick a color for them. And please add a bigger variety when you do this, so like different skirt styles or jean styles then a color wheel to customize yourself. I do like the shoe variety I just wish you could pick style / color yourself for an outfit. 
this app is good but i got one recommendation. you could make it so that if you’re a women or man you could have all of the choices like beards, all the clothing, etc.
Loving the fact that you included ethnicity for all on the update. Really love the natural hair styles. One thing...I miss the earrings. Please add a selection for that again.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
So my mom got this app and she has way more features then me kinda new hairstyle and highlights my Bitmoji is UPDATED but I can’t find the highlights and those new hairstyles? Please help!!
I used to love it so much!! But recently it has not been working. I'll try and edit my character and won't let me. I deleted the app and got it back and it doesn't even let me connect my account to it.
Bitmoji has sucky skin tone options. People who are asian and take a picture to make their Bitmoji often come out looking like a white person. It’s not very accustomed looks for other races besides black and white.
You guys should also add NASCAR outfits too please. I love NASCAR and I would be highly appreciated if you add nascar outfits. 😃😃
How come the boys character has more anime clothes than the female characters? I think this is no fair and should be taken care of .
I’ve had Bitmoji for over a year now and LOVE it, especially when it comes to using it in Snapchat. BUT the biggest problem I have with it is the lack of body-types that are available. Can we please get more body-types to customize our Bitmoji’s with please??
I love this app but there is one thing that would make it da bomb. Being able to color and mix the clothing items, to make our own style.
Before they didn’t have any natural curly hairstyles now they do! And yes to the plethora of skin shades!!!! 🙌🏾
Kinda creepy, NEED MORE MATERNITY OPTIONS!!!!!!!!
Bitmoji is a great app I absolutely cannot stop changing my avatar this app is great for children and adults the only thing is the should make a pet Bitmoji so your pets and animals can have one too.with this pet Bitmoji idea you should also be able to put the bitmoji of you and your pet together!
I think that on snap chat there should be more variety of outfits. They have all the sports outfits besides soccer. They should have like the main teams on there
Love the new update, I always struggled to get my avatar to look like me till now. It would be even cooler though if we could add facial jewelry. My septum ring is my defining feature 😉
I like the app, but I would suggest adding hazel eyes, different hair color ranges, different outfits, piercings, and tattoos.
Can you add a few more features such as facial piercings etc ? I feel like it’ll definitely make my bitmoji look more like me .
I love spending time on bitmoji and making my avatar look like me. But I’m all honesty, I’d love if you added face piercings as an accessory option. We should also be able to mix and match shirts with pants and shoes. Other than that, I love this app!
In Snapchat, we’re able to edit our selfie. Just now, I saw the selfies got updated and there were more than the usual selfies. They have the dog filter and more added selfies. I used the dog filter, saved it, and quit. Minutes later, I returned and they were gone. The selfie activated was the dog filter I chose, but it didn’t show in the snapcode. The rest of the new updated selfies were gone.
Can you please add soccer clothing like Barcelona,Real Madrid,Chelsea, Arsenal, etc. Can you also add Tommy Hilfiger and Polo Ralph Lauren I really want clothing like that. Everyone that wears polo or tommy or soccer clothing will go to Bitmoji and put on their character Polo, Tommy or soccer clothing. Everyone will love Bitmoji if y’all add those type of clothing’s. Can yu please add them please🙏🏽
Love it but I think we should be able to put braces on our bitmojis and also be able to change the colors to match our own 😂🤷🏼‍♀️
I love this! but i really wish there were more options such as piercings and also more gender neutral options. but seriously add piercings! it would make it so much better. also the menu for scrolling through outfits is awful
I love the new deluxe Bitmoji, but can we get some new outfits please???
You forgot to add earrings to the deluxe 😭😭😭😭
Finding out that the Batman costume is gone hurt my heart. 😭
❤️this app is amazing 😉 I can express my feelings
App not working , nor will It let me create a new bitmoji .. To make the situation even worse It made me delete my old one and unlinked my bitmoji from snap and It keeps saying network not found or internet not found . Fix this please !
Update garbage
🗣 BRING BACK THE SAFARI HAT PLEASE
You “added” more hats but you took away tons of hats. All you did was add colours of the same hat. ADD BACK THE USHANKA.
I wanna be able to give my Bitmoji braces because I have braces
I think y’all should make it where our Bitmoji can have braces or piercings.. it’ll give us more ways to express ourselves.
With the update came new bitmojis and boy do i wish i left mine the way it was. THREE CHOICES FOR LIPS?!! that’s all we have access to??? and theres like 30 types of hair but you deleted the one short semi- curly hair style that related to me?? none of my friends can get their bitmoji to look like them again. i’m severely disappointed.
This app is great. Th only thing I hate is that I can never find the clothes I’m wearing on there. So I came up with an  idea about one year ago and thought they should make a camera option were we can take a picture of our clothes and then get the same clothes. I also had an idea were we can also make our clothes. We can chose a shirt, the pattern, the color. Sam with the pants, and shoes. So Bitmoji can you please do that. I am begging you. Please, and thank you. 😇👍🙏
I really enjoy the new update for this app, the bitmojis definitely look more lifelike and there are a lot more options of things to choose from. However, when are we going to be able to customize our own outfits?! Everything else is amazing but I would love to build my own outfit so it truly looks like me!
i think u should add a sweatshirt and leggings outfit with adidas and some pajamas too
I love using this, but please give me clout goggles
I have curly/wavy long hair (i’m hispanic) and there aren’t a lot of options for my hair type which is kind of frustrating. There is one hair type that like a middle split that’s wavy but it’s a short hair style and there are none that are long and curly. Is there a way that this could be added? Because that would make me love this app so much more.
i really like bitmoji and i  L O V E  the new update, but i think it could be better if i could change the size of the mouth, because i could find the lips that look like mine, but the mouth is too big and it makes my bitmoji not look like me :( if you could add that to your next update i'd be so thankful :)
Well i was trying to use the new feature to take a photo of my face and it comes up with what the app thinks i look like but it doesn’t work. It works on my other friends but not me. I used other people’s phones to try the feature and it still doesn’t work on me. I love the app otherwise but im just frustrated over how this never works for my face.
It would be really awesome if our bitmojis could wear our favorite soccer teams outfit I recommend this so much
Love all the new options, especially for hair!
I’m liking the new avatar! Facial piercing options and jewelry would make it even better! Oh and maybe some new outfits or better yet the option to piece together our own outfits. Perhaps some of this can come through with a future update...
When I got the app I made my avatar and I wanted to put earings there was no earings and I thought like what!!!!But overall it's a good app.
The new update blows
I love bitmoji and I love updating how mine looks!! But I wish there were more outfit choices!! It would be better if you could individually pick a shirt, individually pick pants, and then shoes, instead of having to pick an entire outfit! But otherwise I love my bitmoji!
Took away curly hair and now my Bitmoji looks nothing like me. Why must you keep messing with things?
I love bitmoji they’re super quirky and fun. But there used to be more customization of the facial features, like eye shape, freckles, beauty marks; however it’s changed and you can no longer do that. Making everyone’s faces essentially the same. The added hairstyles are cool, but my face looks identical to the next person. In an update please add facial customization back :) yay!
Okay, for a girl who has braces, seeing this update doesn’t impress me that much anymore. I agree that it’s better, but it needs to be a bit more accurate. Maybe you can add braces and allow us to choose the color of our braces by tapping each bracket and choosing the colors. You can also let us choose how many brackets we need. And maybe, to make it more accurate, allow us to have grills on our bottom teeth. Otherwise, this update really made things better. I love it.
It’s overall a great app!!!but I wish I could mix and match clothes and create a customized clothes look instead of pre-matched clothes.And maybe accessories like watches and necklaces
Maybe u can add braces for a touch
this app is aight but WHY DINT THEY GAVE THICKER EYEBROW OPTIONS FOR WOMEN SORRY BUT I GOT CATERPILLARS AND BITMOJI SHOULDA BEEN KNEW
Okay.,! So let me tell y’all about this app called BITMOJI ! ! ! ! ! This is the best app for sc ( Snapchat ) etc.,
You should add casts for any part of the body and short or small, because I broke my wrist and if I could have a cast on my right arm so it would show me more!
Sorry but WHERE'S THE HIGHLIGHTS?!?!you guys said that there would be some highlights!!!other than that,GREAT GAME!!! So many things to chose from!😍😍😍
I can’t change my face marks/wrinkles or eye shape any longer?
listen, I love bitmoji, but it’s *definitely* time for some new outfit selections. also, with the bitmoji deluxe there are only 3 lip options, and none of them work for me. what about people with bigger lips?? I unfortunately have not been able to reap the benefits of the new curly hair options (thank you for those!) bc they’re only for deluxe, but with deluxe i’d have to chose lips that make my bitmoji no longer look like me. if you could put more lip options on deluxe that would be fantastic!!
They need to make an elongated goatee to match how I look come on guys you need to make s custom facial hair thing where people can draw or elongate or make facial hair smaller
There isn’t an outfit that comes off the shoulder or ripped jeans. We should be able to customize our outfits not pick from the choices
The new update is amazing! The characters look fantabulous! The app is more organized!
If you can add any anime related pics I would really love that! (For all Otakus and Weaboos out there!❤️)
I love this app! I use it with Snapchat a lot! It has very fun stickers and it is in general very cute! The new BitMoji Deluxe update is amazing this app just keeps on growing! I recommend buying it! -only downside is if you are using it you need WiFi/Cellular Data-  -Ema 🤪 
I think that if you were to add braces the Bitmojis would be more realistic because a lot of people have braces and there is currently no option for braces so I personally think that would be a great thing to add. Another thing that I think you could add is more choices on clothing because the clothing given is either sporty or has been there since fall or summer. And lastly I think you could is more eye colors because not all people have those eye colors. Maybe you could put like more mixes of colors into the eyes. Thank you for listening/reading and please consider these options
The app keeps telling me I have a network problem everytime I open it
I lOve Bitmoji!! It’s so cool!!!!!!
I don’t understand why I can’t get all the hairstyles!!
- more lip options -new clothes -beauty marks  - more dimples - more types of pulled up hair - less boxy shape 
I have braces and I would wish that you would add this feature, it’s kinda disappointing that you didn’t think of this but otherwise me and my friends have an awesome time competing to make the prettiest or ugliest bitmoji. Thanks for a great app!
stop doing so much stuff with snapchat it’s stupid and no one cares :)
I would appreciate it if you returned my fruit hat. It was very dear to me and I miss it very much. Thanks
I love he new update so much but when people told me there was an update I had my fingers crossed that there was braces for your teeth. Sadly there wasn’t😢
Bitmoji is so great I especially love the update because my hair is ombré but I was wondering if the braid could be ombré too I know it’s silly but it looks good with my character but it doesn’t really match me and I feel like you guys should really add me clothes to be honest..
Cannot update my bitmoji avatar with a “selfie”. Can’t enjoy the benefits of the updates.
Love this app and all my fiends use it but the females need new clothes. Can you add some wide leg jeans or wide leg pants and since we like to change our clothes often maybe some interchangeable options would work. Love the new options...but please some new clothes! Thanks
Bring Back Bitstrips!! I miss making my own comics!! I can still annoy people with Bimojis but Bitstrips was my hobby.
I think it is an awesome app... only thing is I wish you could make more than 1 avatar, that’s all I have to say otherwise astounding!!!
i really loke the new hairstyles but i still feel left out :( my hair is long but shaved sides. i have multiple friends with this hair cut also. do u think u can put this in? 🙏
I love the app and I love sending silly photos to my friends. After a lot of the ones we send, we make inside jokes and get even closer, but I have a few recommendations.  1- my friends love my dimples, but I have a lot of prominent freckles. We got into a large discussment about whether I should choose the have dimples or freckles on my bitmoji. So, I would love more of a variety of cheek lines, including one with dimples and freckles.  2- i think there should be a option to customize our own outfits. With this, I feel like we can convey our personalities even better.  3- this doesn’t really help me with anything, but I really think that there should be a third gender option that has all of the stuff like beards, hairstyles, and makeup. It can help even more people show off their personality with the funny emojis.  4- MORE HAIRSTYLES!!!!!! I would like Dutch/French braids, messier ponytails, and pigtails. With the hair styles I would also enjoy even more hair accessories such as athletic headbands.   If you have read all this, thank you for paying me our time to read my opinion. I hope that on one of the upcoming updates I see these options/changes.                                                    Sincerely, Charlotte🙃 
susan and bill love it
I think this app is great, but it could be better:  1. There aren’t any options for braces! I have braces and I think that’s a major part of who I am, so it’d be cool if my Bitmoji had them too.  2. I’d love it if I could mix and match outfits. That would be amazing.  3. There should be more sizes offered. I can’t find the right body size for me in Bitmoji and that’s sad  Overall, I love Bitmoji, but I’d love it more if it was improved! 
Please expand the lip selection
I love this app a lot❤️‼️but the outfits are getting boring. And I think u should update newer outfits and add more body shapes🙄💯
Every customization in the new Bitmoji Deluxe is really cool and realistic, but it would be perfect if there was head/body length and width. That is my only suggestion, otherwise great app; well done!
I think they should change the clothing styles. Make outs individually being able to choose our own styles. I was looking for something more emo or goth for my character but not much that I like. I love the app don’t get me wrong. I also think it would be neat if we could do our own kinda make things. Such as a example, freckles  I have them all over my nose but when I go they only have them on cheeks.
The ombré is not there plz halp
I love bitmoji! I think it is a great way to express yourself and your feelings! The only thing is, I think there should be other types of outfits like where you could pick a shirt, math it to some pants, and pick some shoes. That would be great!!
I Love Bitmoji, but I would really like it if y’all could add more beard styles and lengths. I have a longer beard and my Bitmoji doesn’t look much like me. Thanks!
I love bitmoji, but would love more outfit options for women. Everything kinda looks the same but just different colors. Would be awesome if we could mix and match outfit pieces and change the color/pattern of said pieces. I feel like the clothing is just blah with the options we have bc nothing really fits my style.
Please change cap's colors and outfits thanks
I love the new update that you can take a picture that creates an avatar of you. I have tried others apps that do this, but none of them has came close enough to create an avatar that looks like me.
I LOVE this app and like many others I have a bit of an addiction to it. I love this new style!! ❤️❤️❤️ But, I do think there could be some more things that could be added to make this app be even better.  1. For the female avatars I personally think there should be a wider verity in long hair styles. I was scrolling though and many of these styles were short and seemed more appropriate for the male avatars.  2. The clothing in the app hasn’t changed much which is kind of sad seeing that the new year is here and many fashion trends are on the rise. I think what would make it better would be if you could swipe though all the tops,pants, dresses, shoes, etc, and make your own outfit. Many people like to wear many different things, this would improve the app in many ways.  I do truly love this app. I just think that some improvements could be made to make it even better!! I hope you all agree! 
Can you please, please, please have collegiate outfits? And be sure to include The University of Iowa!
I love Bitmoji sooooo muchhhhh! But I wish they would make headphones and ear buds an option for headwear. Thanks so much! Love your app!
Loooove Bitmoji. Would be nice to add SEARCH bar feature to the app.
I love the app! It looks alot similar to me! The only problem is with the lipstick. It is a lil bright for a dark skin tone..
I give this a 5 star
If it’s not showing hair treatment options got to settings than select Bitmoji DELUXE style. Bitmoji’s a pretty nice app but  I think that you should be able to pick shirts, pants and etc. individually.
I’m a girl and all I have is boy hairstyles I mad because I knows there’s a braid I can’t get it no hair treatment option IM MAD
It’s almost perfect, there needs to be better skin options for olive to tan skin tones. There should be fuller lip options and longer straight hair and maybe one that has a flip style to it. And maybe more low cut shirts with leggings. And where’s the classic ugg boots!?
Pls
idk what your issue is with asian people. i have an asian friend that can’t make a bitmoji cause there are no. small. eyes. seriously?! i cant believe this. it’s 2018. get your stuff together. wE NEED ASIAN EYES. not everyone has eyes the size of friggin eggs.
Whoever took off the crown and made more hats. Your mom a hoe
The app displayed a message I could not read fast enough before it disappeared, said "Oops...." buttons on the bottom of app change to color when pressed but nothing happens. Setting button just keeps loading. I guess they no longer support iPhone 5. Sad as I just installed a new battery last month.
So I’m addicted to this app. I use it constantly. When I saw the new update, I was so excited. I couldn’t wait to add more accessories or outfits to my BitMe.  When I went in to the new app, it erased my cute avatar and replaced it with a troll. I mean, a troll version of me. I’ve spent an hour trying to regain my former avatar and I think it’s completely gone. I hate the new one, it looks nothing like me. Why did you do this?!?!? 
I have ombré hair so I want to have my Bitmoji have it too. But when I updated the hair treatment option wasn’t on my phone but my friend had it, I am really upset and confused Rn!!
The app is great just wondering if you can add skate wear to the clothing collection that’ll be so awesome!
We have way too much fun with this in our group chats!!  A couple of suggestions though:  1) Need an update that allows for a “group picture” in group messages, etc!  How fun would that be!!  2) Please put in a search bar for the actual app.  It’s nice to have it in the messages, but would be helpful in the app as well 😊  Thanks for the new hair color update!! 
Please make a lineman outfit with different color hard hats!
I love this app but I wish you would add one thing braces for people with them
Lol
I feel like all clothing options should be available to all bitmojis no matter what gender you assign to them while making them. Why can’t boy bitmojis access dresses/skirt outdoors? Why can’t girl bitmojis access “boy” clothes? And why can’t there be a gender neutral option for a gender when making bitmojis? Also for facial details, there are no scars. I know people who have scars on their face and don’t get to represent it with bitmojis. Just some suggestions, thanks.
Super glad you finally got diff hair colors and balayage/highlights and way more options to a lot of things. BUT what happened to mouth shape and size??!  Mouths are huge now... and what happened to the lines you can put around the mouth.. aka laugh lines 🤔. Let’s get those back ok?
Not a body type for us swole kriggas
if i have to be honest, Bitmoji is great. i love the little avatars. they're so cute! and i also love the new update where we finally, FINALLY got more options for hair and hair color. why did that addition take so long? i'd just like to suggest some things for Bitmoji that it's kind of lacking.  first of all, why do the Bitmoji Deluxe get the privilege of ombre hair but the Bitmoji Classics don't? i just don't understand why you limited the Bitmoji Classic's additions because that's my favorite avatar style and it deserves some more features that the other ones get. second of all, please allow more clothing options. the outfits are very limited and i rather be able to choose a shirt individually, pants individually, shoes individually etc. without a fully premade outfit that i 100% like except the shoes that it goes with. i'd really like some more customizable options there too... 
i wish it had more hair color options, more clothing styles, and access to piercings. i genuinely like this app but i feel like there needs to be more options as to what we wanna dress as or where our piercings are.
Silly costumes to choose from. That’s literally my only complaint. This recent update was good, and hopefully we’ll see more clothes and stuff come out.
I love the new update! Looks so much like me. The only thing is we need more options for mouths. That’s the one thing that’s off about myself.
It's great there's different lips but can you make it so we change the size of the mouth
I want my classic bitmoji back the new one can not be altered to look realistically like me
After you finish building your Bitmoji the nose does not look like the one selected. I tried several and they end up looking the same!!! Makes the Bitmoji look nothing like me.
My guy suddenly looks 30 years older than he did yesterday and the eyes all look ridiculous! He straight up looks like a crackhead who has bugged out eyes in all of his poses because Ralphie on 26th street ran out of the good stuff so he’s laced it with hidden valley powdered ranch to make it last longer.
right?
I love Bitmoji. Use it often. Only one suggestion. A search bar when directly in the Bitmoji app would be awesome. Request; Is there any way you could bring back the Game of Thrones theme?  Please. 😊
I loved the old cute bitmoji this new update horrible 😭😭😭 can we please go back to the cartoony bitmojis
the new deluxe version seems more limited actually. she looks nothing like me and there’s barely any face shape options to help
I would like to put braces on my bitmoji so people know more of what I look like and maybe more hair please? There is one that looks like mine. It’s kinda short but down to my shoulders and no offense but usually all the short ones are kinda ugly
I can’t wait till we can talk through our Bitmoji like we can with our emojis thanks to the new iPhoneX and also I’d like to see them have movement.... not like a fully animated GIF but more like hair suddenly blowing eyes blinking, or rolling #thatsagamechanger
Would be great if there was a search bar in the app like it was/is on my Note..& also if there were more customization available with the clothes, hair styles, and accessories  ***UPDATE***  Still no search bar on my iPhone app and hate the new look of the Bitmoji..I used to be able to make it look EXACTLY like myself but now it looks weird since the update (the face shape, nose, lips, and eyes, etc.)..I do love the added hair and colors & accessories but the clothes options are still lacking. 
the pizza prayer bitmoji is gone and that was my signature mitmoji, this is almost as bad as the new snapchat update
This app is awesome. I love having a mini me in the screen. And I appreciate the new bitmoji delux. However I’m still finding trouble finding the right hair for my new bitmoji. Before I used the poofy curls but now they look completely different. It’d be nice to have a few more realistic hair designs. Also, the outfits, I just wanna scroll through more options and exchanging clothes with one another instead of having a complete outfit done alone. I can’t find any that really suit me. These are just suggestions but overall I do believe the app is amazing and I like what it portrays. Continue doing the awesome work!
The app is great just add more clothes please
Absolutely love the New Update!♥️🙌🏼 But I was really hoping to have the option of adding a beauty mark to our avatar!😞 Personally that would give mine the final touch! Lol 😂 Hopefully you guys take this into consideration.😊🤞🏼🙏🏼 But other than that I love it!💕
I LOVE the new Bitmoji but I wish y’all would add piercings into the mix, mine looks like me just missing the studs I have in my face lol
Can you please add facial piercings to bitmoji !!!! For example like septum piercing, nose rings , studs !!! That’d be awesome !!!
Love it, but I wish there was an option to choose glasses color. My glasses are way too close to my hair color and blend with it too much :/ Also the difference between the two heaviest options in body type is way too drastic 😂😂 I think it would be nice to have a more flattering-looking option also, as Bitmojis are simplified people anyway lol
This was cool but to much storage
It’s a cool thing but I wish they had my haircut on here lol☹️ I got the Odell cut and they don’t have it
Love the love app! But I have braces and I want my Bitmoji to look more like me, so it would be nice in the next update, you can add braces for teeth!
I like it a lot now with the update ! I will suggest thought to let me have options like freckles and dimples together xD cause i have both !  I will like more superhero outfits ! Also i always wear a single flower on the side and there is no option for that ! Only flower crowns!  Other than that, great job! 
But still waiting on a gap-tooth feature...
Do you think you guys could do like mermaid hair, unicorn hair or split hair?! Like something more colorful?! I know I’m picky but my hair is split blue and orange, I just wanted to see if you would do it
Finally found that avatar I was looking for. 5 stars!
I see this continuing theme of your users wanting more variety and options when it comes to the clothing factor and I 100% agree. There’s so many ways already to customize, especially now with the bitmoji deluxe, but the outfits are pretty well basic and unoriginal. At one point in time I had three friends who’s bitmojis all had on the same outfit. I like seeing how far this app has actually come and using the stickers make conversations through messages more lively, I just wish we had the ability to be more creative with the clothing options.
Yo a good idea would be earrings. So uh, add em.
I know that u do have curly hair but I would love to have curly hair that isn’t super poofy! I know u have ONE that’s not super poofy but it doesn’t fit my style (or my friends :/ ). It would be amazing if you add hair that’s like curly but not super big. Like ringlets and kinda intense waves
how about adding some tattoos and piercings to it? that’s make it 10/10 and way more unique to each person.
I would love to see olympic bitmoji’s go USA!
I’ve noticed that in the girls hair section there isn’t a side shave and I really hope u take the time to add that it
great app! love the new additions!! I’m pushing for earrings and nose piercings!
This update is totally awesome! Love the ends realistic hair and character things!
BRING BACK THE ATHLETIC BODY TYPE!!! Not sure why you took it away. You guys at Bitmoji obviously don’t lift. Bring back my athletic body type and I will give a better rating.
How come it didn’t update for me?
Everything is perfect, we just really need more clothes options.
can you please make more mouth choices my mouth doesn’t look like any of them
Really love this app & every idea in it, as you know we all have suggestions, mine would be to add more skin tones...i am hispanic and so I’m a complicated kind of tan tone. So my bitmoji looks white right now but i would love for it to be tanner, just putting that out there. Also hair options like a regular fade with straight hair on the top and all that. & also clothing options with more popular stuff and to combine clothing items. Other than that i really like it tho :)
Love the two color option. But some of the hairstyles can’t have two colours. You should make it to where all hairstyles can have two or more hair colours. Add more body types.  And more clothes. And an earring option for Bitmoji deluxe
I really enjoy his app and the new updates but I think a really cool feature to add would be if you could take a picture of your car or dog or maybe even any animal so you could have a sidekick with you
Like most apps and games. Where is the long hair for the curly headed girls like me?! All the new styles are just more straight and wavy styles. I love the short curly style but my hair is almost all the way down my back. Add more hair options :(
I don’t have the ombré portion
I feel like things are always missing. I've been searching for a white top with a black skirt with gloves for my bendy oc. I want more additions to options, such as some people's favorite YouTubers and games.
Horrible update. I want to use the picture feature and it is absolutely crap! Doesn’t work to save a life!
The app is amazing don’t get me wrong(hence the 5 star rating) but there are only 3 lip options which is kinda annoying. I’m someone who has very full lips, my lips are a very noticeable and distinct part of my face. I just think there should be more lip options there are other things too like makeup options but I don’t feel like typing that much so... BUT PLEASE ADD MORE LIP OPTIONS AND PIERCING OPTIONS.
I do like the upgrades but there are 3 types of Bitmojis. I like the deluxe, by my hair style is not there are not many clothes to choose from....very basic. We should be able to mix and match our own style.
I love Bitmoji! I think its so cool that you can create a mini you and connect it to snapchat and “interact” with your friends. I wish in the next update you can customize the outfit more. Such as add new items and mix and match clothing to create more of a custom look. Thank you for considering my suggestion.
One simple request: MORE CLOTHING OPTIONS. I get bored with my outfit within a week or two. Should be a complete shoe section, shirt section, pants/shorts, etc.
Would be five stars but waves aren’t in the hairstyles
Only good thing about Snapchat with this bougie update going on
Bitmoji is really great, I just want to suggest something that will make the app even more fun. Instead of CHOOSING an outfit, what if you separate all the jackets, shirts, shoes etc. and everyone can make their own outfits by choosing what jacket they want with this shirt, pair of shoes and jeans.
But why so few items of head gear that's free? Yeah, lots of new stuff, if you want to pay for it all. SMH
I LOVE Bitmoji more then any app in the world I always use it to text my friends and family it knows just what I want to say so I don’t have to say it❤️❤️ I would like though if you could have it where you could look up things inside the app not just on text😃 YOU SHOULD GET BITMOJI😍
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THE LONGEST TIME TO SEE IF YOU PUSHED OUT SOME SOCCER JERSEYS BUT NOOOOOOO I WANNA WEAR A BARÇA SHIRT BUT NAHHHHHHHH
Love this app! Would love the option for multiple ear piercings/nose/septum/lip piercings, for those of us who like to pretend we’re pincushions! :)
I love the new upgrade!!!! The customizations allow you to do more with your Bitmoji appearance.  The one thing I would suggest for the future would be to provide customizable outfits. Some of the outfits are amazing, and some pieces from an outfit would look better with a different outfit piece. It would be very optimal to customize your outfit just like you customize your hair, eyes, face features, etc. 
App keeps crashing!!!!
Hey!! Bitmoji update 9/10!!! Only missing facial piercings like septum / eyebrow / lips. That sorta makes someone’s “look” sometimes so it’s important to be represented as who I am!  Thanks for listening to the feedback! :) 
So I love bitmoji and think it’s great but the options are a little limited, there arnt choices for people who have their hair dip dyed a different color
I love how this app allows people to incorporate their different identities! It includes minority looks/hair/face/etc. They're recent deluxe upgrade is my favorite! Keep doing what you're doing bitmoji :)
The old Bitmoji was great! Then they released this new update which is even better! But...there’s only 1 way to dye your hair, I don’t really like that cuz I didn’t dye the tips of my hair, I dyed the front. And with the new hair styles, there no short hair, parted in the middle. That’s it! Just short hair, parted in the middle, that’s all I want! And, with the face lines, if you tap on one there’s no way to get rid of it unless you chose a different one but I don’t want any face lines on my avatar! PLEASSSE fix these things now! I can’t use a Bitmoji that looks like a completely different person!!!
I was gonna add the bishop hat but then the stupid update got rid of it for no reason. Put it back
My bitmoji cannot look like me without my beauty mark.
They should make a soccer league clothes like la liga
This app is amazing but I just wish they had cuter outfits
There are no outfits for the Olympics! Fail!
Theres only ombre no highlights!! Thank you and please add new outfits!!!
Why can’t I download this app again for free ? it’s keep making me put in billing information for it , before the Snapchat update I deleted it n ever since it won’t let me download it back without paying or putting in credit card information
Oops something went wrong! Try again. Errors upon errors.
I can’t seem to use the ombré affect because when I go to hairstyles it only has the hairstyle and the main color it doesn’t give me a second option to color the bottom of my hair please help
They FINALLY add more feature for your bitmoji. Im glad that I can put 5 different turbans on my bitmoji now but STILL do not have a chinstrap option for facial hair 🤦🏻‍♂️
Yes it’s true I shared this app with all the people I know and %100 of them love it! (But I love it more!). In my opinion, BitMoji is a fun and awesome app for everyone to enjoy. Except for one thing... we need more outfits!         To anyone that’s criticizing me for writing this, hold on! There’s a reason why I’m writing this. I understand BitMoji has had an above awesome update (which I also love) but ever since I’ve actually used this app daily and designed my BitMoji more realistically now, I feel like I need a new outfit.         So in conclusion, to the creators of BitMoji, don’t work yourselves to hard. But please make new outfits for males and females or at least consider it!        I am Race: African American; Age: 10; Gender: Female . 
I really enjoy the app but I think you should be able to make multiple avatars
The update makes it impossible to make it look more like me. Im 17 and my guy looks like he’s 45. Also you deleted almost every hat and made them more feminine..
My friend and I think it would be a good idea to be able to save different outfits and maybe even having a thing to set when your outfit changes like pajamas and a everyday outfit? I don’t know it seems better! I always can’t choose what to make my bitmoji wear! Please do this!
Please add more styles of clothes and options to pick our own tops and bottoms and shoes
When will be able to add tatts to our bitmoji???
I had downloaded this app and unfortunately immediately found it wouldn’t work for me- the first screen asks to pick a gender and then only gives options for male and female. Quite frankly that’s a deal breaker for me, someone who is neither. I would suggest changing the page to have you select a body type or silhouette and have a more curvy one and a less curvy one. And then allow for choosing long hair and beards at the same time or eyeshadow and mustaches. Making this app more inclusive would honestly be so so wonderful and I know it would definitely gain you at least one user (me!)
Hey! I love this app and would definitely recommend to everyone. One idea though, could you guys make Drum Corps uniforms/marching band uniforms an outfit choice? You’d definitely take a good grip on the music industry. I really hope to see this in an update soon. Thanks!!
Can y’all put redneck clothes on there for he rednecks?
I love this I just wish that they would have facial piercings. Other than that I absolutely love this app.
I hate the new update i want my old bitmoji back
First I liked the original face patterned but this update will do. HOWEVER, can we get accessories like jewelry... earrings at least.
I love using this but I have a suggestion. You guys should add the ‘saving multiple avatars’. So when u want to play around with the outfits and things, you don’t have to go through all the outfits again to find your old one and you can have different looks all at one click of a button. Like switching from avatar (A) to (B) without having to find everything again.
I like the new hair and I also like how it takes a picture of you and that’s how it’s used!❤️❤️❤️❤️
We need more clothes in bitmoji!!!! Otherwise great app! Love the new style!
My bitmoji turned from cute into stoned serial killer please change it back
Yo, would it kill you guys to add short beard facial hair but no mustache?
Love the update! More details to our bitmojis. However, not everyone is participating, which is a shame.
Please.
It’s a good app and I like that’s it’s with Snapchat. I love the new update with the hair and stuff but I would like if we could do more personal outfits and create our own outfits. Or mix and Match clothes.
I love bitmoji— especially the new version. There’s finally a curly hair option that resembles my hair! They’ve added a lot more options for different people. Only thing I would also love to see is facial piercings!
Can you guys provide facial features such as a mole being on either side of you cheek and anywhere on your face. Better hairstyles and more natural look hairstyles for African Americans. Better clothing and being able to pick separate clothing items rather than just outfits
Hey can we get like a 1970s Afro as one of the hairstyles please
Great app. I love how it works on not only Snapchat but keyboard. I also really like the clothes. You can choose from REAL clothes brands on the app, Plus every season the clothes change! (New season releases)
There is no split hair dye and the eyes shapes almost the same there no deference!
I feel like that can't be that hard to make pajama outfits and sweatpants, bathing suit, formal attire like suits and gowns, retro outfits, cuter everyday clothes options, as well as options for people from other ethnic backgrounds, and more options for pregnant women. You're underestimating how much that matters to people. Your app would be 1000 times more fun.  Update: I like the new hair styles but why did you get rid of some of the old ones!! Bring them back. Also I’m still waiting for new clothes options. 
I really like it but I wish you could make multiple characters
Don’t like the new Avatar.
How is there still no search bar in the app?!
Bring back the CROWN . I got to say my old bitmoji looked exactly like me but with this new update I can’t seem to find anything that looks like me . I definitely took it of my Snapchat I want the old version back
There's limited options for beards and mustaches!!! For me I have a handlebar mustache and there's no option of implementing that into my Bitmoji! I'll rate it higher once the handlebar mustache becomes a custom option!  Update: Finally the handlebar mustache has been added which is awesome but I can’t seem to combine it with the beard features?! 4 stars seems quite fair since I can’t have both the handlebar mustache and beard. 
This new update ruined the chance of my old bitmoji and when I try to login from my Snapchat to bitmoji to get it back it takes me to the new bitmoji which I really hate
Since the new update, can’t log into my app at all. Please fix!
Is there anyway we can get more options on the outfits
Love all the new realistic options!!!
I love using the bitmoji app! It is so much fun to send stuff to my friends and also have my friends’ bitmojis alongside mine. I hope in the future y’all can make it where 3 or more bitmojis can be in one sticker. Also, if we could customize our own clothes, that would be great!
I had to take my Bitmoji keyboard off because if I accidentally hit the picture it automatically sends it, and I ended up sending one at a kind of bad time and I had to quickly explain myself so it kinda sucked.  For a future update could you do jewelry? For an example, I have my belly button pierced and my bitmoji has a crop top on so it’d be cool to give her one as well. 
Not impressed with how real the bitmojis look. I loved the animated version better. New skin tones would fit better with the old animated version!
the app needs to introduce facial/ ear piercings asap!
I’m actually ok with this app
I love the new deluxe thing, hair, and other things. I feel like there should be more body shapes and more feature.
I love the new update it's really cool. I just have one problem with it.. YOU TOOK MY CROWN!!!!! GIVE IT BACK!!!! I need it.
ok so why tf do y’all have ombré but not my highlites🙂. like okkk #notcool #notrad #bringhighlitesnotcrustyombre 😤
I hate the new update!! I want my old bitmoji back but I’ll never be able to get it again :(
I adore all the new features and changes made. It’s one of my favorite applications. The features are very sleek and simple to use and unique
Could you add more curvier bodies for the body types like a hourglass shape and a pear body shape because I gotta big booty and I wanna show that through my character
just a suggestion.. but you should make an option to put braces on your bitmoji!
I love bitmoji it is so much fun to use!
Not sure if anyone will see this (or will even care tbh) but the new bitmoji deluxe is great and everythang. I love how my bitmoji looks BUT being a girl with long 3b curly hair... I felt as though my hair type wasn’t really included in the hair selections available for my new bitmoji. I’m upset about that but das it.
can you add a white headband please?
The app is phenomenal!!  The only thing missing is more outfits. You guys answer a lot of my concerns with the deluxe update but WE NEED MORE OUTFITS!
I love Bitmoji, and I adore the Bitmoji deluxe, but for some reason I can’t figure out how to do highlights. My hair has natural highlights and they stick out, and I can’t find a color to make my hair like it is. So can you make it easier to find how to do this. Maybe have your hair section, but then another folder in the section you can pick a color and select where you want your ombré, Balayage, or highlights , then select your second color. And maybe we could take a picture of our outfit and then the app can make and outfit look like ours. Thank you for your time.                       -McKenna Kime                              NY 
Did you guys add any Islamic attire, Bitmojii should be more diverse. 🧕🏼 like hijabs and over garments, even for men as well
I really like the app.. It’s a lot of fun.. However,  I know several people that are amputees.. I was wondering if maybe you guys could come up with a limb removal option.. I mean, just to make this a real rendition of someone who is now without a limb or two.. This isn’t a joke.. My father lost his leg, and I also have a few friends who have lost legs to various life situations.. Thanks for reading and I hope to see the option to remove a leg if applicable..
Can you bring it back or redevelop it,  Bitmoji is cool but the bitstrips is what made my days 👌🏾
I LOVE bitmoji....they’re cute, funny, and people love to receive them! But with as many awesome features as bitmoji deluxe has, it does not allow you to change the size of your mouth/smile and completely changes how your avatar looks. Really wanted to love the new update, but not to the point where my avi doesn’t even resemble me.
Could you add a curly textured Tapered Haircut. Thank you
Good update
I think that Avatar style is awesome. I would just like better shades of nudes in lipsticks, better eyeshadows and more outfits. Besides that, it’s pretty awesome.
Won’t let me use the new update
I absolutely love Bitmoji! I love how popular it’s become, even my grandparents have Bitmoji. However, I felt like the new update offered a ton of options for clothing, make-up, accessories and such, but not enough options on facial/body features. All of the mouth options are super wide and the eye options are also limited. I feel like more mouth size and general mouth options are needed. The mouth in the new update is so distinct that since it is wide it automatically makes the Bitmoji look nothing like me so I switched back to the old version. As for the eyes, I think you’ve got the shapes down, but the eye angles in the new update are very limiting, it makes many of them look the same. I do like that the eye size is now customizable. At the end of the day I don’t care if I have a million clothing and accessory options if I can no longer get the Bitmoji to look like me.
I enjoy the new bitmojis and think they’re really awesome. Although you should include more body types. I’m heavier, but I’m not stomach heavy I’m bottom heavy.   Also, it took me almost 15+ to get the customization screen to even open. It kept crashing. And it continues to do this. I was able to finally get passed it. But haven’t been able to get passed it since, and when I do it crashes before I can save. 
How is it possible that now my avatar looks like 9 year boy .. it used be better like a young person not a little boy
I like all the costumes but I think you guys should make a cowboy costume it would be cool 🙏🏽🤠
the new update is so cute however some of the “poses” for the bitmojis are terrible. for example: the dabbing one. 0/10. consider removing.
i wish there were more maternity outfits. the ones already up here are not my style. or either allow there to be a “pregnant” option so that our bitmoji can wear all of the outfits.
I love using this app through text and snapchat etc. With the new update it is even 10x better and so much more realistic, I just wish that there were Multiple piercing options for our BITMOJI that would make them even more resembling to our real selves I hope they become an option
So I’ve played around with the new deluxe bitmoji a lot recently and it made me realize y’all didn’t do much with the outfits well here’s a simple suggestion can Chang that. Keeping it simple: 1. Keeping the normal outfits tab for anyone who wants to keep it simple with a put together outfit ready to wear. Spicing things up: 2. For anybody who wants to spice up their bitmoji, adding individual clothing parts tabs to make custom outfits Additional Clothing: 3.  Shoes tab: vans,convers,Nike,Jordan’s,yeezys, etc. New Shirts: (I’m centering this around skater clothing because this style trend has been lacking in bitmoji) thrasher,spitfire,huf,etc. New Pants: sagging, ripped, skinny jeans, loose fit jeans, sweatpants etc. Underwear: (mainly used if sagging pants option is chosen) Hanes,Calvin klein, etc. Ice (jewelry) tab: Assorted chains, watches, grills, gold, diamonds, etc. Extra additions: 4. Being able to set new actionmoji logos (ex. Different plane/car/headphone actionmoji’s) New skateboard/bike actionmoji when going 5-10 mph on map 
Okay thank you for the new update I love the hairstyles and the fact that you can add highlights in your hair. There should be more outfit choices and it would be so cool if there were piercings for your bitmoji too
So everything’s great but i really wish that i could design my own persons clothes. like get to pick the pants, shirts, etc. also necklaces nose rings and studs would be great too!
i think i’d be cool if a feature was added to where you could customize the outfit on your bitmoji w the stuff that’s already in the app. like mix and match stuff. i play w my bitmoji’s looks so much, &  that would make it so much more fun.
Bitmoji updated on my iPhone but for some reason the hair or any other new features are not there🤷🏾‍♀️
So. I love bitmoji. A couple things: First  I ❤️ the new bitmoji deluxe! One sad part about it tho is that the sides of the glasses overlap the hair on some of the bitmoji pictures you can send. No one Wears there glasses like that and it look SUPER BAD. Please fix!!!  Also, I have written like 5 reviews saying the exact same thing, and seen lots of other reviews saying the same thing as I’m saying. Here it is AGAIN:  Please PLEASE let us mix and match clothing articles or design our own outfits. How hard could that be to add to the app? I have a very unique style, and I really want my bitmoji to reflect that. We want to be able to express ourselves correctly. 
Just imagine if the old update came back (or at least the chats and stories separate) then the ratings on Snapchat would be 4.1 too but instead they are 3.0 lmaoooo
I see bitmoji getting a lot bigger if they keep adding content. Extensive customization would be key to making bitmoji even better. This recent update added so much to the app👀
First of all make it a showroom style, where you can just try on all the different clothes and save each piece individually.  Next, the clothing articles should be split into categories (hats/shirts/pants/accessories/shoes) and be accessed in a way that is similar to the avatar designing features.   Would also be nice to have more accessories such as watches, sports compression socks and such for athletes, necklaces, etc.  Overall the wardrobe feels more clunky and less developed than the rest of the app. 
Y’all need to add a birthmark feature 😤 I have a noticeable birthmark on my face and my bitmoji isn’t me without it 😂 other than that I love this app but that’s all I want come on even wii characters have that 💀👏
UDPATE: Thank you for this new update. It speaks to me in so many levels to be able to find a skin tone that I identify with as well as seeing all the new options for hair texture and style, religious head coverings, and overall diversity of the product. You have made me and many of my friends so happy. Thank you again!  Old: I love this app but I cannot find a skin color that matches me. Maybe changing to a gradient would work better. If not could you please develop some more colors in the medium brown range? Some more color variation in the first 3x3 blocks of choices. 
I love what the new update brings when it comes to customization of bitmojies! However, I do wish there were better clothing options for males. The ones now just aren’t cutting it for me, and my high sense of fashion.
I was excited to try out the new update but keeps crashing on the tutorial.
make a create
Bitmoji is overall good, and I really like the new deluxe version. I only wish there was more variation in the clothing, like if you could be able to mix and match articles of clothing. Where my Bitmoji looks extremely similar to me, I don’t really wear any of the clothes. It’d be cool if you could change the colors of items of wear this shirt with these pants and those shoes so you can personalize it to fit what you’d normally wear. Other than that, nothing else to say! Pretty good :)
Bitmoji has definitely progressed since i’ve started using it & don’t get me wrong i love it. But my friends and i noticed that there isn’t much of a big maternity selection, it would be great if you could make your actual avatar pregnant instead of having to choose from the small selection of maternity clothing.
I love bitmoji. Interested in checking out Bitmoji Deluxe, Buy bitstrips has always been my favorite style. I Love that I can use it in Snapchat and via the keyboard to copy/paste or via iMessage app. What I don’t like is that native app doesn’t allow searching so I can’t easily find images to save. It’s a good thing they keyboard plugin allows searching. But it’s annoying I can’t search the main app and can’t easily find something and save to my camera roll. I like to save things in case they remove them.
My Bitmoji looks literally nothing like me no matter what now. It looked like me before but now it’s like none of the features work.
Lots of new options = great. But the face looks too long on some of the pictures like the ‘lol’ one. On other faces, the eyes don’t look right. It’s glitchy - the old faces didn’t do that.
add more or customizable outfits pls thanku
love the update but for some reason when i put the longer hair on my bitmoji other people see it as shorter hair. i can see the longer hair on my phone, but it’s not on anyone else’s.
Braces, piercings and pet customizations would be amazing!
I love this app so much! Especially the cool new update! Sometimes it’s really hard to choose between the avatar styles because they’re so pretty💗thank you guys so much for making this app for Snapchat cause it’s really cool🌀although it would be even cooler if you guys added braces/more accessories to the avatar and more choices of clothing👗thank you💘😁
With all the upgrades that were made to the avatar recently can’t believe y’all still missed the mark on the maternity section. No updates to maternity outfits and no update to include maternity as a body type instead of just a wardrobe option. Would love to see an option where maternity could be a body type and all clothes could be an option for someone who’s pregnant. 😫
I love the bitmojis and I’m so happy you just added the NHL team outfits but can You Please!!!!! Add StarWars one’s and if you do please Kylo Ren!!!!
Worst Part Of Creating A “Look Alike” Character Is When You Can’t Really Get It To Look Like You. You Can Make It Resemble Or Maybe Create Your Own Character.But The Main Issue Is Not Getting The Look You Really Are.First Problem With Me Personally Is There’s Chin Strap W/o Goatee would be a Start for those who don’t have mustaches. You Guys Have To Remember How Big And Diverse The App Really Is.You Have Children,Different Weight Classes, Different Cultures & People With Their Own Unique Style Who Have & Use This App.Also Another Fix Would Be A Skin Tone adjuster(swipe to the tone that best fits ) also those tones to fade into each other for The Best Tone For That User.( Instead Of Just Colors In A Box Shows More Interest In Getting That  “Perfect You” Touch. I’m Just New To The App And Already See The App Could Use A Lot Of Work. Would Greatly Appreciate It If You Could Take These Adjustments Under Consideration I’m Sure Others Would Too I Could Post More Ideas To Better This App. If You Do Ever Read This &/Or Make Those Changes I Would Love To Always Give Ideas To Better The App As An User & The More I Actually Get To Use It.(Just .To Be The More Proactively Thinker) But In Some Cases It Could Be Funding.(I’m Not Sure How Old The App Actually Is) This Is My Opinion As A First Time User I Mean No Harm Overall The App Is GREAT. Just A lot of Room For More Up To Date & User Friendly Adjustments.
Thank You for creating a thing such as Bitmoji so you can create your own person that look exactly like yourself it’s almost the best thing ever invented on the internet I rated it 5 stars because it’s the best thing ever
New update is awesome, I’m a mixed girl and I found my hair type! Not exact, but way closer than the old one. Only thing is there’s a lack of clothing options. You should totally make an awesome variety and abundance of new outfits. There’s a ton of cultures and styles out there, tons of things you can do, putting it nicely :)
Not enough options for curly hair/ braided hair
As an asian woman I am slightly upset that there are no asian eyes. I want to remind bitmoji that there is a difference between looking tired and looking asian. Fix this or I won’t be using this app in the future, many of my other asian colleagues would agree. Why use an app that is supposed to make a character look like you when your races features aren’t even on the app.
How could you take away the pizza selfie? How?
My update does not contain the hair treatment option...
I love this app but for the new version of bitmoji there is no hair that looks like mine and I have the most simple hair plz try make more and hair and diversely so I can have one for myself (im a boy btw) and also can u make it so all bitmojis can wear all clothes so boys can wear dresses and girl things and vise versa for girls thxs sooo much!!
Different lip shapes would be awesome. They change your overall face look so much. Also three or four body types with the only change in chest size? Huh?!
i updated it but i don’t have any of the features like the hair ?
I already liked Bitmoji before but now I love it because it added more ethnic hairstyles amongst other things. Now my Bitmoji can have the same hair I have when I wear it natural 😁
Since the update, the Bitmoji are disgusting little monsters
WHY!!!!!!!!!!!
Hopefully in the next update they’ll link this app with snapchat for changing bitmoij’s avatar features. That’s the only reason I use this app; after I change my bitmoij’s look I delete the app because it seems like wasted space you can you for large documents you may have. Also can there be more hairstyles and complexions because it’s very limited bc what if you have none of the hairstyles that are giving and what do you do if they don't have your skin complexion.?
This idea is awesome, it works really well for me, keep up the good work!
You guys should add a Bruce Lee costume from game of death and enter the dragon👌🏼
Don’t the new update at all! Wish you would of made this “new” bitmoji just an option instead of our only choice.
I like the Bitmoji app I really do but after I updated it I was seriously missing the hairstyle I had on my old Bitmoji it’s no longer there. I love that you can have two hair colors now but I really want you guys to bring back the old hairstyles I really loved. I liked my old Bitmoji way better. Please bring them back!
Love the HUGE improvement on the face. Now let’s work on the bod. It’s too thin (the arms, legs). Love the more variety of accessories and all that but the body needs work.
I’m not able to make my hair ombré
I like that we finally got an update, but you got rid of a bunch of things that I really liked: my simple ponytail; my face shape. I want my old bitmoji back.
Plz add an option where you can have two different color hair. I have blind and brown so plz!!!
hey make more curly hair options please n thx
I really enjoy these app I use it all the time but...I think something you. Guys could add on it would be more outfits and brands like supreme and bape and things like that it would make a big difference...THANK you!
Can we just build our outfits? The outfits that are already put together are kinda terrible. Give us a shirt section, bottoms section, shoe section, accessories section, etc
My 3D not working on my Snapchat and I updated everything and I got an iPhone 7 😒
Don’t like the deluxe, and idk why when I go to look at mine it looks weird...
I love this app and the update. All of my friends' Bitmojis look so much like them thanks to the selfie option. Mine won't work though! When I take the selfie, nothing happens. I even reset my avatar and it didn't work. Please help.
This app is good, very creative. However, I am continually frustrated that there is no search option in the app itself. Having to scroll through a million choices just to find a subject is time consuming.  I do not wish to add this as a shortcut to my keyboard for privacy reasons, but rather I am using the app itself. 
They used to be so cute and now they're really ugly and once you tried hanging your bitmoji to the new style you can't change it back. Now i have no bitmoji on snapchat bc the new one is so ugly
I love the “bitmoji deluxe” and how it was updated to be more inclusive. I just think that there needs to be more hairstyles for curly hair that is bouncy, springy curls. There is only one option that is between wavy curly and coily curly, which isn’t a bad option but I wish there was more to choose from. The clothes also need to be updated because they hardly ever update which leads to having little options when wanting to change.
Takes up storage, just add it on the the Snapchat app
hello, let me just begin by saying i love bitmoji! but a lot of times you see the same things in the reviews: more options for everything. usually hair styles, hair/skin colors, clothes, etc. there is one thing i never see requested though: piercings! i always felt like my bitmoji looked like me but was missing something and i recently realized it was probably my nose ring. just maybe add an option for facial piercings or even a couple other ear piercings 🤷‍♀️ i’m sure people would love it. thanks for your consideration Ɛ>
The new bitmojis look so ugly i just want my old one back
higher ponytails would be nice
I do like this app but it’s just at the ‘ok’ stage for me. Others can disagree. It may meet others needs just fine but let me tell you what my first reaction was to this app. “What?! Why aren’t their more options for body types?” Seriously though? WHY? Everything else about this app is pretty good but you need to work on the variety!
I think that you should add more body shapes, add something where you can change teeth style, and more outfits choices
I see that Bitmoji has all the first responders except for EMTS/Paramedics. It would be nice if Bitmoji could add those to the “Work it” attire.
I think we should be able to design our clothes, theres a lot of outfits i wish i could make the pants different or the shirt different or have a choker with. Some of the styles just arent me, or in colors id never wear. I want my bitmoji to be a bit more personal.
These new faces are NOTHING like before! Loving the fact that there’s more features, more colors, more choices (eyebrows, hair textures, etc) HOWEVER the faces you guys are providing are absolutely terrible!
The new options make for a more realistic avatar but my one disappointment is the mouth is huge and unattractive in all the laughing or smiling options. Looks like a wooden ventriloquist dummy mouth. Everything else is awesome. I just choose ones that aren’t laughing when I send them. All other face and hair options are great.
Everytime I try to sign in it says login error.. Wifi or not, I can never log in. Ridiculous
Installed only to use 3d bitmoji, no one can tell me why it’s the only aspect of the app that doesn’t work for me. 1 Star.
I found out why mine were not posting. Now I'm having fun w/ this app.
Add earrings !! I have 1/2 in tunnels in my ears and would be cool if my bitmoji could have it too !!! Also , maybe other types or piercings / tattoos !
The new Bitmoji is pretty awesome. I love all the extra options for personalization but it would be nice to have more clothing options, especially for the maternity section
I didn’t know when the Update happened but I just noticed it and it’s amazing! My Bitmoji actually looks just like me now! I love it!
Please add more lips options
Four skinny sizes then jump to one big. Better outfits for the bigger folks.
Can we still use them on snap cause i don’t see the filter anymore
So you have 4 almost identical skinny body types and then straight to extra large. You should probably work on that.  I’m somewhere in the middle. Certainly not skinny and definitely not a beach ball on popsicle sticks. For real.
My suggestion is to give me my old hair back. I accidentally changed my hairstyle and you removed my old one. It was the only hairstyle that looked like mine. Please give it back to me.
can we get thinner mustaches ?
Y’all could make it where you could choose your shirt, pants, dress, skirt, or shoes. And you don’t have to pick from the option that everyone else has. None of the clothes listed I wear, I wear athletic pants and a jacket, but that’s not there... if you read this thx!!
You guys made variations for the skinny body type, but I’m stuck between too small and too big. Can we get some variety for the bigger girls too?
Update: I originally gave this app a three star rating until the update and I am shaking. Bitmoji, you have, indeed, solved the color issue. For that, I will add one star to my rating...Until you do something about the clothes *hint*hint*  Original Review: The bitmoji app is definitely fun, but not the most original. It’s definitely a fad that will eventually fade away, like all of its predecessors and successors after it. The app itself is pretty basic, and stays on trend which is convenient and funny. But, personally, I would prefer a full color spectrum. When creating your bitmoji, you only get a few color choices. Creativity is key. People should have the ability to color their hair any shade of any color they want, such as dark purple...  Thank you. 
I love the new upgrade on the app but I HATE THE FACT NO CHINGY EYES.. like I know it’s in a cartoon form but they could’ve at least added slanted eyes, now my cartoon don’t look crap like me !! Like comeee onnnnn .. like I don’t even want a Bitmoji anymore since she don’t even look like me.. can you guys just please add slanted eyes please. So my avatar can resemble me please. Thank you
Finally some ombré options and more colors. Now just need some clothing mix n match
I wish i could search for a specific feeling in the app, but you’re only allowed to choose from 6 tabs. There are tons of bitmojis to choose from but it takes forever to find the exact one to describe your feeling or mood. For example, if i want to search pregnant, i’m sure there are emojis to describe that, but i’d have to scroll to search for it. There should really be a search bar available to speed up the process 
While I commend the move toward much more diverse options 👏, my perfect bitmoji now looks NOTHING like me. I have medium curly hair and this option has been wiped with no alternative. The jaw lines look weird as hell and nose options are all too big. I accidentally saved my changes and now my avatar that had for years is gone. My bitmoji days have come to an end. 😭 😭
Update my my bitmoji look ugly n now me crush doesn’t like me anymore
really great and fun app! i would like to see more hair style, clothing, and accessories. it would be awesome to see dutch braids since a lot of girls have been wearing braids these days. i would like if we were able to choose tops and bottoms seperately as well. adding different piercings would be a plus also. industrial piercing, nose piercing, septum, eyebrow piercing etc.  EDIT 2.7.18 i like all the new hair styles and colors but wat happened to the old hair styles? why add new hair styles but take off the old ones? just leave them. also same with accessories, like a lot of hats are gone and the head phones 
Love the new choices but 3 choices for the mouth?? None of them look like me, the old one had way more. Please add in the next update, it looked a lot more like me before and it’s not allowing me to go back :(
Make it where u bitmoji can have braces
Bring it back! It was so convenient 😪
Love this app and love how much better it has gotten, I wish they had more outfits, I’m a very laid back person and I wish they had more options, also they don’t have any per say “country” outfits, I wear cow girl boots and jeans daily and would love to see that added
The new art style is lit now all I want is a game with the characters similar to The Sims Social and I'll be in heaven
I love bitmoji especially the new styles but I think it could used some alternative/ emo hair and clothing something for people who aren’t so basic
Love the new update but it’s really annoying that in most animations the glasses appear over the hair. No one wears glasses like that and for some reason that glitch really bothers me. Literally wrote the review just for that. Otherwise great
I do not like the new update because it completely changed my bitmoji and I would like for it to change it back or have the option to have the old ones again.
Well it is not giving me the update I hate this app
I wanna make a bitmoji but I want to have it have a face veil,since I wear niqab/face veil  there is hijab on it but not with face veil. Please add option to have an option for niqabis lol
I love the app but I would like to suggest the option of having a wheelchair as an accessory or something so my Bitmoji would be more like me
Bitmoji is great with all the new stuff they added but I was a little disappointed when there wasn’t new clothes to ware.
Do not like the new update. My bitmoji face changed and I want my old face back please.... having an identity crisis because bitmoji no longer looks like me :(((
i’m absolutely in love with the new update.. so much more range and freedom to customize your bitmoji to look like you.. and taking a picture is really accurate, it’s so cool!! great feature to add two tone hair which i have and hate having to choose one hair color or another and now i don’t!! great update!!
I do not like the new bitmoji avatars. They are too animated and fake looking!! I thought the purpose was to make them look somewhat realistic by picking all the features and face shapes and eye shapes but now they all look fake. Not impressed!!
The new beanies don’t even fit on my characters head! Why? Also please add ombré hairstyles. You have the opposite right now but no ombré.
I accidentally saved the new Bitmoji and hate it. Anyway to get the old one back?
I have curly hair right and tbh the curly hairstyles are too short. There was an update for longer but that's all straight hair. I think snapchat could add some fun long hair curly hair styles for people like me :) for now I'm stuck using the ponytail and it just doesn't look enough like me.
I use to love Bitmoji! I made all my friends make one. But I don’t like the most recent update. Please make the option of going back to the old style. PLEASE!!
i have braids in my hair 27/7. not strings, braids. can you please go back and define what is supposed to be the braids for each strand and not make it look like a mop. thank you.
How can I change mine back
Hi i like it in only writing this to request y’all put in mobility aids (wheelchair/cane/crutches/etc.)
I honestly REALLY hate the new bit moji update!! I miss the old one! I’ve seen my friends wearing the new bit moji update and I dislike is every much. Otherwise this is a very good app to design yourself and all. Just that problem, please bring it back!
Can you add bigger lips?! Not everyone has thin lips.
Love the update, but I didn’t receive the hair treatments with the update. I have treated hair, so I was very excited about it. Please make sure everyone gets the same update!
FIRST OFF I want to say thank you so so much to the Bitmoji developers for really taking the time to read our comments and take our input/complaints into consideration to make the app better! That really does make a ton of difference!  On to the review! I could not be happier with the newest update that just came out (2/7/18)  With all the new hair and skin colors, the hair styles, the ombré effects to allow two-toned hair, I’m SUPREMELY impressed and pleased.  Thanks to this newest update,  I won’t ever need to use any other avatar app anymore! I can put my avi in cool clothing, and thanks to the new hairstyles and colors, I can give her my signature purple hair (and any other color I experiment with!) no problem!!!  I was even able to accurately make my boyfriend (finally!! I could never do that before!) The only thing they need now is more body types to allow for bigger women to feel better represented!! And maybe allow the male avatars to have access to makeup too!!!  But I think they’ve done an excellent job with this recent patch and I know my friends and I are all super excited to use it for EVERYTHING😁 I can tell this is just the first step in all the future improvements! 
Please add body types for more of the thicc individuals 🙃 my stomach is not that big
I would like more cloths and why can we not have ombré hair?????? I have purple tips in my hair and I can't do that on here so it really doesn't look like me and therefore I have no use in the app
Finally!! The new update is perfect! It’s everything that I’ve been wanting/waiting for. The only problem is there is no new clothes! Please, please, please, give us new clothes! Also, it would be really cool if we got new clothes every couple months or so. Would love to see more clothes from the Forever 21 & Nike categories that we already have. Other than that, I love it!
Hi! I love love love the new update my avatar looks so much like me now! Just one thing left...please please add facial piercings next! I only have a nose piercing but I know a lot of people have more but I’d love for it to look more like me without it being my face! haha!
If I could add my mole it would be super official!! Dope app ! 😂
Tbh I really liked this app and the new update then I figured out that they changed the type of Bitmoji you have with a new one and you can’t get it on the regular bitmoji. If there is a way I’m sorry, but overall I really like this app!!               ~Bitmojigirl❤️ 
LET ME HAVE FRECKLES AND DIMPLES AT THE SAME TIME PLEAAAASEEE.
The old update is better
This is a great app but there should be an ability to make your own shirt where you can draw and import images. There should also be a way to make your own picture(words, fonts and poses). Thanks!
So is there a way you can give a BitMoji some waves for us wavy guys out here😂😂
Is there anyway you guys can make it so we can link our Bitmoji to any media we like? Cause I am in love with this this update and would want to us in other places besides Snapchat and texting. Like Instagram’s stories
Hai and greetings!!!! I am the cat lover and I done online views for apps that I love!!! And I got to say this is one of my favs!!!!! The animations are cute and they reach my style!!!! I just have some notes and suggestions for u today!!!! First of all, I would HIGHLY recommend more reliable this app!!!! All my friends have it and we love to text these adorable stickers!!!! Now, here are some recommendations....... so I'm skinny but still have some chest, I recommend more chest sizes. Also, I recommend why more clothes and outfits!!! I need one that fits my style everyday every time!!!!!!!!! But I can’t seem to find that! This is a huge one that can u plzzzzzzzzzzzzz take in!!! I suggest highlighting!!!!! My hair is not in a million years one color!!!!!!! So to make It more real, give us HIGHLIGHTS!!! Plz plz plZ!!!! For my final suggestion I would recommend this, as I was looking though reviews I was looking at one I would like to say, one girl suggested a game!!!! That would be awesome!!! And what I mean by this is u can have friends, have a house work somewhere, and hang!!!! I mean that would be amazing!!!!!! For some of u that r clueless this means make it more like animals jam/ roblox/ club penguin/ ect...... I hope u took these suggestions into count!!!!!!!! Thx for reading.                - the catlover 🐱🐱🐱  Ok so if u want more here u go....... I just came back from the new update and I love it!!!!!!!!!!!! Wellllllll maybe not that much...... first of all u didn’t add highlights to the bit strips style which idk about u but this is the only one me and my friends use. I appreciate that u made new body sizes but u need more clothes!!!!!!!!!!!! I would still recommend this but plz take my ideas!!!!!! Thx see ya later!!! 
I love this app especially now that it’s linked with Snapchat . I think with this new update they made great improvements like providing more realistic skin tones and tons more physical characteristic options. One feature I think would make this up Even better would be if the user would be allowed to individually put together outfits. This allows the user to express them selves more freely instead of having to chose from outfits already put together .
I don’t like the way the new version looks with the realistic looks. The older version was better and you should at least be able to pick between the two!!
Can you please add tattoos. I feel like adding tattoos to our bitmoji characters will make them more unique and look more like the person they represent. Thank You! ps i also feel like it would be awesome if we could design our own clothes!
Love the new deluxe bitmoji but please add nose ring!! mine just doesn’t feel right without it.
App keeps crashing. Considering almost every millennial male has some version of an undercut or fade with long hair on top it seems weird you only have 90s hairstyles for guys.   Also for the love of god get some licensed superhero costumes. Deadpool, arrow verse characters, maybe AMC characters- rick grimes/Walter white etc. guess Batman is gone? If not then your app isn’t working for me. 
Gave it a five because I love it but the one thing I’d say to change is to let us pick different clothes from different brands and categories to mix and match the perfect outfit. yknow?
So I was really happy when bitmoji deluxe came out so I went to update my bitmoji. However, I have curly hair with highlights. There is really only 4 types though! Straight, wavy, short, or afro. I don’t have either wavy hair or an afro but there is no style that’s in between! Also for each of the styles there should be an option where you can choose where your hair parts!
they should make an extension where you can create an avatar of your pet!
Dear Bitmoji developers, I freaking love my Bitmoji but I'm been waiting for forever for y'all to launch Bitmoji western apparel I'm sure I ain't the only one who would want to rock some boots! Can y'all make this happen please?!?!
Hello I’m just writing regards to the pose my bit mojo character makes when i change clothes on him. I find it offensive that the way my bit mojo character poses looks feminine and not a normal stand pose. I think u should add in the option to change the pose of your character and if u are in fact feminine in anyway then that should be the choice a person can make not have it to where I’m posed like I’m a gay man when I’m not. Over all it’s a great app and i appreciate if you guys  can give us a different option to pose when changing clothes it would be awesome thanks!
I’ve recently updated the app and tried to make changes my Bitmoji but I kept getting an error that said that saving failed and to try again later. I’ve been trying to edit my Bitmoji for a couple of hours now (on and off) and I still keep getting the same message.
The editor and basic functions of this app work fine, but it lost a star because it lacks a search bar, and another star because it’s missing the ability to add a birthmark (a basic function that’s existed in avatar editors like Nintendo’s Mii maker for years). The amount of outfits is also surprisingly low.
This isn’t working at all. I can’t edit my avatar or change outfits.
Every time I do the selfie to match my emoji, it doesn’t work.. needs to be fixed. After It gets fixed this app would literally be the best!
Loving the new update! Just wish they had more options for people with curly hair. I have curly hair that goes past my shoulders and the only options are slightly wavy or a full afro, and none of the curlier styles are long. Hopefully more styles will come with the next update!
I am looooving the new Bitmoji Deluxe update. My Bitmoji really looks like me and I love all of my friends’ new changes. The only thing I can think to suggest adding is more clothing choices or even better, customizable clothing. (A whole bunch of types of shoes, shirts, etc. w/ color selections and being able to combine them for a unique outfit)
As a long-time bitmoji user I love the new options, I finally found a hairstyle that fits me! 😆 Anyways, the art is lovely and feels more individual now. Thanks you guys, well done and props on the update.
I love this app the only thing I don’t like is that you have to create an Snapchat account to like show up studs
Hi I'm Pig's biggest fan. I love 🐷. I like this app but it has a lot of cuss  words. I dont like that stuff. Have a good day! Thanks for reading this review.😃
upset they took away the crown option please bring it back
I love the camera setting to match my face how cute we twin  but why is there only three lip options I need bigger lip options we all don’t have bird lips
Love bitmoji & the updates. BUT the deluxe bitmoji is lacking several facial feature shapes. Especially noses. I loved so much about it but switched back to the old style bitstrip because there wasn’t one single nose that looked like mine. Which totally changed the look of my bitmoji to where it didn’t even resemble me.
Wow I really like this app! You can make an avatar and customize it however you like (like in Wii lol)! It's not an app I'd go bananas over, but it's a pretty cool and cute app. I definitely recommend this app to anyone who doesn't have it!!
Omg i love the deluxe, I got my exact hair, its actually really creepy..... Heres some suggestions that I think would make this app perfect: -Facial piercings!  -Better hats because some of them don’t fit every hairstyle -individually customizable outfits, or at least be able to change the color of the shirt/pants/shoes/etc of each outfit -Able to add your pet as a bitmoji. I have an all black cat and that’s not available in the stickers.  Otherwise I love the new style and what it has to offer, keep it up :) 
Iss cool
Hate the update
So there’s a million new haircuts but the one I used to wear before does no longer exist why??? Now there’s no short hair with curls. You either have the extremely curly hair, the Afro or my curls hiding behind the ears. I wish she didn’t have the hair behind the ears. And there’s not like a normal ponytail :(. I was feeling better before now idk I feel like she doesn’t look like me. And there’s not a skin color for Latina women there’s the Indian looking color with a yellow shade but there’s nothing for latinas that are a bit brown like me but not to the extreme. Like a little cinnamon/tan color. That doesn’t exist. And also there’s only three sizes for lips, before there were more.
Hmmm I can’t seem to find an outfit for the Super Bowl Winner!!!
I love this app and how you can even use your bitmoji on snapchat and the new update with the bitmoji deluxe! I’ve just got one suggestion though, can you add a sweatshirt area in the clothes section? Cuz I love sweatshirts and that’s like all I wear lol.   Thank you 
I LOVE this app. Everything about it is perfect.   EXCEPT ONE THING:  Let us change the outfits individually. I like my outfit, but the shoes are not at all what I wear. I like some of the shoes from the other outfits. Not a biggy, just a convenience.   Thanks for the AWESOME app! 
I would like more outfit options but other than that it’s great 👍🏻👍🏻
I like the Bitmoji deluxe, but why would they get rid of mouth size?! My Bitmoji looks sooo weird with a huge mouth.
So i love this new update on the customizations and i think it’s really creative, although my bitmoji app lags sometimes.  request: You guys should really add more outfits for teenage girls, in stead of adult clothes, like maybe ripped jeans and long sleeved shirt or something? anyway y’all are doing great 
This app has been out for so long and they still can’t update it to be able to change the accessory colors like the hats. Just gray and burgundy. It needs more options!!!
Hey this is a really cool app, but there need to be more hair options. Especially for LONG, CURLY HAIR. I’m a white girl and I have very curly hair, but not like a black or mixed person. With the older version, I found a hair that worked fine enough, but this new update (where you take the selfie and everything) doesn’t have the same selection. The only kind of hair that comes close to looking the same is dreadlocks, and I don’t have dreadlocks.. My hair isn’t straight or wavy or super kinky, and I just think there should be an option between wavy and super kinky (that isn’t incredibly poofy).
Hey you guys should try to make some braces. It would totally make a stand out and a personality!!!
Y’all need durags on here bro.
i absolutely love the bitmoji app with all its new features! but what would love more is a little more clothing options for the guys and girls. other than this the app is amazing!
Can y’all add MLS jerseys
i think you guys need to add piercings of all kinds. and even body art!!! then everything would be perfect :)
The hairstyles for the deluxe have less than before! I don’t have curly short hair. Or super long frizzy curly hair! I can’t make an avatar with no wavy medium hair. I’m disappointed.
THIS IS AWESOME! But I see everywhere That there is the Hair Treatment part that I have wrote a review asking for and everyone has it but on my Bitmoji app I dont get the option! I only have buttons for hair style and color):
I really like this app but it needs more accessories like earrings bags rings it Also needs updated fashion like ugg Nike guess Ralph Lauren polo American eagle h&m Aeropostale shoes like Steve Madden Nike puma etc
I’m sorry but the new avatars are so ugly looking. Can we have an option to go back to the old look with the same hair/etc options? Also, please make more outfit options and make them cuter
This new version Snapchat is the worst I’ve ever seen
I have dread locks pretty short ones and it’s giving me girl hair and the long dreads that I don’t want and it’s keeps giving me a limit to my hairstyles.
👎🏻
If you change your Bitmoji & don’t like how it comes out, you can’t change it back. I’m very disappointed with this update
This is a nice little app to use, had no problems so far with it besides the lack of customization. Especially in the hair/facial hair category's. Need to add hair like box tops, afros, and some well known special design cuts.
I gave your app just 2 stars. It’s a great app for expressing oneself. But this morning I noticed for the first time a “celebrate black history”. Why? Why put out there an emoji for a particular race? Why isn’t there something specific for every race here then?
Love the new update! Now that we can diversify our looks better, now you all need to over haul the outfits! Make them more customizable or hell add more that aren’t sports or costumes! But id prefer them to be more customizable, like picking out the shoes pants and shirt instead of sets that you cannot change
The app is awesome but you guys should put new outfits like let us mix & match, accessories,  even shoes!
Almost perfect. I can now add my highlights, it’s a lot more accurate, and I really do love it. It has become more and more personable every update. I think the only thing left is earrings, and I can’t stress that enough. Peoples bitmojis almost look like them, but wait their missing the coveted “Katie’s diamond studs” or “Justin’s big gauges” and I personally think that adding earrings will be the next great improvement you will have made. Love Bitmoji!
I won’t be satisfied till you bring back my straw hat & the stubble for facial hair. Looks too cartoony.
GREAT JOB on the most recent update referring to the hairstyles (add a short hairstyle with some waves) and facial hair, nice! Heading in the right direction.... Reminds me of my old habbo hotel days. Dont stop there though! More clothes to choose from would be nice, allowing us to mix and match between different shirts, pants or shoes so everyone wouldn't look the same would be a plus. More accessories, alot of people wear earrings, diamonds studs, hoop earrings, etc... OVERALL good direction tho!
Love Bitmoji would love it more if you could add beauty marks/moles to make it look more like you !
Can you please update so my glasses are under my hair not on top 😂😂😂😂. Wardrobe malfunction 😩
I just had to go to change Bitmoji style to go to the new stuff again
I wish the new update had more hair and skin color options for colored like me
I love the app, great style and everything but FOR GOD’S SAKE! Please add curly hairstyles/hairtypes in the bitmoji style, PLEASE! ☹️
I think you guys should add a new hairstyle that isn’t there and some people have. I don’t know the name of it but I know it’s a low cut with a skin fade. I have a picture on what i mean but I can’t show it but you guys should consider adding a new hairstyle. But over everything else is amazing.
Hi whoever made bitmoji this game is amazing and I am so proud that you made it and you are AMAZING! Thank you for creating one of my favorite games! Your awesome!😀😃😄😁
Bitmoji should put college football teams outfits for people who like college football more than nfl
I like how you can take a selfie and create your Bitmoji to look more like your irl self. And I think that they should make it to where we can create our OWN outfit rather than having to use what they have. I only say this because I can’t find an outdoor that I like ALL of
DONT EVER GET RID OF THE NEW BITMOJI DELUXE! I LOVE IT😭👏👏🧐
I love the update—the picture matching on deluxe was very accurate!—however, you took my crown away & I want it back :(👑 not sure why deluxe & other styles can’t have the same accessories when they have the same outfits
I’ll start off saying that I love bitmoji. I’ve gotten so many other people to use them as well, they’re just cute & simple. And adorable to spice up your snaps with.  I just wish with all of the customizable updates there would be the ability to add tattoos and piercings, for those of us who’s bitmojis can’t look like us without tattoos.....  And maybe more clothing options, I’ve noticed that’s a common request. 
i’m triggered. it assumed my gender. u noobs deserve 1 star.
I’m infuriated!! I want the pizza segue back!!!
I love the new look, I really appreciate it. You guys rock 😍👌🏽
I love the most recent update but for people with tattoos and facial piercings it’s hard to make a bitmoji that truly looks like you. We don’t need more hats we need piercings and tattoos PLEASE!
This update is wonderful! The new afro hair is perfect. However the head size and face shapes need to be a bit expanded (smaller jawlines and head sizes). Also, more clothes would be great!
The new update is terrible. The bitmoji used to look exactly like me. And now they all look completely horrendous. I don’t know what, or why you guys changed it. But I think you should switch it back to how they used to look.
As many nice new things came I am very angry because I lost my Old Bitmoji that fit me perfectly they no longer have my hair style and I can’t get my old one back I am very dissapointed. 
I have a question if you can add earrings to your bitmoji? I’ve seen on google that people say you can but I was wondering if you can do it through the app??
The only hair options are either long and straight or kinky/coarse. I have long curly hair and there is no option for that?
Please add tattoos and let us be able to swap cloths not just a set look like use a Nike shirt with forever 21 pants I think that could be cool and could you add some under armor stuff. Thank you for reading this...
It’s really cool but I suggest and ask for more hair styles especially for girls with long curly hair and more clothing outfits something realistic with hoodies
I always have loved bitmoji bc she is so relatable, but now she looks like me! The customization controls are so much better than before and the only improvement that could make it even better would be more clothing options, off the shoulder tops, more van style shoes, destroyed jeans... she would be living her best life if she could wear an off the shoulder top with destroyed jeans. Anyway the update with the new customization options are so awesome. 10/10 but add more memes please, that would make me so happy.
I used to love my bitmoji being synced to my Snapchat. But since this latest update, it’s been messing up quite a bit. It’ll show my bitmoji with different hair styles and lip colors when I never updated mine to look that way. Very disappointed. Please fix the bugs
It’s cool and all but you guys need to add earings which I have some and I want to add them to my Bitmoji but there aren’t earings
I loveee the new update but can we pls get to choose are own outfits? Actually pick out jeans or a shirt shoes etc. I feel very restricted to picking an outfit out
The new fresh looks you have updated for 2018 was an awesome new change! Props to you guys for that, it’s been a long time coming 👏🏾. BUT... what needs to happen next is to be able to customize my bitmoji’s outfit, I don’t always like the preset outfits you guys have available. More customization would be freaking awesome!
I think waves and different type of fades should be added as well as hair designs in combination with the haircut.
The new updated version doesn’t look like me at all . The original before update definitely did.i suggest & I’m sure many others would agree bring back the original version. Horrible!!!!!!
I love the new bitmoji style so please if you could add the samurai hat from the bitmoji classic to the new one I miss my hat so much. 😭😭 Please I love this app makes every message much funnier and more expressive thank you
This is one of my absolute favorite apps but there should be way more options. A lot of people have braces like me but bitmoji doesn’t have an option for that. The only reason why my bitmoji doesn’t look like me is because of the teeth!!
Bruhh yall should put some hypebeast clothing outfits.
I already left a review about how I’d like to see more varying skin tones and I was so hopeful in this update with all of the new options, but I still have to leave one star off because I still can’t get that dang skin tone. Just leave it to us and let us have a color wheel/picker!! PLEASE!
The new update is good but I accidentally changed the hairstyle to something I don’t like and I wanted my previous hairstyle back but it’s not in this update, I guess you removed it when you added more... but please bring previous ones back
Wish there was a way to search in the app. It takes too long to find things which keeps people waiting when texting.
The new update is amazing! I love how there is so much variety and it’s so inclusive of so many skin tones, religious wear, hair color/style. Y’all really killed it. The only thing I hope you change is the lack of variety of hairstyles with bangs. There aren’t very many!
It would be soooo cute if you guys make some Mexican traditional dresses with the colors for the girls! And maybe some roses for the hair. I don’t know, something different and cute😍😍😍
I have seen a lot of hate about Snapchat’s newest update 10.24.1, and I myself am not liking it at all. Everything is squished together and unorganized I think it’s time to switch back.
while it’s nice that the bitmoji is more customizable they took out some good hairstyles, including the one i used for my own bitmoji. As soon as I opened the updated app it automatically changed my appearance and I’m not able to switch back to my old one. It’s also ironic that the icon for the hairstyle menu is the exact hairstyle I used to have, but it’s not actually available for us to use in our bitmoji. I also don’t think anything significant was added in this update.
You should add braces, wheelchairs, crutches, cast, eye patch (left and right), kind of car we driving, more clothes like favorite bands, favorite celebrity, or animals.
I loved the new bitmoji style, it’s adorable with a bunch of new options. I was creating my bitmoji and became wicked disappointed at the fact that there are still NO hazel eye options. I understand this can be difficult, because it is a mixed color of eye, but my bitmoji looks nothing like me because I am forced to use the brown eye color, when my eyes are not brown, but not light enough to use the green option
I honestly my love my bitmoji because it’s so cute and theres a bitmoji for everything! but could you add moles (beautymarks) so I can make it more like me?
Could y’all please bring the motorcycle helmet back for the new update? 🙏😭
While the service provided by the app is definitely recommendable as five star, I find it disappointing that with all the updating, there are no new clothes. Please change that, it would be appreciated by many.
Very nice app. I like the new avatars but would like some of the features to be included for the other styles of character. Also, would it be possible to add braces?
I don't have eyebrows so I wish they would let me take off the eyebrows on my bitmoji!!!! :(
The apps pretty cool, I like the new update, I wish there was an option to put braces on my bitmoji so it would look more like me but other than that the apps good.
I’ve had a Bitmoji since it was introduced as bitstrips. I remember you could do something like comic strips. I really enjoyed that. Is it possible to intergrade that in iMessages? I’m sure you are working on it. Thanks for what you all do. Also. Will there be a search tab in the native app? That would be helpful to copy and paste to other messaging apps 
I think you guys should make an edit to where we can add belly button piercings because so many girls have them nowadays including me.
I’m really enjoying the app so far! Just one suggestion. Do you think you’d be able to add an option of piercings? Ear, lip and nose maybe? Other than that, 5 star app!
I love love the new update, it has so much more things to make my bitmoji even better and to look like me even more. I love!! And it was a great idea to add the selfie so it can help with the features better! Good work guys!
The new update is great, but you guys haven’t added braces yet. I think braces would be a great thing to add, a lot of people have braces.
I am extremely displeased and disappointed in the fact that it allows curse words to be used, but when my very dear friend tried to search for a Bitmoji with the word “die” in it, no results showed up. I expected more from the brilliant creators of this app. The only reason I am giving this app a 1 star rating is because it doesn’t let me give 1/2 stars. Please fix it. Thank you for your time and consideration... it was appreciated.
I love it tbh i would like my bitmoji too be thicker I ain’t skinny. It ain’t a big deal but it would be pretty cool 🌸🌸🌸🌸 follow me @MalykkaMarks (Poppin Page) if you saw me here comment sup doeeee 🌹
Can you guys add gap tooth and braces!!???! Pleeeeease 😍😍😍 I’ll love u forever!!! I’m team Gap 😬 I’ll give 5 ⭐️
I love this app, and use it daily. The only thing is I would love to have the friendmoji feature present in iMessage as it is in snapchat, so we can feature the person we’re talking to as well.   Great app overall! 
People should get to make their own outfits, not just ones that are already set for them to pick from
The new update is amazing! They just need more variety for the clothes. Almost all of my friends are dressing their Bitmojis in the same two outfits!
I can’t figure out how I can ombré my hair on my bitmoji
I have always enjoyed the way Bitmoji works in snapchat allowing me to have my avatar with other people’s avatar. That is the most fun. But this new update allows me to have the avatar of my dreams! Thank you so much for the wide variety of skin, nose hair types and hair colors!!! It makes me so happy and I know it was a lot of work to develop it to this level but I am ever so grateful.
This is a amazing app if you connect it to Snapchat then it’s even better I suggest it to everyone but it is 12 and up so you can choose if you still want to get but you should
old update was better
The new bitmojis are trying to be too real and less of a cartoon. They’re a little creepy now.
You made all these changes and you didn’t even think to make new clothes Ps please stop making these ugly sport wear 
Why cant i make my character look cartoony like before
I love using this App but it would be nice to have more clothes selections please do this on the next update 👍🏼
Where are the earrings on the new update. The hair is amazing!!!
I love this app but, for some reason I don’t have the same features as my friends do. I’m disappointed.
Great app ! What happens to the recently sent favorites section? Since the new update , it’s not there ..  pain in butt having to look them up
How do I make my hair cornrows nutin poppin up
could you please let us change the pupil size like the old one.
its ugly. i accidentally deleted my bitmoji, i had the first type of avatars. now that im making one again, they are alllll ugly! please bring back the old ones
Add new outfit pls!! Love the app btw
Okay seriously guys ?  It was annoying enough that you didn’t have the same options for bitmoji vs bitstrip.  Now you’ve added a whole new third option? A deluxe version.  The deluxe version facial feature is really ugly. Why was it not easier to just add more variety options to the original bitmoji and bitstrip.
Hi, I love this app and have introduced it to friends and family and they like it too . My suggestion is having a search bar bc scrolling thru so many tryin to find appropriate one is time consuming and I find myself searching a lot hope you add that thx!
Needs more options for curly hair please fix soon. There are three curly hair options non of which look nice and describe what I look like.
The avatar creation from a picture doesn’t even work in the slightest. There is no change or feedback that it’s even processing it.
Hi I’m always the one on my bitmoji. The bitmojis always match my style. They are so cute and I’m so looking forward for the next update!!!!
So I have ombré hair and have watched all the videos on how to do it and it shows an option on ombré hair but it is not giving me that option!! Please help! What do I do?
I think braces should be an option for your bitmoji! And I think changing the colors would be cool too!!
I love the new update but it would be awesome if you could make your own outfit. Like there are all different styles but you can change the colors of them! Thanks for the update I hope you take my suggestion!
How about earring options ?
This is a very useful app to use for apps like snapchat, whatsapp, and messages. It is very fun to customize your own personal emoji just for you. I have a suggestion. Could there be an option for one dimple when customizing your bitmoji’s face? I have only one dimple on my face so it would be great if my bitmoji could have one aswell. Thank you!
If the person I’m texting has a Bitmoji, is it possible that both our Bitmojis show up as we text just like Snapchat? If it can happen on Snapchat, I’m pretty sure that feature can be made possible for iPhones & androids☺️
Can you make more gender related Bitmojis. And I know people get offended like don’t assume my gender crap. But seriously make both gender Bitmojis available to them. Like as a girl I’d like more relatable Bitmojis to my life or that time of the month. Thanks
I wish you could add more color to my dreads for my lil pump Bitmoji
the new style is great , however the lip sizes are off for alot of people, i think there should be an option to adjust lip width because there are some thin lips , but theyre wide ( not all thin lips are small ) some lips as full but arent necessarily wide ( theyre pouty ) , if you know what i mean
It would be a 5 but every time I download this and try to create a bitmoji it’s says the servers have failed to log me in! So know I can’t even make a bitmoji and I have an iPhone7
I love bitmoji and all the new features buuuuutttttttttt can we get a feature to change my forehead size lol it’s a small detail but it makes a difference
I’d give this 5 stars if I could find Bitmoji clothes that look like the stuff I actually wear. I always wear long skirts below my knees and there are none. The one my Bitmoji is wearing was the ONLY longer skirt and I can’t change my clothes because they’ve taken it off and if I do I can’t change it back. It gave me hideous black shoes, but I want to be barefoot because I’m always barefoot in real life. Just fix the clothing please! Everyone wants you to.  **I lowered my star rating even lower just now because they put a brand new avatar style and STILL did not put good clothing. It still has the same ugly stuff with no long skirts and no barefoot options. 
This app is great, it’s added hairstyles and a different bitmoji style, BUT I wish it would add piercings! I would love to be able to add piercings to it. Oh, and maybe a panda suit? That would be great. Anyway, this app is really good to have if you have snapchat or just want something with a little you that you can send to people.
I love this app because I love making characters but I hate how I can only make one plz add more PLEAAAS
you guys should add robes to the outfits.
I love this app and love the updates but it still needs more haircuts! There’s currently no wavy or straight bob length ones with a center part.  Caucasian hair thank you
I love using bitmoji however you can’t send your bitmoji together with the person you’re texting like they have in Snapchat. If you could add this I would be very grateful!
the new update is terrible the new bitmoji style is not cute not downloading again unless they bring the old ones back , after i worked so hard on my old bitmoji 🙄😡😡🤬
My selfie update thing won’t work :,,(
I love the new update!!!! The Ombre hair is amazing!!!! I still really want new outfits though 😫  Also the bitmoji stickers are no longer working in snapchat since last update 
I updated the app but I haven’t gotten all the new hairs, glasses, etc... I’ve tried deleting and reinstalling but that didn’t work either. Please help :(
I love using bitmoji!! Just wish that you could add  lots of earring selections for them.. I would love some really nice big sparkly earrings for my girl!
I just updated and started playing around with the new features but I can’t go back to what I had! My old hairstyle is gone! Be careful when messing around with the new update!
I want more pink clothes or any kind of new clothes
you need to add accessories for the men in the deluxe such watches and earrings etc etc
New update doesn’t look anything like me lol. The nose selection is horrible!!
Please bring back the old hairstyles, my Bitmoji looks so bad without the one I originally chose
The app overall is great it’s really fun to play around with on Snapchat lol but what I’ve noticed was that there isn’t any option of tattoos or piercings 😢 I have both of my sleeves done and stretched ears including an industrial piercing 😁 it would be amazing if they could implement the idea of adding things like this to the app like piercings and tattoos just so that the bitmoji itself can really show others what the digital version of you looks like 🤓
The new update downgraded the app taking away my favorite hat they should have an option for Felix or normal don’t recommend until I get my hat back
my app doesn't have the hair treatments like everyone else's for some reason and it makes me very upset
Y’all still don’t have my hairstyle (parted in the middle, wavy/lightly curly, buzzed on the side, and only goes about to my ears. Please add it 🙏🙏🙏
You must increase the existing clothing collection and develop a new style
The apps new update is amazing with all the new hairstyles and much more realistic looks but the outfits are still limited to a smaller choice. And instead of having preset outfits I wish there were customizable outfits to fit your own style that’s not within the preset outfits. Besides that the app is awesome!
I’ve never written an app review, but I’m really disappointed in the upgrade! I can’t seem to make my new avatar look remotely similar to me and my old one was uncanny. (People unfamiliar with bitmoji thought I had somehow commissioned my avatar bc she was spot on!) Bring back the old option too, please! Apparently I look more like a cartoon than the more “realistic” options you have and I’m so bummed to not have this fun app anymore!
I don’t feel like the new update is inclusive to mixed individuals. The whole point of it was to create a more realistic image of the actual user into a bitmoji. That’s the magic of bitmoji. Even the outdated version provided this for us. Graphics are A1 though, I highly appreciate it. New accessories such as the beret should be included. After all, it is the essence of many other bitmojis such as myself. I hope you take this into consideration. I’ll be waiting for another update. Thanks!
It would be great if y’all could add features like nose piercings!
The new deluxe update is amazing! It finally has everyone’s hair type and style :). My only concern is the lip options, I feel as if there should be a few more choices for all sizes lips since there isn’t my type.
Seriously, this was a step in the right direction, and I am loving it. However, we have to get some new stylish clothes to go with the new style. We need a new collection that has something for everyone.
PLEASE give us more clothing choices!! There are only a select few that fit my friends and I’s style so please either add more clothes or allow us to customize our outfits! Other then that I love this app!!
yeah i love it and also love the new style but what would be so cool is if we could customize the clothes more. pick a top and a bottom and shoes and pair them how we like
This app would be amazing if you added piercing options! I have a septum piercing and wish you had that as an option to make it look more real.
Love the new update, but need some more outfits (:
I love Bitmoji especially when it comes to using it on Snapchat. However, with the new “Deluxe” update... I wish the developers would give users the chance to choose which style of avatar they can use. Let me explain. As for me, I liked it when my avatar was the Bitstrip style. I was just messing around with my avatar and playing around with the looks because of the new update, but now I can’t go back to using my original Bitstrip style looking avatar. Now my Bitmoji looks nothing like me. I hope they can fix this!
Love all of the new additions for the avatars and use this app texting all the time. One thing I’d like to see in the future is the ability to add another friends bitmoji into the basic templates. So for example, there would be the option to have my and my fiancé’s bitmojis both in the sticker templates instead of just mine. Just something that would be cool, otherwise love the app and keep up the good work!
I love all the new features, like being able to makeup on a guy but I would love if u guys could make a mole option so I can put a mole on my face.  I have a mole on my check and I would like to put it on my bitmoji but I can’t. This would be a nice feature to add. 
So I love the new update but one thing I think would be cool is if you add facial piercings as an accessory♥️
good app, and i love the new features buuut bitmoji deluxe doesn’t have my hair (long curly hair that doesn’t look like a literal lions mane)
I love the amount of choices you can edit your character with I would like to see some piercings or some circle framed glasses (besides sunglasses) because those are some of my features But either way love the new update! 
Exactly what the description says......
It won’t let me look at the deluxe and I don’t know why. It wint even show the camera icon.
I love it, but I wish you had piercings, and I want the bitmoji keyboard, I just don’t trust the full access keyboard, it’s a little suspicious, but yeah other than those things the apps great!
Hello, I’m Sadie if you are reading this just know that this app is AMAZING!!!🤣🤣I use this app all the time!! Please if you are looking for a way to put some fun into your texts and add a little animations to your texts, GET THIS APP!  Good-Bye,  Sadie   😁 
This is such an amazing app and I highly recommend it, just wish there was more cloth choices I.e. purple tuxedo to match my top hat. Other then clothing app is very great and can really come in handy.
I love bitmoji it’s my favorite app of all the apps in the world!!!!! But I wish in the new update they can put abs for the body thank you
Hi wouldn’t it be cool if there was a petmoji I don’t think they creators see this but I would think it would be awesome to do a petmoji thing😊
I love bitmoji soooo much, and the new update makes it so much better!!! I would love more outfits to choose from
I love this app so much and with the new update we got so many new hair styles and colors including the option to make the bottom of your hair a different color or add highlights. Unfortunately the highlights are only for shorter hair styles but I have long hair with highlights so if you could please add highlights for long hair that would be great. Thanks and I love this amazing app
so like, I like bitmoji and everything, it’s cute and all but one thing that’s annoying me right now is how I haven’t gotten the bitmoji deluxe. it’s taking a while and just wanna know why.
Theres just a few things missing, (in my opinion) such as some of the headwear not useable in the new style such as the arrow through the head, and just a suggestion, add red and blue lensed 3d glasses and the frames are black
This app is AMAZING!!! The detailed features are much more lifelike. I love the variety in this app. I definitely recommend this app to everyone.
I understand a lot of teen use it but a lot of young adults Also use it! And adults, so I would love to see an option of being pregnant so I can wear all that same clothes but just pregnant. Instead of just like 5 options of maternity! I would loooovvveee that!
Omg I love bitmoji but I had to delete the app to get the newer one and now I don't know how to get Snapchat updated to my new bitmoji
I know about the new update but when I check and does the update it doesn’t work🤦🏽‍♀️ like AT ALL need help
Needs more options for people with curly hair...
The recent update with all the character customization is great! I love it! I just really wish we could customize our clothes though. Maybe for the next update? The preloaded clothes are alright, I just wish I could wear what I normally wear on it?
Love the app! Please add some new outfits! I’d love to see some stuff that fight everybody’s style. Or, a custom clothing/outfit designer/maker would be great. At least being able to mix and match some of the pants and shirts and change the colors. Thanks! 💕💕
i haven’t been able to use the “more advanced” things you offered such as hair treatments and new headbands. what’s happening?
I have recently downloaded the updated bitmoji app and it’s AMAZING, the different hair options are wonderful. But I have a problem on my app there is no “treatment” selection, please help me with this problem, thanks.~Elysa
I love the new update with the new avatars and hairstyles, but I think there should be more outfits that people wear on a daily basis and more outfits that are aesthetically pleasing (kind of like outfits instagram girls would wear?) but overall i love this!! :)
I am having trouble on finding out on how to die the ends on my Bitmojis hair but other than that I love the app it’s a lot more better way to express my feelings to others 😁👍🏻
One request: Please Please Please add luffy’s straw hat for Bitmojis!
The new update is horrible! I loved how it was before and I wish I could get it back! They don't even give you the Bitmoji style option😢 Don't update it!
It is a good app but it won’t give me any more updates and my friends all have the new update! And my iPod is not that old, I got it little over a year ago! So no don’t buy the app cause you may not get the update 😢🙁☹️
Yo y’all need to add some more clothes OR make it so we can mix an match shirts, pants and shoes
The new update is just awesome. The only thing I suggest is that the app have the option to give your bitmoji piercings! Once that is added I believe the app will be perfect!!!
I really like the app but I wish there were more personalisation with the outfits. I would like to have some collage football outfits.
I have an Apple phone and was wondering why all my friends had updated and more detailed avatars. I asked them and they said it’s in the new Bitmoji update, so I went to go change my avatar. I swiped the styles and I only have the old ones! I checked the App Store to make sure I had the latest update with Bitmoji Deluxe and I did. Why isn’t it showing up???
Hey! I absolutely love this app and the newly added Bitmoji Deluxe, but because of my chronic illnesses I have a feeding tube and a broviac catheter and use a wheelchair, and currently we have no options like that which I totally get. But I would love to have those types of medical equipment, like NG and G feeding tubes, PIC lines and Broviac Catheters, pacemakers, casts, braces (for body/teeth), wheelchairs, canes, and crutches, oxygen, hearing aids, tracheostomy tubes, and so much else. I know so many people just like me that would be blown away to see you broaden your horizons in the medical aspect of things. I hope you guys see this it would mean the world to me and so many others out there that love your app as much as I do ❤️❤️❤️
You need to add more clothing. I see some basic Nike and 3 adidas. You also have a big range of American football and hockey and such but no soccer. I suggest you add soccer teams like fc barcelona or Argentina international so people can be more happy with this app. Thanks.
the bitmojis are fugly first of all and honestly when are you gonna give us a gender neutral character options likeim tired
I love this app
I love this app and it’s very creative but I’m fully updated and mine isn’t doing the Bitmoji Deluxe thing and many of my friends have t but I don’t and I really would like if this issue was resolved
Honestly bitmoji is great!! I love the new update and features on it. Everything has changed except for the clothes. I think the clothes need more of an update because it’s the same clothing. I would suggest to let the user pic their own top and bottom and shoes to make their own outfits! I remember when bitmoji was bitstrip and it was possible to do that! But overall bitmoji is great I love the new update just please new clothing or clothing ideas!!!!
I only use it for Snapchat. I use bitmoji deluxe. I wish we could choose the pants and shirts separately. And I think jewelry should be an option if it’s own.  Other than that, it does what it’s supposed to. 🤔 
I don’t have the new update ? But I love this, I would rate it more but it says I have the new update but i don’t see it hELP ?
The app is awesome, I do have one issue with the new deluxe Avatar. I put an NFL outfit on my guy, and whenever the hat is on him, it gives him long hair, totally changes the hairstyle. I’ve tried to reset, but it continues to put long hair on any ball cap wearing Deluxe Bitmojis. Am I the only one this is happening to?
I really like the idea of this app, it’s amazing. But, I feel that you should make it so we can customize our own outfits. You can do this by making clothing packs, such as pants, shirts, shoes, and etc. I WOULD PAY MONEY FOR THIS. THANK YOU!!
So, sadly. I have updated the app to get the new bitmoji style, yet when I go to change the style the newest style doesn’t appear. I’m currently living with no WiFi- that might have something to do with it.     Overall, I love this app. I use my bitmoji a ton. Keep up the good work. 
Can you make it so Bitmojis can have acne?
I liked the cartoon avatars and so did all of my friends we prefer these ones much more so please add this in ur next update
Can you make the side of the glasses go under the hair like it should. And what happened to facial features ? Were they removed or am i just not able to find them
YOU ROCK. This new update actually gives options on hair and my avatar finally looks like me. Thanks so much for listening and responding so well 💜
As I said above enjoy using it with Snapchat quite often I wish we could mix-and-match all of our clothing options and make more customizable outfits
I wish Bitstrips continued with its original format where we could add our own text and dialogue bubbles. It’s feels too restricting to have to conform to “Pre-determined” text . I liked Bitstrips better than Bitmoji .
This app is so cool but you guys should add piercings
I LOVE the new update, but I miss the old headgear. You should really bring back the crazy hats like the fruit and pirate one! Please!!! I do really love the new update but wish there were more accessories (like hats)!
On foe nem grave shorty this app be bussin my avatar look just like me ♥️
they have a bunch of of different cute outfits, but why are the maternity ones all ugly?😒 pregnant women like to wear more than just leggings sometimes 🤷🏽‍♂️
I think this would be a great and super realistic addition to somehow incorporate into the app ❤️
Only thing they missing is braces & power chains
I am absolutely in love with Bitmoji. I remember in my beginning times of using Facebook, I loved posting Bitstrips to my friends and family. To see how much it has grown since being around 7-8 y.o, I am amazed! I couldn’t believe it when you guys came back around with the Classic ones! And now Deluxe!! Keep on creating new things for people to express themselves better! And please oh please keep the originals intact for whatever comes next. I love switching through all three of mine.
Eh
Hi there!  So I updated my Bitmoji app about a week ago  to 10.24 and when you open the app it still says it’s at 10.23... So I still haven’t gotten a chance to try out the Bitmoji deluxe yet. Any suggestions? 
I really love the new update and love the app in general. I am so thankful that there is more hair options and just more options for everything honestly, except body types. it seems really odd to me how the body types go from 4 different types of skinny then to obese. There should be a lot more body types in between.
So I’m probably stupid but i can’t find out how to use the deluxe style. I’ve been trying all day. ~Holly
Mine doesn’t work
This app is so cool when it was the super bowl #football it had the teams that where playing like they but your character in the clothing cool right 5stars
Why cant I update to the latest version??
bless you guys had like no long hair options and not very many shade options AND now I can finally have my green eyebrows!! All that’s missing is a pointy eyebrow option and my life would be COMPLETE. I never leave reviews but truly my life is complete now.
new one has very little options and looks weird
I thought the update was great for 2018 I love the hair treatment and all of the that but I thought that maybe you guys could add braces as an option. So please consider adding this but  otherwise the update is great. Thank you.
You can’t even make a hat look nice on a fake character games have been able to do this since the early 2000s and you can’t even manage to do it In 2018. No hats fit nicely on my long hair character which makes you people look like jokes at your jobs
Hi makers of the Bitmoji. I have a question for you. Do you think you can make braces for the next update you make? Some people that use this app might have braces. It would be really nice if you made braces in the mouth category for your next update.   Thanks 
I love Bitmoji but sometimes I can find what I want to say... I would appreciate it if you would have a wider selection of greetings! Tje one I want most is something that says "hello beautiful!"
I can tell the update has change people avatar but it hasn’t for me which is weird
The emoji’s are the greatest!!!  Wish that it had spell check though!
I’ve updated to the latest version but I still can only choose from bitstrips and bitmoji original. Help?
I just updated my Bitmoji app, and I was surprised with the improvement! Great job for adding variety. however I did notice that they were some things that were left out common features such as piercings, beauty marks, tattoos, jewelry, braces, and customizable outfits. I still enjoy using Bitmoji and I will continue to use it :)
We need at least nose rings. Tattoos would be amazing but please add nose rings
I really like bitmoji. The new update is great in terms of hair and accessories, but i really miss the old bitmoji faces! They used to look really cute but something feels off about them now. But still great job it’s just my own personal opinion :).
I saw that my friends have been using the new update, while everyone else is good, and it shows the “what’s new” I can’t update it. it doesn’t show where to update my app. help?
None of these updates showed up on my bitmoji. What the heck i want them
I would rate five but it is not working on my iphone7 by it I mean update is not showing up on another phone I used an samsungs7edge it works perfectly but the bitmoji deluxe is not working
The new deluxe bitmoji update is great! however, I think we need some more lip options back, along with a teeth option! I know a lot of people would appreciate it, including myself! (Braces, teeth gap, grills etc) otherwise great!
Hey Bitmoji Creators, I have a question.   I just recently updated my app after seeing the new Bitmoji Deluxe. Sad thing is, when I found out how to do that, the app wouldn’t let me.   I went into “Change Avatar Style,” and the Deluxe version of the avatar isn’t an option.   Please write me back, I need some help or suggestions. 
The new Bitmoji look is not that great. I am not able to make my Bitmoji look like me anymore. Very disappointed 😕...
I want to change the language of my bitmoji to Swedish! Instead of “happy birthday” I want it to say everything in Swedish... so, ”grattis på födelsedagen”   But it seems that I can’t do that 
Especially with the new update, this app is great! There’s a very large variety of choices for different features and it’s super cool. The pictures are fun to you when texting with your friends/family.
I can’t find earrings on the bitmoji deluxe and there have never been braces. I highly suggest you put braces as an option.
Don't really have any complaint really, the new update was great! My favorite update was the hairstyles and colors👌🏼Can't wait to see what new outfits you come out with in the future!
I love this app but I accidentally logged out and when I tried logging back in it says login error so I don’t like the log out feature
For the sports clothes I don’t like the hats and what they do with your hair (for long haired people) and I think you should be able to choose whatever hair accessories you want when you choose a sport outfit.
please please please add piercings!!
I love this app but i have a problem because i did the update yet it still shows me the old version please help !!
I love this app and use it constantly, but the only thing I’m wishing it had was some Hollister or Aeropostale. There’s Forever 21 and I like that, but it’s mostly dresses, and I don’t usually wear dresses. Otherwise I give this app 5 stars.
Bitmoji Deluxe doesn’t work for me and I don’t know why. I’ve updated everything.
Handicapped people need options too! No legs! And bring the girls hair poof back!
Would love if all the clothes were available regardless of gender. It would make more sense considering the hairstyles are available regardless of gender.
It won’t let me update to the new stuff
I hate this new update they make my Bitmoji look like if it’s 97 years old
The ear rings, freckles, afro, and better face structures. Perhaps more fuller lips for the top and bottom.
I love this app because the meams are funny and the graphics are good  🤩🤪😜
fun to create a mini version of yourself, just a few suggestions to make it even more personalized.  -have a color wheel for skin/hair/eye color so it’s 100% customizable -more hair treatment options like highlights not just ombré  -the ability to choose individual shirts, pants, etc. instead of full outfits. i like the new update these are just ways to make the next one even better! 
This is an amazing app! I love how you can someone look exactly like yourself... But yet the decency on here is very lacking... If I could request ONE thing, could it be that you could have skirts and/or dresses BELOW the knee? If you do that, THEN I could give my 5 stars ✨
I LOVE the new 3D styles. It looks really bright and new! One thing that i would love to see happen is if there were more accessories and such. Like piercings, etc. other thank that i think it’s amazing and keep doing a good job!
I really like this app it is cool cause it links to Snapchat it’s useful I haven’t had a single problem with Bitmoji
I love the new update with the new haistyles, skin tones, etc. Butttt I have a complaint I’m a female but I don’t wear really feminine clothes but if I have a male bitmoji it just doesn’t look right. So basically what I’m sayin is that can you please make the female bitmoji also have more masculine clothes and also not so basic clothes? Thanks🤗
i downloaded this because a lot of my friends had a bitmoji and i got sick of being a ghost on Snapchat. when i soon saw there was a Bitmoji Deluxe style i immediately fell in love with it and wanted to make my character with that design. So i opened Bitmoji and tried to edit my avatar; no deluxe option. i even RESET my avatar, and still no deluxe. i dont know how to get the deluxe option to work and it’s really starting to tick me off. help???
More hairstyles , shoes & outfits .
I love how much more realistic these can be now! I just was wondering if you could add tooth gap options in a future update? My teeth aren’t exactly all connected so I guess it’s not realistic in that sense. But everything is great otherwise!
We should have more face features such as beauty marks, freckles, etc. but other than that the app is really awesome!!
Looks strange please fix
This is what I noticed, the new update is only for ALL phones except for IPhones but we need more outfits because the old ones are boring PLEAS FIX THE NEW GODDAMN UPDATE
I loveeeeeeee Bitmoji I use it all the time while messaging my friends. When I discovered the new update I was very excited. Then I realized I needed Snapchat. I became very confused because that I not fair to all the other people who want the Deluxe version and don’t have Snapchat. I am not able to have Snapchat. I relied on Bitmoji to finally customize a person that looks exactly like me. But without Snapchat my needs aren’t fulfilled. I REALLY WANT THE DELUXE. I hope you read this a make that happen for me. Thanks!
I absolutely LOVE the Bitmoji Deluxe style. I can finally have hairstyles that match mine. There is however, much work that needs to be done. There should be more braided/cornrow type hairstyles, and MUCH more hats. But so far, I LOVE IT!
I love this app and I have one suggestion can u make it so u can create ur own outfit plz
I loveeeee the new up date ! But can we get some earrings?
Thank you for updating the art style and looks wonderful. One extra thing you could add is an option to make more people, instead of just one! 😜
The update is a little weird. It makes me look like a drug addict and I’m not. I liked it before the update but I still like it. The new hairstyles are nice and the hats. Overall the update is nice I just want my old bitemoji back. Thanks
I really like this version of Bitmoji! I use it way more often now because of its new character design. I like the new options. I find that my Bitmoji is more accurate with this update. Now I just wish I could customize the outfits a little more. Sometimes I like an outfit but I won’t like the shoes or accessories that go with it. A little more outfit customization for the next update, please!
When I first got Bitmoji, I was in love with it except that it didn't have any options for highlights. Hearing about this new development in the update, I got very excited. However when I updated I saw everything BUT the hair treatments. I restarted the app store, the app itself, and even my phone, and I still don't see it. Other than that I absolutely love this new update, and I'm very happy with the rest of it
I love the new update with the Bitmoji deluxe however,, add accessories! At least earrings!
Please let us customize the mouths more. Being able to move the placement of it and resize it a bit more would be nice. Thanks
I love this app. But we need more clothes and body shapes especially between the slender one to the chubby one. Besides that NO COMPLAINTS from me.
Actually no. I love the app and I love being able to use it in snapchat and text messages. However, ever since the new update, when I use the bitmoji animations in snapchat, my hairstyle changes from long and flowy to short and choppy. I don't know why because if I just use the stickers, my bitmoji has the correct hair (it's also right with my bitmoji selfie). What's up?
PLEASE ADD PIERCINGS AND TATTOOS ❤️
the update is great except they’re no options for our bitmojis head shape! pls give us and update
I dislike the new update; change them back to the old style
All the new update needs is more mouth options- 3 is not enough. And needs more clothing options
The new update changed my Bitmoji and none of the features previously available are the same. I can’t get my old Bitmoji back. Super lame.
Recently I cannot see hats on my bitmoji in the outfit selection screen. Help.
I am a female, & have very many options on bitmoji. While making my character, i even found a nose that i thought would look good on my boyfriend’s bitmoji. After finishing mine, we went to make his & were extremely disappointed because there was almost nothing at all to change. The nose i wanted to use for him wasted even an option. Now you guys are choosing what noses we can have based on our gender? GIVE THE MEN MORE OPTIONS or at least the amount women get!!
Love the new update my only concern is needs jewelry like earrings please.
omg get the old ones back i accidentally deleted mine and cant get it back😭
Hate the new update. My old bitmoji was cute now she just looks depressed and ugly. A little too much detail doesn’t make it better.
Love how amazing my avatar looks now, only complaint is there are no headphones for headgear anymore. Soon as that comes back it’s 5 starts
My bitmoji looks exactly like me just need to put a mullet hair cut on there so it can please and thank you
I absolutely love this app! Me and almost all my friends use it to create ourselves and just mess around. It lightens up the mood and is just fabulous.      I have a suggestion though.. Maybe more clothes would be nice. Perhaps a pajama section? 🙂 Including matching sets like when they occasionally change the outfit for the evening stickers? Even a large t shirt and pajama shirts would be nice. I just occasionally have those moments where I feel like a comfortable outfit would be nice to wear in the stickers. I do hope you respond! I love this app! 
Where my deluxe at fool? 😤
Bitmoji Deluxe isn’t on my phone. How do I get it there?
I don’t like the new update. Can you make it to were we have the old choices as well as the new
I KNOW YOU JUST GOT RID OF IT BUT PLEASEEEE BRING BACK THAT ONE HAIR I MISS IT AND ALSO PLEASE MAKE HAIRS THAT LOOK NORMAL ON SNAPCHAT MAPS 😭
The animated strips in Snapchat aren’t working after this week’s update.  I even tried to recreate delete and reinstall both apps and recreate my bitmoji.  I hope you get it fixed soon. Those are my favorite!
??
I like the app but the bitmoji deluxe option isn’t showing up for me when I go to “change avatar style”
Do not use the new Bitmoji deluxe, if u try to see how it looks like that and u change your mind u will be stuck with it.
I love this app but like come on now it’s 2018 and y’all still can’t make new outfits for our Bitmoji’s...
I don’t like the new Bitmoji. I can’t get my avatar to look right. My old was me exactly. There is no true Afro. Everyone I know dislike the changes.
I really the new style and all the options, but with Bitmoji deluxe, it looks like people with glasses have no eyebrows unless they’re raised
Love it, especially the new update!!!🙌🏼💖
As of 2/3/18 I am seriously impressed with the update, the face scanner got almost everything correct right away. The new attention to detail is AMAZING & can we talk about the new inclusivity???? The diversity in skin tone & the selection of religious headware is so much better than before. & the new hair colors and styles?? Golden. A++. I’m having so much fun with the color selections and combinations. I so appreciate everything in the new update especially the cuter bun,, now the only thing is customizable clothing instead of being forced to choose from pre-made outfits🤔🤔
The new update is fantastic! But I’ve been waiting for an update where we can add smaller characteristics to our faces like birth marks or moles. Otherwise, great!
I updated the app and it doesn’t work. I have the same hair styles. WHYYYY???
I love this app but it really needs an option to move facial features. The Bitmoji deluxe version needs more mouth options as well.
I love how I got my Bitmoji to look like me in the newest update! I wish there was more sports attire, maybe English Premier League or MLS, or more activewear.
I updated my app and the new Deluxe style of 2018 is not showing can anyone help?
Would receive a full five stars, if I could put my branch of service as my bitmoji. I know that there are army and marine corps outfits, but where’s the Navy uniform? Or Air Force(although we all rag on ‘Em. But in the end we’re all brothers and sisters)? Should add those on there for future updates.
So the deluxe update was MUCH NEEDED holy heck they do nicer now  Only suggestion is that they need update clothes, and there need to be options for piercings, braces, and more freckles. I have braces and freckles so having a bitmoji that doesn’t look like me makes me v sad 
we need piercings and tattoos! especially nose piercings!!
I love the update and all but three things I’m asking is that can you put waves on the hairstyles (African American short haired waves) and please make the tape line straight with a temp fade (just ask a African American barber he will know what you mean) and thanks again.
I love the new update because it gives so many more options to edit your bitmoji, But I do not like that there isn’t good options for having a ponytail. Love the app otherwise! 
This app is wonderful and quirky and fun to have especially on Snapchat however everyone looks the same I want uniqueness and originality but there’s are limited hair and clothing items available for selection we need more nice and Jordan clothes and the colors should match or let’s ya mix and match the outfits then it’ll be 5 out of 5stars i just wanna change shoes
They read your keyboard and everything you’ve ever used it for including your credit and banking information.
Soo, im trying to use the new bitmoji delixe feature and it is not showing anywhere on my bitmoji app. Im very confused and i dont know what else to do at this point.
I’m not doing a complaint or nothing bad it’s just that how do you do the new update character thing because I’m having trouble with it??? Please help me creator!!!!
This app is amazing and is fun to use!!! And now with Bitmoji Deluxe, my Bitmoji looks more like me than ever! IM IN LOVE
Totally love bitmoji but can you add more hair colors??
I updated my Bitmoji app along with snpachat and while everyone else I know is able to use the new settings it didnt work for me. There are still the same options, nothing is different. I cant use the ombre or take a picture of myself to get a closer portrayal. Why? 
it’s a good app an all but all my friends got the new update and when i go to the app i can’t get none of the new hairstyles or accessories
I’m very happy with the new hair colors and treatments, I just don’t get why you removed my hair style... and I will be happier when you add hair highlights!
I RLLY LOVE THIS NEW UPDATE BUT YOU GUYS NEED NEW CLOTHES
I highly recommend Bitmoji because of its new realistic style. I recently just updated the app and received “Bitmoji Deluxe.” Let me tell you all the details. You now get to add highlights to your hair and I read that they include over 100+ hairstyles. Your clothes stay the same! They always come up with NEW cute stickers almost every single day, featuring some emojis.   You get to link this app to various types of chatting apps, such as, Messages, Snapchat, Instagram, etc. If you link Bitmoji to Snapchat you get Friendmoji which features your friends in your stickers. Many cute stickers and all of them feature YOU in the spotlight! I give this app 5 stars because this is all FREE! No lie!   Although, I would like to make just one suggestion, they should add a new clothing line so we have more outfits to express our Bitmoji.   Thank you for reading this review, hope this helps you out! I highly recommend Bitmoji, so hope this guides you! 
where are the hairstyles for girls w long wavy/curly hair :( i tried updating my bitmoji to look more like me and it looks less like me than before and i can't even go back to what it used to look like. Being hispanic i like the new diverse skin colors that's about it
I love this Bitmoji of myself but they had a recent update and it hasn’t come to my phone yet and it’s troubling me
my character looks so pretty for a change and actually looks a lot like me thanks to added hairstyles. the glasses and ombré hair options are so cute too. my only suggestions are that hats don’t quite fit my character’s head (they look a bit off) and i wish we could mix and match outfits, you could keep the current outfits as “ready made” ones but allow full customization with plain shirts and different kinds of jeans and shoes too. i’ve seen a lot of people say they wish their bitmoji could match what they’re wearing that day and i think it would be such a cute idea.
Bitmoji deluxe isn’t a option for me
This NEEDS clout goggles for eyewear and I am very disappointed that they weren’t there in the first place
I LOVE this app, but for some reason my keyboard is messing up. It won’t let me go back to the “normal” Apple keyboard. I had to remove Bitmoji from my keyboard ☹️ Please fix the bugs!! Everything else is great! Thanks!
There aren’t waves on this app on BD.
Love this app and have loads of fun with it but PLEASE, PLEASE add a search bar!!!
I only updated to get the new multicultural bitmoji deluxe so that my bitmoji could actually look like me. Very disappointed that it did not show up at all and I am stuck with the same old white washed bitmoji 😒🙄
This app is fun! I use bitmojis quite a bit. I loved the new update with the added hair styles and new avatar theme.   Unfortunately, after an update with added hairstyles and about 30 different choices of nose, I can't help but notice the amount of body types has stayed the same. There are four varying degrees of skinny and a bowling ball. As a plus sized woman, I happen to know that those body types don't match a lot of larger women. With how many options there are for other settings I'm surprised there are so few options for body type, consider how many variances there are in real life. Small variances that have been consider in other settings.   I do hope your artists find the time to be more inclusive with body types. 
I updated the bitmoji app today hoping to make a bitmoji that really looked like me. i started to create it and i was at the end when i realized my bitmoji did not have breasts. i have breasts and wanted that represented. so i reset my bitmoji and started down the female path. for some reason the male and female options are COMPLETELY different. i was totally unable to create a bitmoji that looked like me in the female options. the eyeshapes were all wrong, i could not find a jawline that worked, i could not decide the size or spacing of the eyes on my own. in the male settings i couldnt change lip color or the shape of lips there were only three settings. the freckles and eye lines are completely different for eagh one and if you're male apparently you cannot have eyelashes and if you're female you HAVE to have eyelashes. i also do not like the fact that there are only three breast options. there are different sizes and shapes for breasts and the lack of representation is frustrating. in the headgear section there was one hijab choice in the female settings and like five in the male???? i do not understand this intense discrepancy. i would like to have all the choices male and female because some of the features fit me in one over the other for both settings. i would like more breasts options and for the face options to be consistent on both male and female settings. personnally i think there should not be male and female settings and you add breasts if you want them abd you dont add breasts if you dont want them. i would also like more cheek options. i have full cheeks and a light feminine jawline and i was unable to create that in either setting. it was pleasinng to see all the natural hair options and darker skin options however i still noticed more light skin options than dark skin options and more straight hair options than natural hair options. i also noticed you could not add accessories to braids which i feel is a very common hairstyle and should be an option. overall i am extremely dissappointed in this update. initially i was excited but as i explored more into the apps iptions i became increasingly irritated and frustrated at the double standards, sexism, racism and religious discrimination consistently showing up. i have used a bitmoji for years however after this update i am not certain i will continue to be using it.
I love the app, but I have what appears to be the most recent update up Bitmoji and I don’t have any of the supposedly new options?? What am I doing wrong?
We need more teeth options . So far I love my Bitmoji . But one of the main things people recognize me for my Bitmoji doesn't have 😐. *Update* Should’ve Added Natural Hair To Bitstrips. I Don’t Wanna Look Like Everybody Else.
Regardless of the gender, we would love for our hair tips to be a different color. My guy has dreads and I have dreads in my life but my hair is pitch black and the tips are brown while in the app, I have to choose one color. Other than that, it's great
But it would be even better if you add the choice of braces or different colored grills definitely gold for your teeth😁
❤️
I’m so happy about the inclusivity of ethnic hair and including other religious choices
I love bitmoji but I cannot experience the update because it says network error:(🙁😭
Ty bitmoji for updating it like this, I love it been waiting for this update 🤗
I don’t like using the keyboard I like using the stickers and they are awesome!!!! I hope to see some animations soon
Please make a stranger things theme
all my friends got the older version and it look better, this looks weird and I like the old look better smh
I love bitmoji and I got super excited when I saw all the new options to customize my avatar. Unfortunately, when I updated the app I didn’t have the bitmoji deluxe option. How do I get there, because i really want to customize my avatar.
Why don’t you offer ombré and balayage for bit-strip style?
I love/hate the new update. For one, I'm a Latina with spiral curly hair and forehead bangs...there's not one curly style that looks like mine! Either the hair is super puffy or dead wavy, with bangs pulled back or to the side. And the only curly style even remotely close, is super short and has no hair treatment options...really? Even the crew cuts have treatment options! I still feel like there aren't enough features and now my avatar looks even less like me. ☹️ Please add more variety to the hairstyles, including lengths, fullness and bang options! I'd also love to see more jewelry options, especially earrings! As for the wardrobe? It needs a major overhaul - I'm tired of seeing the same ones!
You need to add more styles for curly haired white women, also you need to add an option for two different colored eyes. Bc I have two different colored eyes.   Thanks. 
i love how realistic the new bitmogi features are.. my bitmogi looks more like me than ever before !! however, i would love for my bitmogi to finally have some EARRINGS!! i’ve has my ears pierced since the first month of my life and always had earrings in since.. my diamond studs have become a part of my entire look, but my bitmogi is earring-less and if it did have earrings we would practically be twins 😍 PLEASE bring earrings to bitmogis 💘
I love creating my Bitmoji but I just wish there was more options for body shapes. Like some people are thin but some people are thick too. I just wish there was more options.
Will you add like 2 thicker sizes below the largest one you have. I’m not as thin as the second to largest but I’m also not as large as the biggest one.
PLEASE have more options for mouth shape/ size. You have all these different eyes and noses but everyone’s mouth is the same? That’s a very important facial feature.
I love bitmoji so much, i just can’t seem to find a good hairstyle for curly heads. other than that i love this so much.
No like everyone is updating their Bitmojis and I don’t even have an opinion to update???
I love the new update. However, I’d like to request for ear piercings and possibly more outfits coming soon?
The hairs are great! I found a hairstyle that matches to my one in REAL LIFE.  Can you guys add a game were you can have your own room, talk to people and stuff? 
The possibilities are endless. I love this app and all the diverse options available to make my avatar close to my own image. I do wish that there more “tomboyish” outfit options for female avatars and more outfits in general but overall, excellent idea. Can’t wait to see more options.
This is the best app great work
I wanted ombré hair so I updated the app you know but there was nothing
My sisters are use the newest update and i can’t use Bitmoji deluxe why ??
Hi! Love your app... not loving the new update to the characters. Any way to revert back to an older one
I really wished that we could choose are own clothes. Like chose what top we want and want bottoms and shoes instead of be forced to choose a outfit. I wish we could make our own outfits and put them together. I please hoe them comes to the next update. ❤️❤️❤️
I like the new hair styles but the faces are SOO ugly I wanna change it back to my old one
I’m so glad Bitmoji Deluxe happened! It’s become so much easier to make your own avatar with all these new customization choices! My only issue would be the limited lip section. Possibly add larger lips and different shapes? But besides that this update is a great change!
So, I updated hoping for the new features like ombre hair and new styles, but so far it's been looking the same??? I've seen other bitmojis with flower crowns and all but I don't have that option when I try to customize.
Love Bitmojis. Brings a fun way to express oneself in a text, etc. But you should add more stuff like beauty marks for people (like myself) who have them.
Love Bitmoji, but need more options for clothes
Update didn’t fully work because everyone seems to have more from the latest update but me. I’ve made sure it up to date and still didn’t work.
i recently got the new update. can you change the bitstrips style to how it was orginally? thanks.
I love Bitmoji but I am a boy who wears eyeshadow, eyeliner, etc &’ im known for that so I don’t get why only girls have the makeup feature . my bitmoji doesn’t really feel like me with out it .. It’s 2018 boys wear makeup too .
I can’t figure out how exactly how do get the ombré look and highlights in the hair!! HELP!
This new update is pretty cool. The only thing I would recommend is another  haircut for men but with waves!
I feel like there should be teeth options like regular teeth and teeth with braces instead of just lips i like the lips but you need to create something that the guys and the girls will love instead of just the girls. I also feel like there should be a create your own clothing option so you can Mitch and match the shirts , shoes and the pants etc instead of having one boring option. (But other than that i love the app!)
BITMOJI SHOULD ADD A HIGH DIFFERENCE. THAT WOULD MAKE THIS APP SO MUCH BETTER AND CUTER
The Bitmoji app has not updated for me. I still have not received the Bitmoji Deluxe update. I’d really appreciate it if someone can tell me why.
My phone updated the Bitmoji app and i HATE the new face, it’s horrible , can you please put an option to change it back to how it was i really loved the last version but i hate this one .
Okay so, I love my bitmoji. However, I have purple hair there is no purple hair option I feel discriminated against. I believe there should be a purple hair option for all my fellow purple hair people out there.
I haven’t updated bitmoji manually in a long time, but my phone usually automatically updates some apps. So i was scrolling through snapchat and saw everyone was talking about he great new update, so I decided to “update it” myself. I don’t even get an option for the update. So i’m thinking, “alright, maybe it did it by itself”, but when i go to the app there’s no update.
Lots of new updates, but still no way to reflect a pregnancy bump besides a handful of spring/summer outfits. :(
I love the styles and the emojis
Says that I can pick new hairstyles, but there are no new items? The update hasn’t actually done anything to the app. I’m very confused.
This is a really great app to use! One of my favorite parts that I'm so glad they added is being able to change clothes! I definitely recommend this app.
Can’t change to Bitmoji deluxe idk why and I have updated the app!!!
I absolutely love Bitmoji it is an amazing way to express my emotions but there is a saxophone but I don’t play saxophone I play clarinet I think you should add a clarinet Bitmoji
It’s good but I wish you can customize your outfit better.  I wish you can pair up your own outfits. So you can pick which shirt you want with whatever pants and shoes you want
I’m loving the bitmoji updates, however I feel that it needs more of them. There aren’t enough body types provided to users, as not everyone is built stick straight and not everyone has skinny arms and legs and a giant stomach. There also needs to be more variety with regard to hairstyles and makeup. I would also like to see more clothing for girls that is current with today’s trends. I definitely feel that making these changes would make more users happy and make the bitmojis more realistic. Hopefully some of my suggestions will appear in the next update!
AMAZING. Take a selfie and it prompts the face change for you. So it sees your face and gives you a face on your bitmoji that you can tweak to your likings. New hairstyles and colors. I LOVE it. I’m so excited and pleased with this update. WOW
Pretty please include more ethnic hairstyles!!! Locs, twists, braids, etc..
Love Bitmoji Deluxe! Great job!
Love this app wish the maternity ones had more clothing options. Other then that it’s a cool app!!!
Love this app, have been using it for over a year now & I continue to have friends join in on the fun lol... Lularoe is the new trend, so this is a must🙌🏽 now I just had a friend start using bitmoji just now & I love how her has all the diff color hair on the ends, but my app doesn’t look like this😱😞 so I’m a little bummed about that, I always keep all my apps up to date so not sure why mine shows the old version🤷🏽‍♀️
:)
I love the new update! But I feel left out without my nose ring! How possible is it to update with the ability to have a black hoop nose ring?! 😛
Ok Bitmoji, I truly love you I really do. You seriously make communicating more fun. However, you recently added the avatars in monkey heads for the hear, see, and do no evil. I’m giving you the benefit of doubt and believe it’s just a coincidence these popped up during black history month. I’m also going to believe ignorance drove this appearance of insensitivity regardless of the month of the year. This stood out to me because I love monkeys but due to my ancestors and their struggle I will never ever wear a monkey suit.   Is it possible to have the avatar separate from the monkey. Consider having the avatar looking forward  and/or pointing at the monkey displaying such attitude.   Yes I know continuing to use this app is a choice that I’ve enjoyed up to this point. However, I also believe feedback is a gift and am choosing to share my perspective before I choose to no longer use it and also share with others this perspective while also reporting it to Apple. Please consider this adjustment to prevent future action. I’d prefer to keep using it but my integrity is never up of negotiation.   Also for those who think this is a politically correct moment let me also address them too. Truth and reconciliation only occurs when we truthfully acknowledge the history of the United States just as Germany acknowledged theirs. By doing so reconciliation can occur because specific prevention steps are in place. 
PLEASE
So bitmoji is amaze and all but you should put the option for braces please and thank you. Bye!
I updated the app, i reset my own bit. Yet NOTHING happened!! Nothing changed at all and all my friends have but mines the only one! Please Help! ~kaylee 
Love the update but I’m trynna dye the tips of my hair and I can’t because I’m black and the black hairstyles can’t dye it maybe next time
Its great but when I saw the update for Bitmoji a couple days ago, I obviously tried to update. I waited until it finished updating and went in. I went to settings, and I clicked on the avatar style button or whatever its called. Bitmoji Deluxe wasn’t there. I closed and opened the app again and it still wasn’t there. When I went to see if I needed to update it again, my phone told me it had already updated. Please please please fix this!!!
Thank you for making Bitmoji! It makes texting so much more fun to send a cartoon of myself!
I love the new update. Totally awesome and the best !!!! BUT.... can we revamp the clothes, I’m tired of the same clothes. Can we have a closet that we can select what top, bottom, shoes, jewelry, etc. ? It would take this app over the top for sure
Bitmoji is really really fun, but I wish there were more hair options for length. The longest it goes is to the shoulders, it’d be nice if they could add in some that’s to the waist.
Wow!!!!I am amazed how far this app have became since their newest and latest update.they’ve got so many new items added.My Niece,My Cousin,My Daughter And I absolutely love it!You’ve guys have really out done yourself.now If Only Their we’re more Bitmoji Family Options. I noticed there is a Bitmoji that says I Love you mother And I love you dad.May I suggest More Family I love you Options for Daughter,son,Cousin,Niece ,Nephew,sister,Brother,Husband/Wife,Boyfriend/Girlfriend.Also I would Like More Family greet Options Such as Hello/Hey Daughter/and Son.Hello Cousin,Hello Niece/And Nephew,Hello Sister/And Brother.And Hello Husband/Wifey.If these Options we’re added My family members can really benefit from these.I also Would Like More Mouth Options.There is only 3 Options for Lip size.so I like to suggest More fuller Lips such as I have.And Perhaps some Body Piercings and Tattoos would be great.Like for instance I would Love to see my Bitmoji with Labret Piercing and Also Lip Piercing Also. Hopefully Someone will be so kind to carefully read my suggestion :) Thank you guys so much 
I think that it’ll be cool if you guys could add Hollister, Abercrombie And Fitch, also add a feature where we can customize our own shoes too. That will be cool.
I absolutely love this app but I’m not allowed to update to the new update the Bitmoji deluxe, plz fix this , I have an iPhone 5 and every time I go to “ support “ on the app it tells me what to do , I do it but the update doesn’t show up .      :( 
😊
I have an iPhone 6s plus and still don't have the Deluxe feature
Can we get some bitmoji piercings & tattoos?? That would put the cherry on top👌🏽
Everyone who has a bitmoji gets the option of headwear and I’m the only one who doesn’t I find it unfair that I can’t have the same options as they do
hey! bitmoji’s are my life, I currently have my lock screen as my bitmoji deluxe moji 😂 but my friend brought a good idea and said that we should be able to make our own clothes!!! So I’m writing this review 🙃 amazing update thoe! I love it
I’m obsessed with BitMoji! I just wish there were more outfits available. Especially for maternity. Also, maybe more person details, like tattoos/piercings.
First of all, I loooooove the new update!!!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽  love the new hairstyles, hair colors, hair accessories, and changes to face features and skin tones!!... but I do feel like in the body types options the bitmojis lack variety...4 thin options and 1 heavy option isn’t very realistic, there HAS to be an option in between the last two body types, I’m some where in between, or I would say I’m the heavier body type without as big of a stomach...I don’t really like the eyes in this update either🤷🏽‍♀️ the eyelashes are nice tho. Also, the eyeshadows are fine, nothing amazing.. and the lipsticks are nice 👍🏽 
I really like the app. I’m really happy that I can finally get the right skin tone.   I’m asking for the option to change my glasses color. I have red glasses, I thought we would have had that option a long time ago but I guess if someone doesn’t say it it won’t happen.   Also more Afro hair styles and curly hair styles. I’ve never seen so many straight hair styles before.   Come on guys I know you can do it! ☺️ 
I was wondering why there aren’t any Valentines themed cloths/accessories. There were costumes for Halloween and cloths for Christmas. It would seem fitting for there to be stuff for Valentine’s Day as well.
hi, i love love love the avatars on bitmoji especially to use them on snapchat. but, they just don’t have calmer curly hair options. the closest to my hair is a wild curly hair sticking out in every direction. if you guys could create that version calmer you’d have 1 (most likely others too) more happier consumers! thank you!
Can we add more piercings? Or facial piercings? I have a septum piercing and think it would be cool to add
I think Bitmoji should have a design way by scanning your face then making the closest matching Bitmoji so you won’t have to make one.
So some of the outfits come with hats. I wish you had the option to not wear the hat. (I’m specifically talking about the hockey ones) I live the fact that they have sport outfits and they are amazing accept for the hockey beanies. Other than that I love the app.
I love this app and it’s coordinates with Snapchat! Although I’d like to see more variety in hair. They don’t have much curly hair options other than wavy hair and the bun.
The app works great and I love it but it sometimes gets a little slow with loading but other than that it’s a 👍
I love the new additions, BUT I desperately would love to see new & BETTER fashion. add earrings, bigger & fuller lips!!! please add back the pupil selection too.
I think there should be more tomboy type outfits for girls. Like boy outfits for girls. Both gender outfits that are more casual than fancy/official.
I love Bitmoji delxue but since updating I’m not getting alerts for snaps! I get an alert that says someone snapped me, I open Snapchat and there’s nothing. Then I go back on an hour later and it says something was delivered fourth minutes ago. Please fix this! It’s how I talk to most of my friends
Bitmoji is nice for people who are more city people but for me and others like me I don't wear stuff like that and I'm not that kind of person I'm more of a camouflage sweatshirt and boot cut jeans around my cowboy boy or jeans in my camouflage muck boots because I'm and hunter and fisher and I like going mudding on my four wheeler so if you read this you should add some changes- Gravy
Pls help me do the 2018 style plssss
Love the app but wish it was easier to find what I'm looking for and with the update, I got a new haircut but can't change my clothes!
I love these app because you can do more things on it 🍩🍩🍩🍩🍩🍩 but my hair think mermaid scales so 🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺
I never got the new update? Like with the new hair hairstyles and stuff I didn’t get that
This app is really cool and the idea behind it is great, although I wish they would add an edit option to certain characteristics. For example, be able to style hair just a little differently from what they have freely or even facial hair, at least for guys, I’m sure for girl avatars this would be a cool and useful option. Other than that, great app and love all the new additions!!
I hate the new hairstyles in today's update! I tried a few but didn't like any but couldn't return to my old one!  You need more options on length and hardly any have bangs!!
I really like this update its super slick. I really like all the hair options. Though we have more hair options, I feel like you kind of then took away the mouth (and other facial features) options. With the old version i had a facial feature that fit my face, but now you kind of took them all away. I really liked all the mouth options they had in the old version, but now there’s only 3, and they’re all the same width (and my mouth isn’t that wide). This is something pretty minor, but I did really like it. Otherwise I love bitmoji and I LOOVE how it’s connected to Snapchat :)
i really love this app; especially with the new bitmoji deluxe rolling out today! i do have some suggestions, though. could you possibly have teeth options? (gap tooth, crooked teeth, braces with customizable band colors?) i have braces and would love for my bitmoji to represent every aspect of me! also, height choices? 
i still don’t have the new bitmoji deluxe with all the features on the app yet?
Hi, i really like using bitmoji, but all my friends have upgraded to bitmoji deluxe. my app (iOS) still hasn't updated. i know you guys said that it would come to your users later but i mean come on, a day later than most everyone? do i have to update my software? send help!!
Used to really like this app. Decided to update, and tried to close out without switching to the deluxe version since the new version of my avatar is quite ugly and looks nothing like me anymore. Unfortunately the app changed it anyway and now it's stuck that way. I will probably delete the app unless the old version becomes an option again. 🙁
Nice app but there should be more body types. They are not very diverse
There are not any military themed bitmoji. This saddens me. But overall fun to include while messaging friends and family.
The new update is soo nice and a lot of new feature. Although isn’t states u have a high light and ombré option in hair style I can seem to find it?
The new deluxe bitmojis are so fun. I love all the new options, but what’s not awesome is the complete lack of body type diversity. Currently there are five options.... four of which are skinny. You can hardly tell the difference between any of them unless you click one and then four. The fifth option is literally just a circle. Why is there no in between? Before when there were limited options in every other category I was bothered, but I understood. Now you’re bragging about all the new options and somehow managed to leave out something that I would argue is one of the biggest factors in determining similarity. Fix this!
i love the new style and hair and everything that was just added, but it would be cool if you could separately choose your top, bottom, and shoes. it would make everyone one more unique. also, more weight sizes :)
y’all can add 20 different ways to style black hair but can’t add one pair of Asian eyes??🧐🧐
What happened to the long curly hairstyles?? Now my bitmoji looks nothing like me
It is amazing to see a great application in the store. I love it and I was using this app before long time. I don’t have any plans to change my idea about it. There are many but there is one great...thank you so much,,,
I updated the app but it’s not giving me any of the new features
🔥🔥🔥
I like the new update, need to add earrings though
Why does Bitmoji not have black hair styles (natural hair) Afros and braids for African American woman. The new update works for African American males. I still don’t see myself in this update.
About the only thing that is missing. Other than that. The app rocks. I would love a search bar for those moments I know exactly what Bitmoji to use but I just can’t find fast enough for comical timing. Timing is everyone in comedy. Lol. No in all seriousness, a search bar would be great.
They think of everything! If you can't find a bitmoji for what you want to say... say something else. They're adorable and accurate and always current. But there's soooo many of them and all shoved into four categories, which means you have to sift through dozens to try to find the one you want. They need a search option or pop-out menu with categories like "sorry" and "miss you" and "sarcastic" and whatnot. I've opted not to send one more than once because by the time I found what I wanted, the convo has moved on. Otherwise, I love this app. Also, needs more "miss you" options. I have very dear people halfway across the country in opposite directions and I miss them and need more ways to say so. Like "really miss you" and "missing you hard" and sappy stuff like that lol. Great and fun app!!
I don't like it never baaaaad 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
The update got rid of my current bitmoji look!! The new bitmoji strips style no loner looks like me, and the hair is all drawn very weirdly, and not enough medium hair styles. The biggest issue are the lack of outfits. Why does every female outfit include heels. Why can’t female bitmoji’s choose clothes from the male bitmoji side and vice versa. Its 2018!!! Update already.
This new update is so amazing it’s awesome that y’all finally added in more diverse skin types and hair colors plus the makeup! The app is so much more fun to use now and I love all of the different hairstyles, although I still would love for their to be braids but other than that amazing job!
Allow us to use pre made selfies you sacks of crap
1) forgot flat asian nose. not everyone has a nose bridge. everything looks ok but the nose just really makes me not look like me 2) the bigger glasses frames cover eyebrows. position those glasses lower no one wears their glasses all the way up 3) still no good clothes 
This is amazing especially w/ the new update, compared to my old Bitmoji, my new one looks even more like me! Keep up the grate work!
It was cute and all but before the new style I really liked this and it’s cool and all but you guys changed the eyes on the other styles which is so upsetting to me Cause I think my bitmoji was perfect and I accidentally changed it to the new style and I just wish I had my old one back  Like the eyes aren’t the same they look so scared and it’s so annoying 
Love the new customization but I’m a mix of asian and Hawaiian so the skin colors available don’t really fit. Also would love if there were new clothing or a way to mix and match!!
This update is actually pretty inclusive. It adds very many hairstyles and colors to fit everyone. One recommendation I have is a half and half hair color ? Also some more outfits to fit more styles not just basics. Thank you for continuing to make the bitmoji app better and better!
I have bitmoji its cool and all I recently heard that there is a deluxe version so I updated the app and it doesn’t let me use it 🤷🏻‍♀️
Bring back the lip sizing!
Gucci like the shirts with the snakes on em
So now we have plenty of hair options, which is great, but only three choices for lips, which is

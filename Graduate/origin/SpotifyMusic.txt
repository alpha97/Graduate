Be prepared to have to push a button for every single song you want to listen to. I have tried everything and the next song on my playlist or on whatever album I am listening to won‚Äôt play. There is no customer service or help at Spotify. Time to find a new music service.
Usability: - thumb up/down in radio are opposite analogous heart/ban in Daily Mix - not car friendly. Too easy to hit devices menu  Features: - no option to ban artist  - no dynamic radio from saved songs  - no multi seed radio - no smart playlists (e.g. added to songs in last 16 days, songs that start with 'm', etc) - shuffle hasn‚Äôt worked correctly for years - can‚Äôt see a list of ALL songs by an artist - no watch app for cellular use 
I want to sort playlists. Most recently added to the top of the list. I sort on the desktop app but it doesn't respect it on my phone. I know I could manually move them but who wants to manually do that to 300 +songs on a playlist. Which is typical for me.
there are way too many ads. i started using pandora because these ads are killing me, there‚Äôs so many of them and they‚Äôre all the same.
I love this app!! So convenient and I love it‚Äôs free!
I have been using Spotify for about two years now and everything has been working out just fine. However, with the newest update I keep tapping on my music but it won‚Äôt play! Going to try and restart my phone.
I love Spotify and I got my whole family into it too, but lately I've been having trouble downloading albums. I tried to download an album and it worked but it never worked offline and that kinda defeats the purpose. It's really frustrating me and I don't want to cancel my premium and delete the app, but it's not making me happy anymore.
There are way to many ads. The same 4 ads are constantly played, and to be honest get extremely annoying. For a phone you can't play any song any any time, but on a computer you can. The computer version is way better. (You also get unlimited skips)
That‚Äôs the only problem, also I don‚Äôt want to pay to listen to whatever song I want
Spotify offers good music and quality but I find it hard to find specific songs as not much options of filtering songs are available. Or if you want to delete a song from a playlist it gets kind of hard. They should add a force touch options panel.
I would recommend SoundCloud!!
Daughter introduced me to Spotify and I am hooked! Perfect for all my music needs! Driving, sleeping, entertaining, grandkids, mom time, mellow time, cleaning music!! So glad I am a premium member!
App gets better with every update unlike every other apps out there. So awesome!!!
I love the app, but please bring back the feature where you can hold down on a song to play a few seconds of the song as a preview.
When adding songs to my queue, the last song in the queue disappears. (iPhone only, my iPad is fine) It‚Äôll still play, but since it‚Äôs invisible I can‚Äôt tell what song it is or move/remove it from the queue. Very irritating, and it‚Äôs been around for quite awhile now.  Other than that, I really love Spotify. The app could be better ‚Äî especially on other platforms ‚Äî and I‚Äôd really love a native version for tvOS and watchOS. I can‚Äôt speak to the greatness of the free version (I‚Äôve never had it) but Spotify Premium is amazing! 
Why???
it's good
It‚Äôs amazing but I can‚Äôt choose a song
Spotify is my ish!!! Pandora! Pandora who?!?!
Really good music and you can get your favorite artist like blackbear
If you are looking for a app that downloads music and organize your content then this app is for you. It is fantastic
Spotify used to provide fantastic beat-per-minute playlists and functionality for runners which they have inexplicably chosen to retire without any prior announcement or explanation. As of the last patch, Spotify is nothing more than just another mediocre music app.   While I can‚Äôt see a direct connection, I also find it interesting that Spotify just filed with the SEC to have an IPO, despite reportedly losing cash consistently over the recent past. Maybe the intentional disabling of the run functionality is because Spotify lacks some key intellectual property, which makes their business model unsustainable and the IPO is just an effort to cash in before it all collapses.   Suffice it to say I loved the app and am not alone in my disappointment. As of this writing, there are 18 pages of baffled, upset comments with no reply from Spotify. Many of these users, like myself, have canceled their $9.99/month Premium account and deleted the app in disgust. 
I use this app all the time get the app now
In the newest model has a habit of playing song that isn‚Äôt even in your playlist which is so aggravating when you‚Äôre trying to play your favorite song and it wants to not let you it‚Äôs freaking retarded and needs to be fixed now Spotify!!!!!
Ist free and no paying and mix music üëçüëçüëç
Remember when we use to take those little cassette tapes, put them in our oversized tape decks and wait until the radio played our jams? We were never quite on point. Anywhere from a few seconds to minutes late. Sometimes, we found ourselves at the end of the song because we would be thrown off by the chorus and weren‚Äôt sure how far into a song we were.   Gone are those days of terrible file sharing programs where it could take a whole day just to download one song. And if you didn‚Äôt know how to use it, then you better find someone who did or you were s******.   Who can forget paying anywhere from 99 cents to a 1.99 for a song in iTunes. When you came back to it some time later down the road you might have lost your greatest hits collection by ABBA, Metallica, Siouxie and the Banshees, or whatever time relished artist you overplayed at the time.  Or how about that other guy whose random mixes you would peruse for free and then turn around and look up and put on your Spotify playlist? Sorry, Pandora.  How many other reasons or stars do I need to give?   Well done Spotify. 
App keeps closing out
It's way better than Apple Music. Free Version is a Pandora on steroids and Premium blows Apple Music out the water. Don't spend that $10/month on that BS you usually spend it on and spend it on your playlist.
I love the app. The only problem I have is that there is no organization for playlists. I wish you could have different folders to put playlists into. I make a playlist for every month and I‚Äôve been doing it for 2 years so there‚Äôs a lot of them. I just wish I could have a folder for all of my monthly playlists so my library isn‚Äôt so crowded.
I love the app but it won‚Äôt let me upgrade to premium. I go to account and click every button in the settings and none of them let me upgrade. I really wanna UPGRADE!!!!!!!!!!üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
I love that you give 30 minute ad breaks, this app doesn‚Äôt have many songs I like. The ads are very short but once again we shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for no ads. Over all this app is fine when I go to school I get 30 minutes of ad free music so I use the six cord and listen to music on my way there and my school is 25 minutes.
love this they should offer this more often but def will purchase when my weeks up. highly recommend. üëçüèºüî•
it very goodüëåüèª
This app is amazing! I can listen to whatever I want when I want!
I love it!
Love the freedom of exploring different genres of music!!
Quality of sound is awesome
I like it
I love being able to choose what I listen to. That is a big benefit over pandora.   When I use the app it will just randomly pause. This isn't a connection problem but a new issue.   Secondly, the Spotiambi exploit I can‚Äôt get rid of and the developers haven‚Äôt seemed to care about fixing whatever security hole this exploit accesses. 
Hands down one of the best apps I have been using. No commercials! Endless music! What else can you ask for? Namaste all!
I love the app just don‚Äôt really like the new look to the layout of everything, I think it‚Äôs a little confusing and will be hard to get used to.
You will find music to play for all the moods all the timings and probably all the situations like working in office, driving or gymming.
Las m√∫sica
Why if you say add to your library and add it then you go to it and it plays a different song
There is a defect going on with the way the computer is able to scroll down songs . I actually have to click the song now instead of just scrolling regularly. It‚Äôs so frustrating ....
This is cool
I love the app because it has all of the music I love
Featured on the Rockstar Social Club site in order to play the ‚Äúfull‚Äù tracks. Only, you need to make an account & payment plan just to play anything. Is there any app that features anything else but its own ads? Think about it.
5stars
Signed up for a free trial... once you download the app you have to login each time you open. The app often glitches and you have to re-login...  once your free trial is up you can‚Äôt sign up to continue premium through the app you have to log out of the app re login at your computer and then select you want to continue and they already have your CC info... don‚Äôt waste your time. Head to Apple Music. 
Love
Best ever
I really like the fact that you can add your favorite songs to a playlist and stuff
This app is so easy to use and is better than all the rest.
Only good thing is cody Jinks playlist set ups & longnecks.
Not really into it.  No need to download if ur not gonna pay
I don‚Äôt think I could live without this app
It dose not let me add songs to my playlist 
When i am in my car i play the app but for some reason stop when play one or two songs and i need to unlock my phone to play the music and then stop when play one or two songs again is only when the phone is lock. Pleases fix this problem
Whats not love? Auto suggestions, short ads and a great selection of music make spotify the top slugger in the game!
Amazing
My sister and I wanted to share Spotify premium to save some money and it‚Äôs impossible to listen to music at the same time. We can‚Äôt share an account. This should be possible.
It‚Äôs an amazing app.
You can find and play any song at anytime you want
Great content and the ability to listen to playlists offline is really important to me- I like to run, hike, and adventure where there‚Äôs no cell service üòé
I love it
I most certainly prefer Spotify over pandora or any other music players. I love that i can follow other users playlists and download the music that i want. So convenient for road trips.
I used to have this on my previous phone and loved it because it would still work even in the worst service areas (I.e work freezer during inventory), I got a new phone and went to re download it and now I can‚Äôt even get past the main screen, won‚Äôt let me log in or create a new account the buttons do nothing when you ‚Äúclick‚Äù them.... pretty upset about losing my favorite music app
How can we update with any confidence if the developer doesn't include a single detail ever when there's a change in the app version?  I'm not paying to be your tester. I'm sure everyone would appreciate details as to what each update is actually for. One star until you do a better job!  UPDATE: Feb 28 update has no details still. Lame. 
They just removed the running feature with no announcement. I found out after reaching out to their customer service after a version update.  You don‚Äôt remove a software feature just like that - you improve it, and make it better! I will cancel my premium membership in response to Spotify‚Äôs cancelling my favorite feature! 
I wanted to get premium to listin to a full song and can‚Äôt even do that so now I am deleting it because it simply does not allow me to play my music how I want great job with messing this app up developer
I have had this app for a long time and I have to say, this is the best music app I ever had!! I love the option of making your playlist ‚Äúoff-line‚Äù option that comes with subscription so it doesn‚Äôt use excess data. The free version is also good too. Keep the updates coming!!!
The reason I rated Spotify the way I did because you don‚Äôt have unlimited skip and not every body can afford premium
I love Spotify just needs to have more skips
It is da best
Best music streaming app out there, the music library is enormous, new music release show up in this app to streaming almost the same day. The one thing I love the most is the audio quality, you can hear all the notes clear (320kbps). Comparing to other music streaming apps this is the only one to include a graphic equalizer, you can either increase the thumping bass or clear mids or the soft highs (I asked them to include this equalizer feature and they listened ! ). The app and streaming is free but I would recommend paying for the upgrade to listen to any music you want. Aside from all, this is also the only music streaming app to include music video for some song which is awesome ! Thanks for reading my review.
Way too expensive for a year!
It‚Äôs been my go to music app for quite some time. I‚Äôll switch it up here and there with different apps if I‚Äôm digging for some new mashups and such but this is a solid app for any music lover!
That‚Äôs all. Otherwise it‚Äôs all good
Good
Way better than any other streaming service.
Just bought a new phone & thought I had to start over. Next time I signed in, everything was there and I never downloaded anything! Love no ads...
The best music app and very much worth the money for premium
I tried to log on after downloading it and it just stays on the welcome screen. I even downloaded it again and same thing.
Pick me up and I‚Äôm down for Spotify, I freakin love you guys!!!
Flawless
Problem as above
At first I loved this app but now I can‚Äôt do anything to it. I can‚Äôt listen to songs offline without buying a premium feature, I can‚Äôt skip songs, I can‚Äôt download songs, I can‚Äôt pick songs I have to listen to them in order. There is just a bunch of things wrong with this app that I can‚Äôt even listen to MY music. I don‚Äôt want to buy any features, I want to listen to songs everywhere, even offline, and I would like to pick my songs. Plz fix this and make it available for free instead of paying for extra stuff. I want to enjoy music, not be frustrated because I can‚Äôt find any apps that will actually work. Plz fix and thx for the effort you put in this app.
If your not paying for it, it‚Äôs useless, still love Spotify though üòâ
Great
Great app!! No more pandora for me
With the most recent update, the app has been doing the strangest thing to podcasts. It will not pick up where it left off if I close and reopen the app later. Each time I‚Äôve had to scrub to where I think I was at before. Please fix.
Everything good but wish premium was cheaper
I have been using Spotify for 4 years and when I started out I started out using the free version and having 0 issues. I loved it so much that I decided to go Premium. My brother was intrigued by Spotify also and we shared an account for a long time. I really like how easy and simple it is for multiple people to be under one premium account. The only thing bad about sharing an account is that only one person can listen to music online at a time, but since you can download music and listen offline, that problem is easily solved. After using Spotify for 3 years I inspired my entire family to use Spotify and now we have the Spotify Family Package and I now have my own account to use all the time. I love Spotify and my entire family loves it too. This is by far the best music streaming service and is most fair with the free version. I appreciate everyone at the Spotify Company and will always use Spotify to listen to music before anything else. My only concern with Spotify now is the load time for the app and the software on the computer. I always end up having to wait a few minutes for the software to open and load all the pages and sometimes it‚Äôs frustrating once it hits 10 minutes. Hopefully there is a way to fix the load time on the media player for the PC downloaded version.
I love Spotify!!!!! I
Please
Also would be nice to be able to add or remove multiple songs at once from playlists
Best way to listen to music. Period.
I use Spotify for students and it‚Äôs the best way to listen to current music. The only thing that could be better is an easier way to track your accounts and subscriptions. Overall better than Pandora, most definitely!
I do not like this app. You can not hear the song you want. There are other app that listen to the music you want. all the people I know do not like spotify because they can not hear what they want is forced shuffle play. thanks
Fantastic app
Need to be able to enlarge
I love the music but wish there was a way to have clean playlists, that you can play with your 8 year old in the room during workouts! Use the radio edit versions perhaps...
Plays music well and allows you to make custom playlists but I will get around 45-60 seconds of ads each time and it doesn‚Äôt even stay on my playlists.
5 stars for the service. Minus 2 stars for all the dozens of app updates with no details on what the changes are from version to version. Sooo annoying.
Great app for music! And I love it to see my favorite YouTube vlogers music videos in a music app that u can follow them
can you like fix the ads? they just keep coming up and freezing the whole app. also, why the hell do you constantly recommend songs? i saved the songs i like because i want to listen to them, not their related songs. and no, premium isn‚Äôt an option for me, it costs to frickin much. other than that i like free music and that‚Äôs the only redeeming quality of this app
Great app for listening to your favorite artist and discover new music
Ififc
I love the app but can you please allow people to change the picture of their playlists using the app. I usually have to do it on pc but it would be a lot nicer to just use the pictures on my phone. Thank you
Way better than pandora
Has almost every band I was looking for.
4 stars for a solid app but continuously lazy developer information on new updates. People want to know what‚Äôs changing. Stop being lazy.
I used most online streaming music services and Spotify is really best!
The new update is awful! I can‚Äôt even figure out how to use it ... so far it‚Äôs taking the path of Snapchat (New update makes it hard / confusing to use )
Happy
When you push heart icon in the bottom left while listening any song in daily mix app just crashes(iPhone 6s, iOS 10.3.3)  Very frustrating... 
It is really really hard to add a device on my account!!!!üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
I enjoy my library I have made it is a real Reflection of how I listen to music and enjoy my life Spotify is more artist and more digital library and podcasting any other music experience on the Internet I highly recommend it and give it a five star review thank you so much exclusively painter J Barnes
This used to be a fine app. But for some unknown reason, I now cannot log into my account that I was able to do just yesterday. What happened? Something has changed, and has completely removed my username & password. Spotify does not know I even exist. Their website is even worse, because they want you to log in (that‚Äôs funny since that DOES NOT WORK) to your account which is now gone. It‚Äôs a shame, because the competition is even worse, if that‚Äôs possible. The "support community" on the website is nonsense. However, Spotify did me a favor by deleting my account. So I will delete their app. They made it easy. BYE BYE.  UPDATE: They are still awful. Don‚Äôt waste your time or money with this app.  UPDATE #2: Still awful. Broken app, broken  service, total waste of time. Go elsewhere for your music.

Amazing
Best music platform there is. Premium is so cheap and so worth it.
üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº
I‚Äôve pretty much near forced people to get Spotify premium because it is so worth it. It allows you access to basically all music at any time. Anything you feel like hearing is at your fingertips with this app. I‚Äôve never come across any music app that even compares. Getting Spotify premium literally changed not only the way I listen to music, but even my music taste itself was able to evolve quicker and branch out more than I thought possible. If you‚Äôre really serious about music, you will fall in love with Spotify especially with premium. I  could not recommend this more. Ditch all the other music apps because Spotify has everything you need right here.
I can listen whenever
Why does Spotify play random songs that are not in my playlist
Number one music app
Me encanta Spotify
Music is my world,thank you,great app.
Its a awesome app.I love that you can choose from many artists to listen to!Its great:))
Bring back the Touch Preview on iOS.
Oranges being Spotify in this analogy. This app is insane! It cannot be compared. They really have thought of everything when making this user friendly. From editing playlists, to finding the most popular music (literally down to the day). From millennial to baby boomers. You won‚Äôt have a problem operating this app. From rap music lovers to classical music junkies. You won‚Äôt have a problem finding music. Extremely organized and brilliant. 10 stars!!! P.s. IF YOU HAVE A SONOS; THIS IS THE MUSIC PLAYER FOR YOU!! No need to control all your music directly from the SONOS app anymore. Control the volume from the lock screen and change the QUEUE right from the Spotify app. Don‚Äôt like edited music? Well, say goodbye to worrying if the next song is going to be edited. It won‚Äôt ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I am a totally blind user, this application works excellent for the user interface is very well streamed and it works wonderful I have tried other music application services on my iPhone and android platforms and this is sets the gold standard my name is Richard from Youngstown Ohio
Don‚Äôt ask for a review for a review -they prob will give one anyway,Cathy moore
Spotify wins hands down! Apple has gotten to big for it self  and lost site of what customer satisfaction and service excellence means- Spotify give you variety, flexibility control of playlist and down loads. Spotify is great!
Totally recommend.. it‚Äôs amazing and they created a playlist of my favorites all together!üíïüíïüíï
I love this app to listen to all my favorite songs
Just because
Got this today, along with spotify premium. Opened the app to use it, neither the ‚Äúlog in‚Äù or ‚Äúsign up‚Äù buttons work. Nothing with work. Frustrating and pointless.
Excellent song here
I love Spotify. I have premium for for at the moment. I wish the price wasn‚Äôt so much. I‚Äôm a student and it‚Äôs hard to enjoy music because i have to WiFi. Spotify is the only thing i can listen to music on (because of internet connection). It‚Äôs hard being a student and having to add that to my monthly due just to listen to music. I‚Äôm not trying to bash or anything by the way just stating my opinion and situation.
In short, it‚Äôs good to listen to music with this app but always with the occasional ad every now and then
Having the newest song and playing them anywhere for a low price is great
It has to many ads
I don‚Äôt usually write reviews or whatever, but I use Spotify everyday. It goes to an advertisement and then plays 2 seconds of the next song and then skips it to the one after that. It keeps using up my skips. And whenever I play a playlist it keeps putting it on radio, and it‚Äôs really buggin. Other than that, It‚Äôs a really nice app.
I use Spotify pretty much everyday, and it‚Äôs a really good app to have, although I wish I could reset my daily mixes
Hands down best song app. Especially with the customizable eq!
You should add an option to transfer all songs from a playlist to another one please other than that this is my favorite music app
Spotify is one of the best ways to get the music that you want when you want and it‚Äôs even FREE, except if you upgrade to premium
This app used to be my favorite music app I love how you could multitask and listen to new and old music. This app has something for everyone. You used to be able to play 1 album of a certain artist and hear a commercial or 2. That was fine. But now it shuffles all different people AND YOU HAVE NO CHOICE!  I don‚Äôt if it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt have premium but this is garbage.  WHAT HAPPENED SPOTIFY!? ü§¨ 
It worth the money. Basically any artist/band and song is at youre fingerprints and it extremely easy to use.
I‚Äôm trying to figure out how much the premium is but every time I tried to click something it will not send me to it.
I need more skips make it 10
I love this app I like the music they got. I just wish you just could reduce the ads a bit.
I like it but I want to listen only to my playlist but plays other songs
Awesome App,...love it!
This app is great it has a playlist for everything keep up the good work improving the app.  -Rafa Afar 
I don‚Äôt like how it have ads
Sometimes it changes my music and I don‚Äôt even do anything to to it. And I hate that u make people have to pay to play music offline. In the next couple of days, I might delete my account and never use it. And sometimes it pauses my music and I hate it.
Loving Regulation Planet!
You can‚Äôt even play a specific song from your library unless you ‚ÄúShuffle‚Äù the playlist. I don‚Äôt know if a ‚Äúfree‚Äù app can get worse than that.
I love this app especially all the Kpop songs thanks lol üòÇ/also could you please put twices likey and TT on here the Korean version of TT
Musical freedom..... üé∂  Thank you, Spotify. 
I love that you let us search up song but when I was searching up ‚ÄúBodak Yellow clean‚Äù it showed more song that are clean. But other than that I love the app!
Spotify has been a great way to curate my music library, and the Song Preview feature helped me skim through albums and playlists quickly in order to discover more music much more efficiently.  Please bring the Song Preview back, I would love to adjust this to 5 stars. 
This is an AMAZING App it is great for leasing on the go.  Only thing is I order to play off line you have to get premium which cost .99 a month, but other then that highly recommend
It‚Äôs an amazing app if you are looking at songs in computers or iPads. iPhones are different story.   You can‚Äôt choose the song you wanna play if you don‚Äôt have premium? That‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous. It‚Äôs not fair that on iPads you can play any song you want but on phones you have to pay. Ridiculous. Please change this feature. 
I absolutely LOVE the new picture backgrounds while songs are playing. Stunning and better shows the artist/album.
I recently got it and i cannot stand that when we our listening to our own playlist we have skips, they should be unlimited for our own playlist and and when i am listening to a radio it takes me to other tracks.
Nothing like the computer version, can‚Äôt do anything but shuffle play without premium. Ads struggle to load as well.
The app is fine. I don‚Äôt have premium, so I deal with ads every so often but I don‚Äôt care about that too much. What I do care about is that there are certain trigger applications (Tumblr, Domino‚Äôs) that will cause the music to pause. I‚Äôve never had this issue before.
Thais is a nice app but premium is SOO expensive and they want you to buy it really bad.
You need to stop making us use skips and wait an hour to get skips
I like it but I who‚Äôs it didn‚Äôt have commercials and skip all that u want that skip part is flipping weird
Can you stop putting unrelated music into my playlists and making me question if I actually put it there, question whether it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve heard before, and making me stop what I‚Äôm doing to figure that out ok thank you
Currently a premium subscriber for over 3 years and I can‚Äôt be more satisfied with this ap. Great ap, amazing platform, smooth look, great song selection, A+ on every aspect. After using Apple Music, Pandora, and YouTube red I know that this is truly the best music streaming platform out. The only suggestion I have is for Spotify to be more flexible with the artists so they can put more content up. Also, maybe some mixtape action? Other than that ***** five star quality!
Edit Spotify so that u can put any song on u want at any time without premium
Just recently got unlimited data so i looked at Spotify and thought... Life is good.
The app runs smoothly, and even for being just a basic free member, I still have all my jams free to listen to over wifi! The playlists and radio stations have a huge variety and I sometimes can't stop listening for hours. 10/10 would headbang again- Harrison
My music keeps randomly pausing whenever I play it. And it happens ALL OF THE TIME
it used to be good now it‚Äôs trash it plays random songs and i tried to play my playlists and it did not work
You can't listen to individual songs, it just skips to recommended or a random song if you don't have premium
Spotify is well worth what I pay monthly my music comes with me wherever I go. I am not much of a secular music listener, however the worship music mix they have is amazing, I would highly recommend this app even to all those who love to get their praise on, early in the morning, at night, or whenever, wherever.
I‚Äôve tried reinstalling and it still won‚Äôt stop skipping or pausing my songs. Extremely annoying
It‚Äôs so great. Can‚Äôt drive without it
The adds take forever to load. No way to delete or move songs by bulk.
I understand that Spotify has to make money and that is why there are ads which I‚Äôm fine with. But is there a reason that when I play a playlist it will play a couple of songs from that playlist and then play a bunch of songs I‚Äôve never heard before the shuffle play system just seems a little flawed.
Actually has music, most apps that I get have ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù for popular artists.
App is amazing. Best music app on the market. But I do get frustrated I cannot shuffle through a playlist or repeat songs. It doesn‚Äôt work consistently but when I can get it to work I can‚Äôt stop it from shuffling or repeating songs or playlist. This has happened through multiple iOS updates and app updates. And two different iPhone devices. It‚Äôs not that big a deal but sometimes I get frustrated. All in all best music app on the market!
Spotify retains payment information even after subscription ends, with no way to remove it.   Spotify's censorship in response to social trends is also troublesome since social trends constantly shift and, especially recently, become more authoritarian. If the message is truly egregious, demonetizing music is an option. Demonetization is only hostile to the artist, whereas outright censorship is hostile to artist and customer. Or a disclaimer could indicate that the message does not reflect the company's values. A streaming service should be largely indistinguishable from a massive record library. The integrity of the library should remain intact as much as possible without corporate intervention.  Spotify in general does not show much regard for customer choice. We should be free to choose how we use the service and to be secured when Spotify's security is eventually compromised. 
The app keep deleting my music and recently i noticed it deleted over half of my entire music library. That around 800 songs that went missing and now i dont even know which ones they were
Great App
‚ûøüí¶
Can‚Äôt turn off this feature that always intrudes my playback screen
Hands down the best music app. I‚Äôve been able to listen every song I‚Äôve ever searched or wanted to listen to. They‚Äôve got it all. Would pay up front for a lifetime membership if that was a option. It‚Äôs that good.
Love this amazing!! And she is 16!! She is going to be HUGE! Can‚Äôt wait for more music by Sophia Dion!!
Why do I have to pay to pick a song
It is used to be a good app for music lovers. But nowadays, there are so many disappointments in this app. They ever show to buy a premium and make the normal user disappointment. Now I found the nice music player like this. But it is more convenient and much better than this. It‚Äôs (JOOX). Now I uninstalled and change to JOOX.
I have been an Apple Music user forever, this by far is much better!! It tells me when I‚Äôm adding a duplicate song, unlike Apple , when I Shazaam a song it gives me the option to add to specific playlist or play it. Apple not only lets me keep adding songs that I already have, but when I delete one duplicate it deletes them all!!! Thanks Spotify!!!
Best app i used
Great !!
A great app but a little problem . When our premium accounts ends, after charging we should download all songs again. I mean,songs get lost
Hey I love Spotify! I even have Spotify premium and it‚Äôs probably one of my best investments BUT there‚Äôs this little bug where when I make one of my playlists collaborative, it hides the playlist from people. Like when my friends wanna share a playlist (because I mean 3 heads are better than one) I would create the playlist and make it collaborative and they wouldn‚Äôt be able to find it. Or they would have the playlist; I would make it collaborative because they had a few song suggestions and the playlist would completely disappear. And only from other people‚Äôs phones because it would still show on my phone ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è anyways just wanted to let you know so you can make your app even better! Love you guys!
This is my very favorite app! Haven't been disappointed yet! From the daily mix's to the random suggestions! Thanks Spotify!
Great app but sometimes after an advertisement i cant exit out of it
Just the best music app for me
I love this app but it won‚Äôt let you thumbs down a song that‚Äôs already been thumbs upped. Pandora has been doing this forever, why haven‚Äôt y‚Äôall caught up? I want to renew my subscription but I just don‚Äôt know
Love it
I love Spotify but lately it has been changing songs and even whole stations on its own I pay for premium because I use it at work all day and while driving but at this rate I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll have it much more I‚Äôve deleted and reinstall the app 3 times to try and fix it but no luck it is still doing this and I‚Äôm the app there is no way of sending a message to a tech support to even try and get this fixed. At lest pandora doesn‚Äôt change songs and stations.
I love how I can play my music, but I can‚Äôt go back to listen to it again and again cause it only plays the songs if it in shuffle I‚Äôm mad at that.
The interface isn‚Äôt as easy to use as Apple Music. My #1 complaint is that you can‚Äôt edit the album artwork for playlists. There doesn‚Äôt appear to be a way to see if a track has already been added to a playlist.
I LOVE THIS APP!!!! U CAN FIND ANY MUSIC FOR FREEEEEEE!!!üòâüòâüòâüòâüòâüòâüòâüòéüòéüòéüòéüòé
I understand the whole premium thing but the people who don‚Äôt have premium or can‚Äôt afford it monthly should be able to at least add songs to play next, my friend can do it but she doesn‚Äôt have premium and I find it a bit unfair.
Love the app and he fact that Skimm makes suggestions. They never fail me.
Es lo m√°ximo!
Day two using Spotify during workout. So much better than pandora. Sorry I didn‚Äôt switch sooner.
Like every other company, once money starts flying in, you disregard your customers. If you guys just genuinely cared and listened to us on your forums you would know what we really want. I wont waste all my time and discus all the things here but I would like to share a popular suggestion. We should be able to change our playlist art from mobile devices too.
The free version could be better with limited downloads even with ads and let us choose what we want to listen to.
Switches genres way to much.  It goes from my awesome worship to some nasty booty banging songs. What‚Äôs up with that SPOTIFY
My life would be lost without music, and I love how Spotify is set up and all the different options it has there is music for everyone and almost every situation and it‚Äôs so user friendly.
Just starting this app. Fast to get used to. I like it so far. Still learning!!
Good shuffling Love the playlist suggestions and discover features. 
I've had an issue that's plagued my phone for the last week or two. After the new Spotify update installed the app is dark like it's still waiting to be updated. I can't even delete the app & redownload it. Pressing the delete button does nothing to help.
Good alternative to Pandora or slacker. :)
Awesome!!
Please give people the option to ->choose<- whether to view ‚ÄúGenius lyrics‚Äù pop ups as opposed to playlist videos or zoomed-in album covers when listening to hit playlists etc. It would be nice to be able to choose, I really like the Genius feature and I was sad when it was removed from some of the major Spotify playlists.‚Äù  Also, maybe it‚Äôs just iOS, but why aren‚Äôt we able to hover over a song and hear a sample of it anymore?? I absolutely loved that feature, so was it deleted or made premium or something else? 
They keep offering the 30-day trial to me but once I click on it it‚Äôd ask me to pay and it‚Äôs good just 120 a year is too much
The best thing that ever happened to me right next to my wife. If I lost Spotify I‚Äôd lose one of my best friends. From punk music to podcasts Spotify has you covered !
üó£Spotify
This is a really good app it so good i get to pick what I what I can skip how many times I to do i told my friends and they like it to and you have you guys have a good very good choices
Good very good
Is better then sound cloud to me
Spotify is your top music app if you‚Äôre looking for soemthing that has everything for free!
I went to get the ‚Äú60 days free premium‚Äù thing but it only lasted for a week or so. This will just make me hate Spotify more and more if this continues to happen.
Please someone tell me
I hate it. It doesn‚Äôt work. Glitches and nonsense. I‚Äôm angered. Better off just buying the music or using YouTube or pandora. Honestly this app is a joke on any device.
As much I have loved Spotify over the years, if I am paying for premium why in the world do I have limits to the number of songs I download; things like this don‚Äôt make it feel like this is truly premium
Like it
Best music app of 2018
Not having premium makes this app completely worthless
Always the best thank you
I feel that you should be able to choose a song on Spotify without premium
So I was an avid Apple Music user but I always wanted to get Spotify. I recently downloaded it and switched to Spotify and I have no regrets! The interface in this app is wayyyyy more fluid and works great. It took me some time to really understand the app, but overall great. Also, the computer version works just as great compared to iTunes. Would definitely recommend switching if you are on the fence about whether or not you should.
Love it! Very easy to operate, customer for life!
Spotify developers or whoever is in charge. Why did you guys remove the running playlists, for where you could run to your own tempo. I really enjoyed running the ‚ÄúEscape‚Äù playlist and tuning the music to my own running tempo. I‚Äôm so upset that it‚Äôs gone! BRING IT BACK PLEASE!!!!
yup
It‚Äôs good, but I have money in my phone account, but it doesn‚Äôt let me update to Spotify Premium üòûüòû
that‚Äôs the only reason i‚Äôve kept you for so long! where‚Äôs my ‚Äúdetecting tempo‚Äù lady? without her, i‚Äôm moving over to free google music!! 
It will randomly just stop playing after an add. It gets extremely annoying when you have to restart the app just to listen to music again. Happens frequently as well
Very good very good
Great
I hated it
A fine service ‚Äòtis
I love this app so much!!! I tell all my friends about it and they love it! Plus it‚Äôs really cheap to get premium like me if you don‚Äôt have data (aka: WiFi). I love this
Terrific
Awesome can download music free but you have to pay to play so 4 star
A cor do app n√£o fala muito bem dos seus designers. Poderiam se espelhar em algo mais leve. O conte√∫do √© muito bom a qualidade de transmiss√£o tamb√©m mas lamento insistir, o visual √© deprimente.
Awesome except they use an ad campaign comparable to Japanese Water torture. Listening for a few hours you hear the same ad over, and , over, etc. Then they pile them on and ads play back to back to back. Forcing you to go Premium. Web browser player is better than mobile though.
I LOVE THIS APP! I can listen to anything I want, and it even helps me find NEW music. GET THIS APP!
Corridos de Caballos
When you want a song,Look it up in SPOTIFY!üëå
i recommend
The mix I made on Spotify is encouraging and helps me through those hard workouts
This is good
How about we stop trying to A/B test customers every other week so that we can learn to use the app before you change it. What happened to downloaded? I downloaded an album and now where am I supposed to go to make it show up? Oh there‚Äôs not a place? I guess I‚Äôll just search again making the process STUPIDLY redundant. Stop trying to fix what‚Äôs not broken! UPDATE: and there‚Äôs not even a previously searched function?! How the hell am I supposed to find that band that I downloaded this morning that my friend mentioned in passing? Good lord Spotify. I guess if you‚Äôre successful enough you just turn into a bloated piece of rubbish. UPDATE2: okay, the album was even ‚Äúsaved‚Äù but there is no place to see me ‚Äúsaved‚Äù music! Are you kidding me!? Holy Cow, did you guys swipe up the brightness minds from REAL player or something? 
The best streaming service ever.
Anything you want,Anytime you Want!!OnPoint...
It‚Äôs so cool that you can have your own playlists for free!
Durisimo
Listen without WiFi which is freaken great
The suggested tracks are SO ANNOYING. They make me waste skips and there are usually a big string of them. I would give five stars if it weren‚Äôt for this crappy feature. Please please please fix this.
Awesome

Love the mixes available ! There isn‚Äôt a song I like that I cannot find ! So quick and easy and the premium accounts are totally worth the listening freedom. -username; Trashedmedia
This is a good app and works well but, there are way too many ads!!! I might have to look into finding a better music app because the ads last almost a minute and occur every 3 or so songs. Need to fix this ASAP.
Every time I try to play music it keeps pausing out of now were . Please fix it or I‚Äôm not paying for this
Had a good amount of songs saved from albums, now they are no where to be found. Even tried looking them up again and they are gone. Smh
Ps the i
No problems pretty good but nothing is perfect so can‚Äôt leave a perfect review
Just annoyed that you can‚Äôt use the app if you‚Äôre more than 14 days in a foreign county.
Only gives u 5 skips also doesn't play the songs in ur playlist in the right order
I like the idea of free music and I can understand the premium things in the app, but the amount of things that I can‚Äôt do even though it would greatly benefit the creators to allow me to is frustrating. I‚Äôm forced to shuffle my music and then there are song suggestions for artists I don‚Äôt even like in the slightest. On top of that I can‚Äôt even skip the song after a certain amount, I can understand the suggestions as I don‚Äôt have premium, but I honestly just want to listen to fob not someone else. Every once in a while is okay just not constantly. If you have it on anything else I recommend it there but not for the iPhone.
love it
If no update and continues to glitch I will cancel my subscription and delete app. Pandora is always A very plausible substitute.
I love this app so much yeah it has some flaws but honestly I love it more than anything!
It‚Äôs good but when a ad comes on it says 30 mins of ad free music but in reality it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs only like 10-15 mins!!
Gimme 3months free nd then I‚Äôll write a review
I can't like or dislike music without it login off the app it started after the last update plz help
Cool app
Please add a feature to select multiple songs at once, rather than clicking each song and adding each song individually to a playlist. (Mobile) I‚Äôm aware that the PC version you can select multiple songs.
Shuffle mode still not working. Uninstalled and reinstalled and still broken.   Please fix. 
I blast my coon tunes on spotify every day and its great!
I do not like the fact that things that should be a given are only for a premium feature. It makes the company seem greedy. I should be able to enjoy a full album without a featured artist interfering with it, and then I can‚Äôt even skip it if I don‚Äôt like it. That really upsets me. Ads are enough to buy premium but all of this extra annoyance just really makes me not ever want to use Spotify ever again.
This is App is so awesome!  I can listen to songs all day long!
Bad Bunny Baby
Better than Apple Music üëçüèº
It makes it so that I literally can‚Äôt listen to my music and say 30 minutes of no ads but gives me an ad afterward this is bad because I never have given less than a four star to an app
I love this app, I have no complaints about it and I love I can listen to all my favorite music. I only have one problem I‚Äôm trying to update to premium, but I have no idea how. It says I can‚Äôt update to premium through the app so how do I do it?
I listen to Spotify every morning walking my dog. It‚Äôs a good kick off to the day with a compilation of new and my favorite artists and styles. I pay for Premium so I have access to multitudes of music with no commercials!
Great app. Best thing I have bought.
All the ads are either FDA ads, the same two mind you, or it‚Äôs ‚Äúgriffin from hollister, Carpei now‚Äù
This app is better than Pandora and I was an Apple Music guy but I listen to my Spotify app more than anything now.
I can‚Äôt even listen to music cause every song that finishes it plays 5-8 ads, it‚Äôs to many in a short time. 1-3 is ok but not 5-8 that each individual ad is about 30 seconds to 1 minute long.
It sometimes forces you to listen certain songs even though you selected certain songs in a playlist, and you can only skip 6 of them. You can‚Äôt fast forward or go back in a song.
Me encanta esta aplicaci√≥n
I love Spotify but I don‚Äôt think there should be a limit for offline downloads for premium users
It allows you to play music almost anywhere. And it has ALL of my favorite songs when I use my phone I always listen to music from Spotify
The good thing is that it‚Äôs free and you have a variety of songs. it‚Äôs amazing.
The best
Thankyou spotify after  3 years never ever listened to any song on this iPhone. I finally got a chance to listen to my fav songs . Im so glad
This is seriously the only app I ever use for music and I've used it for years. But one annoying thing they've done in the midst of a ton of great changes is remove the "Downloaded" section. Which allowed me to see all of my downloaded music in one place. All I want is it for it to be back and this app would be perfect again
Love the great quality!!
‚ù§Ô∏è
I‚Äôm from iran Realy tanks 
so i‚Äôm laying in bed ya kno relaxing. i think i‚Äôm gunna be free of ads for awhile cause i just did the 30 min of ad free music ad thing, ya kno. so i‚Äôm laying there. 15 min later, i hear an ad. yes. an. ad. AFTER I SHOULDVE HAD 15 MORE MINUTES OF PEACEFUL LISTENING. but i like the app, free music great. just wanted to warn y‚Äôall that sometimes, that extra ad isn‚Äôt a good deal for ur time.
When I first got this app I loved it because it let me skip any song I wanted to for 7 days now it doesn't let me choose a song I want. Any time I try to play a song the shuffle button always shakes...so I have to listen to the song and when it's over I expect for the next song to play but it doesn't a song way before or way after plays. So then it says get premium but I have no idea how to get it!!!! Please improve your app Spotify!!!!üôè
This is the best music app I have ever usedüë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª
Only downfall is that you don't get to pick which songs to play next without premium and also limited skips
I love it so much and I can listen to all the songs I want
It‚Äôs an amazing app. There‚Äôs a reason a bunch of people use it and love it. I also love it. On iPads, tablets, computers, etc. you can (without premium) play any song with an occasional 30 second ad per 30 minutes. It‚Äôs worth it, and the sound quality with the actual song is good, too. It has basically, everything you need for music, and you don‚Äôt need premium to enjoy it, which I and surely many other people appreciate that. However, on the phone version, you must have premium to do almost everything, or else you‚Äôd have to shuffle play your song list and you can‚Äôt play specific songs on demand. Lots of other things, but it‚Äôs just not as free as the computer and tablet versions. It‚Äôd be great if you could modify it. But it‚Äôs fantastic, overall!
Amazing
New user. I like it so far.
This app b preetttyyy gud
Free Premium Pls!!!!
Love this app but I want more songs
Sometimes it freezes when a ad comes on but other than that I love the app
As a user I used to be able to edit and view my upcoming queue after adding songs to it. I can no longer do this.  For me, this was a huge competitive advantage over Apple Music when playing songs socially.  ‚ÄúAs a user I should be able to view and edit the upcoming queue‚Äù <- there‚Äôs the story guys, add that to your sprint. 
So personalized! My daily playlist is created by Spotify and changes everyday based on what the kind of music I listen to. It gets better and better! Love Spotify!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST MUSIC APPüòâI LOVE IT
This app is wonderful I‚Äôve had this app for over 4 years now I love finding new music and it‚Äôs a great way for you to really expand your music tastes if you don‚Äôt have this app you should definitely try it you won‚Äôt be disappointed!!!!!üòÅüëç
Every feature in the app is great. But, the preview music is no longer there. Is this due to a rights management issue?
BFF, Love you Spotify !
La mejor app para escuchar m√∫sica
All the advertisements have too much playlist on them.
Why do we need a subscription to listen to music individually without having to skip through 30000000000 songs to maybe get to the song u want to listenüôÑüòíüò©stop and just let us listen to our music normally
I personally think that the app is better on a computer because it doesn‚Äôt auto shuffle your playlists for you and say that unshuffling is a ‚Äúpremium feature ‚Äú. I mean that was a pretty dumb move they pulled doing that and I can‚Äôt even listen to one song or put a song in the queue. But if you are non premium user open a device that isn‚Äôt a phone then I would count as flipping FLAWLESS because none of those things I mentioned earlier come to play. And this is coming from a guy who uses it on his iPad, laptops, and Xbox. but for my experience with this app on an iPhone isn‚Äôt up to what I expected. :\
The commercials are absolutely obnoxious. I get they need to advertise and that‚Äôs fine. However it is a little over the top
I like this app but what if I want to listen to one song without stupid premium. I don‚Äôt have time to give ten dollars to this stupid thing once a month. Literally ...why does this exist
Spotify is so awesome because it has all the songs I need and I like to play on the bus so you to should download Spotify trust me you will love it !!!üòÉüòÅüòÄ
Epic
It will start to play my playlist, and then the next song to play will not be a song from my playlist. It plays songs I‚Äôve never heard before and don‚Äôt like.
I love it better than pandora
Yeah
Super acertada en los gustos
I am so so srry I wrote a bad review about Spotify charging me 70 dollars but thankfully it was a scam and I didn‚Äôt pay
Won‚Äôt let me log into the app. Doesn‚Äôt do anything when I press log in
I‚Äôve had issues in the past but it is always my go to music app.
I love the app Spotify! I love the playlist they make for you in the beginning!!!!! Bye it for FREE now..üëçüèº
Better than SoundCloud
When I go to play song I can‚Äôt even click on it I shuffle it doesn‚Äôt even play the song I want toüçÜüëãüèªüòÇ!
Really suggest paying for this! Great music app
Awesome
My Spotify was working perfectly fine last week, but when I signed out and signed back in my Spotify wouldn‚Äôt work. It won‚Äôt let me add songs, and it‚Äôs really bad. I want to know what happened?
Y York
It‚Äôs good
The app won‚Äôt let me listen to my music but it‚Äôs rlly good app
WOW THIS IS AMAAAAZING I CAN FINALY LISTEN TO MUSIC
I love listening to different types of songs I hate how u have to listen to other songs before getting to the song u want to listen to!
The best music app.
Please devoper-senpai, add to the watch
honestly can‚Äôt let me breathe w all these ads I feel like every 10 minutes it‚Äôs a new ad and im tried of it - really the only thing that makes this app unlikable
On the iPad it is ok, but on the iPhone, it is terrible. You can‚Äôt even listen to a certain song if you want to if you don‚Äôt get premium. You have to add it to a playlist first. And you can only shuffle play for playlists unless you get premium. You can‚Äôt even download any songs. And the premium is so expensive.
After signing up, I found the item I wanted, it went to Playlist but clicking on it took me to 'upgrade'--no way to access the artist/song. I don't need this frustion. Bye.
Great music streaming service; amazing song choices and suggestions, just need to add some more artists and it‚Äôll be perfect
I literally don‚Äôt know what my life would be without SPOTIFY.
I love it
Love this App .!!! It‚Äôs great . Can use on and offline :)
This app is amazing like on pandora and lets say that you pick panic at the disco it wouldn‚Äôt play that band it would play something LIKE it but not the real thing but with Spotify it plays your band.
Literally I pressed shuffle for all of my songs and then I realized I was listening to the same songs over and over. I have 2000 songs saved and I heard about 40 of them over and over. I was confused and thought it was just a random coincidence, then I started skipping songs quickly and I realized it was only playing songs from three different artists!? How could a company that makes such a good and successful music app that has redesigned mobile music have such a horrible shuffle play. Literally all the shuffle play should do is just pick random songs from all of my library, not recycle songs from imagination dragons, logic, and paramore over and over for hours when literally I have so many songs. I pay for premium and I don‚Äôt want to pay for something that has such a blatant flaw. I am very surprised because I love Spotify. I never close the app. But the shuffle play is absolutely awful. Please fix!
Great music app
ü§ûüèæüëåüèº will use forever
I have been hacked please find my music
I tried Pandora, but fell in love with Spotify‚Äôs playlist! I love their music collection and lists like Cardio, Work Out, Chill, Coffeehouse, as well as soundtracks and holiday playlists.   I also like the usability of Spotify and the UI. 
Very happy to have this app thank you very much
Because I can look up any music I want not like other apps.
I just wish that for the mix tapes when u press shuffle play and u don‚Äôt like the song it will let u change the song when u press shuffle play again
Spotify won‚Äôt let me scroll up and tap Playlists. I listen to playlists all the time and it wont let me pick it?!?
They give me the music I want. There's a couple songs I wanted to listen too but they didn't have it. Overall, they do a good justice. The playlists they make are also actually pretty enjoyable. Good enough app for me to make a review about it.
The only thing that is bad is I can‚Äôt pick a song that I won‚Äôt to listen from post Malone
I love spotify! Even though somethings could be improved, I think that app lives up to it‚Äôs standards and they have all of my favorite music.
I love spotify. Better than any other music streaming service.
Saves me so much money and time as a music lover
Nice app
Best music app I‚Äôve ever used. Totally worth it to upgrade to premium. Can‚Äôt live without it
Fsd
It's great
I love Spotify, I‚Äôve been a premium user for years, but I really really want Siri integration and an Apple Watch app.
Top
Can you like atleast make it available for the middle east? My rating will be 5 stars if you do that, thanks.
Ottima l'Integrazione con Sonos!
I love Spotify and subscribe. But their apps seem to have a problem deleting temporary files on Macs and IPads.  I finally ported my Spotify temp folder to a ram disk on my Mac so that it gets deleted every time I turn it off. On the iPad, alas.. I have to delete the app and then upload it again to clean out the temp files from memory (often over 1 Gig)..and no, I do not have the "download" button selected.
If you skipped to many songs it tells you to buy the Spotify Premium and there is only one button when it shows that and when I pressed  the button that does not say anything about buying it told me that I just bought Spotify Premium and I also did a 7 day trial but Overall it is an good music provider
Spotify is great for popular music but the selection is somewhat limited in other genres, but otherwise it‚Äôs perfect if your willing to listen to ads.
Spotify is very good with have all around music and some artists that people like that are not popular it has short adds and premium is very inexpensive  and on google home unlimited skips it would be better if you could chose 10 songs a day without having to shuffle a playlist and a button to like post a playlist and people can like it if they want and download it and share it with other people and it should have 1 button for marking playlists easy without shuffling a playlist not only for 10 to 20 minutes so making playlist easy and maybe that can post it kinda like my first suggestion Spotify is amazing I‚Äôd recommend it to every one 5 stars
Love it but wish we could use spotify make beats and record. Otherwise best music app.
I love this app so much it is the main reason I listen to music and you can customize playlists to what you want to hear!!
Awesome music player anyone should get it
Love it!
Loving the Spotify app and very grateful for the free trial for premium!! I love the fact that with Spotify I can go to my home screen and my tunes still play!!! Keep up the great work Spotify team! Thanks!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
It constantly plays ads, not even different ones just the same things over and over again, I DO NEED TO KNOW ABOUT KFC CHICKEN 3 TIMES OVER. Second it plays songs that you want then it‚Äôs just changes to songs you ‚Äúmight‚Äù like, if I wanted that I could play those songs I don‚Äôt need them to do it for me. And to download the music to your phone or whatever device you use you need ‚ÄúSpotify premium‚Äù which is just its cheap, generic way to ruin your music. This app is good for a lot of different kinds of music, from a lot of places and you can share your music but that‚Äôs pretty much it without ‚Äúpremium‚Äù.
This app is great however pretty much only if you have premium. They have changed the free version to where it is virtually impossible to listen to two songs you want back to back and it will just completely randomizes to songs that arent on your playlist and you cannot turn that feature off. Also you cant access your account from the app which is very annoying and you have to go to their website to make any changes at all even minor ones.This makes cancelling subscriptions unnecessarily difficult especially for the older audience who may not be able to understand how to use these products effectively. However i will admit even though its a little pricy premium is definitely worth it being able to stream all sorts of songs whenever. Although I still feel apple music its alternative is a better option with a much wider range of music and it being available the same day as release.
This is great just some more updates
üòõüòõüòõüòõüòõüòõüòõ
Most of my day involves music, from my mornings until I go to sleep. It frustrates me how you can really only enjoy the app with Premium, and I‚Äôm tired of it! With every update it adds new features, to premium of course, so we (the non-premium people) keep getting things taken away from us. Just because I don‚Äôt have $10 to waste a month, doesn‚Äôt mean I shouldn‚Äôt be able to enjoy music! Where is the old Spotify?
I've used Spotify for a long time but up until a couple weeks it won't open. Please fix.
Good to listen
At first there were barely any ads and they played every song you chose. Now they play your songs that you chose and a bunch of ‚Äúsuggestions‚Äù and there are like 2 ads every 4 songs....I think I‚Äôm about to go to Apple Music because it‚Äôs a lot better.
It is awesome!
‚ÄúSee All Albums‚Äù is now missing from some artists. Seems to be inconsistent.
Ë∂ÖÂ•ΩÁé©Â•ΩÊ≠åÂàÜ‰∫´
Literally rocks cuz that‚Äôs what I play. ROCK MUSIC. Get it?
Amazing
Ouu
I really like Spotify, but sometimes it crashes or it won‚Äôt let me listen to my music. Even if I‚Äôm on WiFi or Data
Love the whole system just wish more of it was free!
Absolutely the best
Best app
I love Spotify and use it almost everyday. However, recently I got a new phone and signed into my phone and all of my history was gone. By this I mean that all of my favorites and playlists, etc were gone. I‚Äôm very mad about this due to the fact that I have MANY playlists that are all very personalized and lengthy.
Its just so easy to find good/new music!
Functional and the support team is great however it doesn‚Äôt have some of the less mainstream songs
Everything about Spotify is great,is just about the premium.I don‚Äôt even know but most of all,I like Spotify and I think we should all should use it more often.
Great app... well used to be. There‚Äôs ads after every 3 songs. It says for me to watch a video to skip the next 30 minutes of ads, and then the app plays 2 right after. Also I‚Äôm listening to my playlist and it goes to random songs that are suggested. Please decline the ads and make the playlist only for the one selected.
Amazing app. Love it. But...I don't like that you have to pay to download music just to listen to music on offline. Please change that. Change it to where you can download it for free with wifi and listen to it without wifi. Like iTunes (for iPhones only) thanks. love ya!
Only thing I suggest is to make it compatible with smartinvert and offer apple watch capabilities.
You guys are the best !!!!!!
It‚Äôs a good App and all, but I don‚Äôt like the premium feature. But overall good
I don‚Äôt like this app because you can barely do anything without paying for the $12 premium. Can‚Äôt skip, can‚Äôt shuffle, can‚Äôt download. Dumb.
Took away my message inbox, can‚Äôt see who follows my playlists, and the recently played artists finally got better
I totally recommend this app. It works great on iPad iPod computer desktop and phone. I have premium for family and it‚Äôs totally worth it. I use it all the time and don‚Äôt have any issues whatsoever.
I think you need to filter the songs so kids won‚Äôt pick that language up
Hate Shuffle Songs without the premium
I hate everything about the update except how I get to chose any song talk about Snapchat 2.0
Has more obscure artist than other apps but the whole shuffle play and limited skips thing is stupid in 2018
Free music. Good selection
I like the music,but you should be able to hear the music of your playlist
I know that this app has a lot ( and I mean A LOT ) of ads. But did they have to put ads that cuss. Even worse, the ads are for Spotify premium. Fix that and I might just rate it 4 star because of the amount of ads.
App crashes after I love a song. No matter what song. It crashes. Please fix!
I LOVE THIS APP AND I JUST DOWNLOADED IT TODAY üíóüíìüíòüíûüíïüíôüíúüíõüíö‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏èüíù
SO MANY ADDS
I don‚Äôt like how you cant do anything in you don‚Äôt have WiFi. Also, in a playlist, when you play it, you can‚Äôt play the song that you want, it plays other songs or suggested songs. Also, there are no clean versions of songs. But the quality is good.
It rocks when you are signed in but if not it does not work as good
It‚Äôs a fun app, but I wish you had more skips, and could listen without WiFi without having to pay
This is a really great music app you should download it if you need an app to listen to music to
One of her better tracks
How the heck do i get premium?
This app is good, but you cant figure out how to play the song you WANT to play.
Great Solution for music lovers
Love it .  Make it so we can lessen any where for free plz  üêæüêæ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüëçüôÇüôÇüòäüê∫üê∫üê∂üê∂ 
Good music & listening is fun !!
Enjoying a playlist picked by Dhani Harrison for Starbuck‚Äôs in honor of what would be his father‚Äôs 75th birthday. George Harrison was such a great talent and a wonderful, humble person who is truly missed. I wish there was somewhere to buy a CD.
i absolutely love this app. now that i have my love for it stated, i must say im pretty disappointed/slightly annoyed that when my account missed my payment. i tried to pay it(and did) but my app still locked me out pretty much. i deleted the app and signed in again after re-downloading. but when i signed in, all my songs were deleted and my playlists looked like they did a year ago. very disappointed that ill have to try and build my music lists up again....
It‚Äôs a good app you can listen to a lot of different music so you should get it if you like music.
It won‚Äôt let me play a song it only lets me click shuffle play
It has Bts which made life so much better
If there was an app that would be nominated as a perfect example of the worst graceful degradation this would be it.
I pay for premium and I get to download playlist. Spotify why did you take away the area that showed all your downloaded playlist. It was so nice to have them grouped in one place for when I‚Äôm on the road and can‚Äôt look down at my phone to scroll through all my playlist to find the few I have downloaded. Please bring that back!
I just started listening to Spotify and so far it‚Äôs very enjoyable. Going back to oldies is such a wide variety that I as so surprising to me. The choices Spotify gives you and s great.
Best mothafucken app to use for music. Better then than pandora.
I love Spotify, and have been a Premium subscriber for years, but the most recent update turned on ‚ÄúDownload Over Cellular‚Äù which I‚Äôve never before used or had active, deleted my library from my phone, and proceeded to re-download everything, using a ton of data.
Better than other services.
I had this app for some time and I had no trouble with it at all. But recently it‚Äôs been telling me ‚ÄúSpotify is offline‚Äù I don‚Äôt know why I tried fixing it by deleting the app and reinstalled it but nothing seems to work:/  I‚Äôm paying monthly for errors. Can someone please help? Is there gonna be an update for this issue?
All you need
Lit app
I love it. It is my partner in my daily activities.
The whole concept of playing music and the likes is great. The thing that throws off the whole app is that you save a song on your personal playlist put it plays random other songs you may not even like. I understand the whole premium thing is ad free but having to pay in order to listen to the songs you want is wack.
I really do love Spotify! It‚Äôs a great music app and has a lot of popular songs to browse from, I just have some problems with some parts of the app. I really do hate that you have to BUY in order to click on a song and listen to that one song. It annoys me that I have to shuffle play all the time and hope to get the song I want to listen too. I also don‚Äôt like that you have a certain amount of skips and you can‚Äôt go back to a previous song. Everything else is fine, but it would be great if you could just let people who don‚Äôt want to or have premium have some more options.
Premium Is so worth it and I use the app every day everywhere I go! 
Love that they have the Richie Allen show
So sick of the app not responding, in one music session I have to shut down the app probably about 3-4 times maybe more because it just gets stuck? Very frustrating, been looking at which service to use instead of Spotify now unfortunately.
Spotify used to be an amazing service but now, it‚Äôs quality declined greatly. 1. The ads used to actually come up every thirty minutes, now they show up every 5 songs. 2. The recommended songs should stay recommended. While before the songs would just stay a the bottom of the screen in a little box, but now they just start playing in your playlist MORE than the actual songs on said playlist. On top of that you can‚Äôt skip them 3. On the topic of skipping, you only get a set number of skips, which on a free account makes sense, but as said before not when your phone is playing random songs 4. You can only play on shuffle, which would be excused but when you try to reshuffle it doesn‚Äôt change the song. When all is said and done Spotify is horrible unless you buy the premium version for 9.99 a month 
I love this app but a MAJOR DOWNSIDE is that you cannot are all your songs by the date they came out. When I want to know what songs were produced before 1989, I can‚Äôt do that. Please add a feature which allows me to sort songs by how old or new they really are.
Great selection of music. I listen to Spotify all the time :-)
It is not playing when I have full bar so I downloaded pandora instead and played pandora instead
Great
Love it
Spotify is amazing. I would recommend this app to you. The fact that you can get a lot of music that is legit not fake like Soundcloud, its amazing. On Soundcloud you would have to pay for some music if it wasn‚Äôt the one but on Spotify you get the right song, right lyrics, right EVERYTHING. The only downfall is that some music isn‚Äôt there but thats rareüôÇüëåüèΩüëçüèΩ
Review
Because the profile bar with the settings is covering it I can drag it down but it auto moves back up how am o suppose to play my playlists now? Fix it!
I love Spotify and the app runs so smooth and plays all my favorite music. I recommend the daily playlist it's fire
I love everything about it. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about it is Apple. Could Apple just delete their stupid Apple Music bs and use Spotify because everyone knows it doesn‚Äôt even come close to Spotify‚Äôs brilliance. Also, Apple recently gave Siri the ability to work with other apps besides the one that come with your phone and I would LOVE to be able to control Spotify with Siri. Not sure if that‚Äôs a ‚Äústill in development‚Äù thing or an Apple not liking Spotify thing.
I still listen to some of my Spotify but after Jay-Z became the co-owner of Tidal he removed all his music off of Spotify and put every single one of his albums on Tidal, so that made me switch to it. It's the same format/look as Spotify, just better sound quality and a lot more music. Even though I have Tidal, Spotify has been my favorite music app for years and still is.
The only thing I asked for you is you should be able to pick your own song out instead of having to listen to all the songs
Best music streaming app around!!  I have premium for my family.  One low price and up to 5 accounts.  Organization of your music is seamless on the app and can download for on the go too!  Love it so far! Every group, genre, and song available!!  No need to buy songs or albums ever again when you have access to every track ever created!
My Spotify is perfect for the google home we keep in the kitchen. I also have been using Apple Music for years, and don‚Äôt mind switching between them both. Spotify does offer a friendly user interface for selecting music based on moods, activities or sleep. Plus, I get a student discount which makes it more affordable.
I
La amo, es excelente aplicaci√≥n, por unos pesos q pagues tienes todo. Y lo vale!
Never had problems
I love the 30 min ad free for watching an ad. I love the Welcome Mix. It is the best.
Lightning McQueen here. Kachow
Helps a lot in whatever you are doing. You could do it for free.
Can yall bring back the ‚Äúdownload‚Äù section  so i can view only downloads. So much easier. If i download a album and go to albums. It shows all his old stuff from before. Atleast have everything downloaded showing first.
I love Spotify it is a great app And I enjoy it too 
I love the collections of songs and ease of use with my CarPlay.
I used to love this app, but now it doesn‚Äôt connect with my Sonos and will randomly skip songs or play random music not on my playlist. It‚Äôs extremely frustrating.
This app allows me to save the music to my device. This is an awesome feature when I‚Äôm out in a non coverage area. This app is awesome.
Thanks for the ability to listen to such great music all day long!
It is a good app
Really enjoying discovering new tunes, but also reliving the past with old songs long forgotten!!
It is great all around in the fact that it shows me songs that I might like which often times I do and the fact that there are so many song choices easy to find but the only thing is, is that you can‚Äôt change your username which is helpful if you made your account years ago and want to change it to your style now.
Love that I can find all the different songs easily that allows me to create playlists which reflect my mood.  I am an old man and this new (sorta of) technology challenges me. I wish once you create a play list you could review the song titles.   None the less, love the app. 
I‚Äôve waited on multiple updates to fix this problem. The app will just stop playing randomly at the beginning of the next song in a playlist. This even happens if I have the playlist downloaded on my phone, so I know it‚Äôs not a buffering issue. I need this app to run uninterrupted for more than 15mins at a time. I‚Äôm going to cancel my membership if this isn‚Äôt fixed. I‚Äôve waited long enough. The app should automatically go to the next song in the queue if the one currently playing has an error. It makes common sense!
GET IT!!! It‚Äôs an amazing app. I use it everyday. Don‚Äôt think about just get it. Thank you Spotify. The only thing I want is premium but it‚Äôs kinda hard to get it when u don‚Äôt hav money. But it‚Äôs an awesome app. I LOVE IT!!!
Great range if music
Interface is super!
Very easy to use and has a wide variety of music, they have had every song I have looked up
Yes please remove all ads pleaaaase
I‚Äôve been using Premium for like 3+ years. I use this app every single day. I just WISH we could get a ‚Äúno explicit songs‚Äù kind of block option. Some radio/music apps have it but Spotify definitely hasn‚Äôt caught on. For every song I find that‚Äôs explicit I have to search the song or search the artist or both if it‚Äôs super stubborn and just hope I find a version by the artist that‚Äôs clean. It‚Äôd be so much easier if Spotify made this a lot easier by making it easier to find clean versions. Especially when the artist already have clean/radio versions, but they‚Äôre just not on the app.
It‚Äôs feel so close to the musical world.
It says watch an ad for 30 mins of free music then it goes through 2 songs and plays like 5 more ads then another 2 songs and more ad like you money hungry sluts
Honestly, I love this app. It‚Äôs great to use when you‚Äôre on the road and stuff. I highly recommend it.
I love Spotify. All the type of songs that I love was put in a category called "Fresh and Chill" theres not one song that I don't like and I've haven't heard most of those songs.
Well, it is a very useful and good app. It lets you listen to music for free or if you have premium. But one, premium costs a lot of money. If you don‚Äôt have premium, you don‚Äôt have unlimited skips, or you need connection to listen. That dress bed me crazy. Fix this.  And the premium price. Overall, very good app.
I love it but I don‚Äôt like the skip thing I wish u didn‚Äôt have to do the premium to do that but what Ev good app
I have the app on my iphone. But why does Spotify not sync with my apple watch?
I think it blocked from Kuwait and Middle East !!
Have a music taste that ranges from Cannibal Corpse to Sir Elton John? Spotify is for you.
Gaia
It is a great music player app. It has music for all tastes. I used to use iheart radio and sometimes still do, but I think this is a better choice.5 stars
You can‚Äôt just listen to any song you want. It makes you listen to suggested songs, you can‚Äôt skip songs, and the suggested songs have nothing to do with your music! It is annoying unless you get premium.
I don't know I've been using a bunch of music apps so far but Spotify is the best.The only few things I'd like to see in the future is a download button along the other features on the home page.Sometimes people who are running on low battery 'cause of the excessive used they've made of their cell may not want to turn on their data and listen to a music of their choice.As a result,it's a good music app with the best sound worldwide and the updates are undoubtedly unquestionable.
THIS IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST EXPERIENCE YOU CAN HAVE ON A STREAMING SERVICE
I hate the adds
I cant even purchase premium. So why tease me about it
So cool that Autumn Calabrese created playlists to accompany the 80DO workouts! Keep it up Beachbody!
I love that I can save my favorite songs under a unique playlist and how intuitive it is in selecting songs similar to the playlist.
Add widget. Plain and simple.
I absolutely adore this app. With unlimited access to millions of free songs by my favorite artist, you can imagine my satisfactory üòÇ. Tho I‚Äôm still waiting for the lemonade album to be uploaded üëëüêù
I love this app so much you can play your games while hearing your music and there is only a little bit of adds.  Who ever made this app 5 complete star.üòÅüòÑüòÉüòÄ 
I miss being able to press and hold to preview a song. Algorithm is biased to only playing a few popular songs when listening to self made playlists.
pretty good until you use up the free 7 daysüòÇüòÇüòÇ
No joke! Best app ever! You washing clothes? You walking your dog? You in the grocery line? If you ain‚Äôt on Spotify you‚Äôre missing out hard..
I love it all!!
Why can‚Äôt we pick songs!?!
I love this app it is the best app for my music but what would be nice is if you add a Apple Watch app.
Take it from me, Jb gunshot. Only listen to real sniiga anthems with this app.
Spotify used to be good, but now I can never hear any of the music from my playlist only recommended songs. That‚Äôs so annoying!
And Spotify knows this.  Yeah, since sliced bread......
Very good music! Keep up the good work! :)
Me encanta s√∫per f√°cil de usar
It is the best music app ever
I LOVE IT BEACAUSE I CAN
Spotify is the best, that‚Äôs all.
I love this app i can finally listen to all my favorite songs while I'm looking at a different app or when my phone is off. It‚Äôs a little annoying with the ads but other than that its amazing
I‚Äôm looking for a new app. Hopefully someone will make something better. Spotify used to be good.
Best around!!
I love you
Gs
Still not user friendly just yet, learning the access !
I accidentally liked a song from the an artist radio in the app and won‚Äôt let unlike it. It‚Äôs stays thumbed up and plays it constantly on the station. Pandora would let me unlike songs if I didn‚Äôt like it anymore.
I'm not liking the new update. I like to be able to go through my playlist & choose to listen to whatever song I want to, now I can't. And with the free account, you're only allowed a certain amount of skips. I'd rather listen to iHeart radio if that's the case. I honestly used to love Spotify, but now? It's about to be a no for me which I kind of upsetting
This is the most greatest app of all time it has all my favorite artists.$$$$$ü§ëü§ëüëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩ
I love the songs
Since the latest update, the app crashes more often, or freezes and won't open at all. Also, I can't view my downloaded music anymore. Pretty lame. The only way I can view downloads is if I save them to a playlist.   Could you change it back, Spotify? Thanks. 
I honestly love this app I use it all the time and it‚Äôs an amazing way to listen to music while doing something on ur phone!!
I found my self buying premium because everything is better with premium üòâ
Liking or disliking a song crashes the app now.
Ahhh yesssssssss, that‚Äôs the stuff.
Excellent music choice
This app is great in that you get free songs, but the app won't even let you listen to your own songs unless you buy Premium. For $10/month. When you listen to one of your playlists, they will keep playing "suggested tracks" instead of YOUR songs that you want to listen to!!! And it's not like they let you skip the songs, you can only skip 6 songs per hour. Premium costs way too much, and it would be cheaper to buy the songs on iTunes or something. Would be a great app if it wasn't for Spotify Premium.
Should be free
Allow basic ability like: skips, and shuffle all
Heck ya.
Spotify‚Äôs latest BS is the video backgrounds on random songs. They can‚Äôt be turned off, and they cause the playback controls to disappear after a few seconds. I don‚Äôt care if you want to add stupid new features like this - just let me turn them off!
I loved this app. It was my go-to music app. But, one time this app posted my top Spotify artists, and 4 of them weren‚Äôt even people I‚Äôve ever listened to! The only reason I‚Äôm complaining is because I‚Äôm a teacher and my top Spotify artists were those who have curse in their music!  This is ‚ÄúAPPsolutely‚Äù outrageous! We should be able to pick, choose and edit our top Spotify artists. I won‚Äôt be redownloading this until the issue is fixed.  -Sincerely, me + hundreds of your customers that you ignore. 
I so luv this app...
Their is nothing wrong with the app. It is amazing.
I love this app very much but I think a few improvements could be made. I listen to multiple genres of music and I think if you added a section to just shuffle a certain genre would be cool. I know there is the option of making a playlist but that takes a lot of time and I‚Äôm not a fan of playlists. If that was a thing I think it would be very cool.
i feel like y‚Äôall shouldn‚Äôt make it like pandora as to where you can only skip a few times at once & i think that when i click on a specific song, it should play instead just pressing the shuffle button. please fix this, i like this app.
Latest updates have removed the "downloaded" music section, which is now hidden behind several items and filters.   In general, the app is much less intuitive since these design choices make a basic, everyday function somewhat of a chore to access. These design decisions make me more skeptical of Spotify as a service and as a result, I feel less invested in its ecosystem. 
Awesome!
Love it. I listen while I weld helps me focus.
I‚Äôm new to Spotify - I really LOVE it.  Good songs, lots of metal bands, both new and old.
It‚Äôs good just wish you can listen to music offlineüôå but other then that‚Äôs it‚Äôs really greatüòÅ
Why?!? Just why did you remove the function of tap-and-hold to preview a song/artist?!!? This was one of the best UI functions in any music app I‚Äôve ever used. The ability to tap-and-hold on the image of an artist (or specific song) and have a selection of songs to preview was amazing; it‚Äôs the way I‚Äôve discovered so much new music. But it was removed!! Now you have to actually select a track to hear it, and if you already have a song playing you now have to go back to it. It just makes ‚Äútrying out‚Äù or previewing new music so much more clunky. Please bring back this function. Surfing through related artists is so much more painful now than it used to be....
La mejor App que pueda existir para escuchar m√∫sica!
Frustrated that I can‚Äôt download the clean version of some of my favorite radio songs!  My Apple Music offered them without a problem.
Perfect 10/10
would be nice if you could choose which song to listen to without premium
smooth interface with any song I wanna listen to just a search and play button away!
Estou adorando ouvir musica enquanto trabalho!
It will not let me me skip or replay the song
Buen√≠simo
I like the dark theme so much that  can‚Äôt use Apple Music and google play music. I just wish there‚Äôs an option to turn off lyrics , it‚Äôs really annoying
What real point do non-premium users have to use this app? It will literally play 3-4 of the songs from your playlist then play about a dozen suggested songs that I often don‚Äôt even like. The only reason it‚Äôs a 2/5 and not a 1/5 is because it doesn‚Äôt have many bugs or glitches, but otherwise it‚Äôs pretty stupid and crummy because the way they treat there non-premium users.
This is my only complaint about the entire app but it still ruins the experience. I have gone many times where I‚Äôll have one of the songs actually in my playlist followed by 6/7 suggested tracks that I don‚Äôt want to listen to. Do you guys want to make a playlist and only be able to listen to songs that rent in the playlist? I know I don‚Äôt. So if you could please reduced the rate of suggested songs it would make the app so much better.
Love it!! My son had it then I tried it now I'm hooked!
The best
Perfec
It would be nice to keep listening to all my music without having to remove old albums just to make space for more songs. There needs to be an increase to this, or I will be switching to Apple Music.
Music that follows me everywhere, when is neededü§™
A friend finally convinced me to try this over using YouTube and Pandora and when I finally did I bought it was pretty good and then came in the customized playlists they put together for you based on your searches and man it‚Äôs on point! Love it!
One of the best music on the market, the 30 min non commercial music is awesome... 100% recommend it for all music lovers...üëçüèªüëçüèª
To many ads
I like the app, but songs play that aren‚Äôt on my playlist play with auto play off.
One of the greatest enjoyments of my life prior to Spotify was listening to all my music library on true shuffle: a shuffle that sorts out the library in a COMPLETELY random order, not with an algorithm that sorts out things based on what I have been listening to lately.  There is no shuffle on Spotify, and it would be the perfect improvement. Please include a totally random shuffle option.   If I wanted to listen to everything I‚Äôve been listening to lately, I would play ‚ÄúRecently Added‚Äù or ‚ÄúRecently Played‚Äù. 
Dope app..would definitely recommend
I mean don‚Äôt get me wrong. It‚Äôs a great app. Only if you have money for premium. Now I have only been upswing this app for 2 weeks. But, when I first started it up it immediately said, ‚Äútry premium!‚Äù So me getting a chance to try the wonder of premium I did it. Everything was perfect. Offline, could pick any music I wanted. But the joy only last for 7 Days.   7 Days later.   ‚ÄúYour premium has ended!‚Äù Okay shouldn‚Äôt be that bad. Shouldn‚Äôt! I get picked up from my mom and I try playing music. What! You can‚Äôt play anything your offline! Turing online. You can‚Äôt pick a specific song? ‚ÄúShuffle play‚Äù Okay! Let‚Äôs use an example of Panic! At the disco. BOOM! Some other song by another band that I don‚Äôt know. What! It this! I have to skip! Skips over. ...! Well I guess we have to listen to nothing.   Yeah that was different. Not what I thought would happen. Really starting to dislike this app. Please improve. 
Can‚Äôt get enough
GIMME DA MUZAK!!!!!
Ur mom gay lol
So i gave Pandora literally 2 years to own up to its name, but then i tried Pandora and got obsessed within the day. With their awesome selection of BTS music and all, and the ability to make your own albums to how you feel, its amazing! @bagtan‚ù£Ô∏èlover (*innocent plug)
Well both of my children use this so I thought I would give it a second try.  I was very impressed with the improvements, and before anyone asks which ones? I have no idea specifically, but so much so I am using it now where as before I deleted itüòÄ.  It could be as simple as music selection, or ease of use, either way I enjoy it now and that is what matters.
I have gone through a few music apps cause I am all for music.And I have finally found one where I can play the music that I want when I want it. Pandora is good but it doesn‚Äôt really play the music I want but on Spotify I can listen TO WHAT I WANT !!!!!! So stop wasting time on other apps and try Spotify and btw there r a little ads so that one of the best parts!!! So get it u will prob not regret it!!!!!!!!üëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüòÅüòÅüòÉüòç
AWESOME
idk what‚Äôs happening with my shuffle feature, but it‚Äôs not working. whenever i try to press shuffle on all of my saved songs (i have like 1100-?1200) the upcoming songs are literally just the letters a, b, and numbers. i don‚Äôt understand why, but that‚Äôs definitely not shuffled when there should be 23 other letters mixed in. besides that the app cool, but this shuffle thing is annoying af
OMG the best I can‚Äôt get enough of it it gives you thousands of choices of songs or even more I just love it!
I was on a family plan and after the update I was kicked off and can‚Äôt join back. Thanks a lot Spotify.
Pretty upset you can‚Äôt change your username. I made this account years ago and made a totally stupid username and that‚Äôs how everyone will see it ):
I do not like the suggested songs & hate the adds. They should make the free version exactly like the premium. No adds unlimited skips . Not everyone has $100 a month to spend especially if on a fixed income.
It‚Äôs good and really fun
I can finally listen to meme music
I like it
You guys suddenly removed all of Uhmm Kulthum‚Äôs albums. I used to enjoy listening to her after work and sometimes while studying. I need an explanation. Other than that I love using Spotify!
This app worked for the first few days I tried playing a playlist and it wouldn't let me do anything
I would have given 5 stars if... There was an option to undo a "thumbs up" for songs on a radio station. Whether I accidentally gave it a thumbs up, or it'd I'm sick of hearing a song, there's no way for me to undo the thumbs up.
Amazing... just amazing
Spotify is bad don‚Äôt download it phones it doesn‚Äôt play the music you want or songs that even relate to your favorite music and if you try to change it it says buy premium 9.99 a month on computer it‚Äôs great but not for phone so just forget about bull$h!t Spotify on phones
Best music app there is!!!
Good lord, drop that stupid Shell ad. Crashes the app.
You guys should play it has the best music I love it I whould play this all day üëäüèªüëäüèªüëäüèªüëäüèª‚úåüèª‚úåüèª‚úåüèª‚úåüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª

Beast
Love the app and like how you can have a radio for a playlist you‚Äôve made so 5/5‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
It‚Äôs so stupid that we have to press shuffle on playlists instead of choosing the song we want. Anything for money.
It‚Äôs really helpful to get all the songs you like and get your stress away by hearing your favorite songsüëå
I have used this app for about a week and it‚Äôs AMAZING!!! I love it sm.!
It keeps on bugging me about premium and won‚Äôt even let me start my playlist again until I watch an Ad
Good selection and free
Spotify we need more then 10 spaces In the search history. Earlier versions had much lore. Fix this please. Great App. 
Hi I am a user of your app Spotify and I would like to report I have a problem with your app. The problem is when I play my music and one of the my songs on my list is over it switches to a song that isn‚Äôt even in my playlist at first it was only one song and then today when I was listening to my music it kept on playing more songs that weren‚Äôt on my playlist.
Great to find new artists
There are great songs
M Its the best app!! I use it every day!! 
Love it!!! And I don‚Äôt have premium
Love the availability of mainstream and underground artists
That‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs missing. And it‚Äôs glaring.
So I actually paid for premium, and I only got about 3 days of free membership before the whole app crashed and it decided to say, ‚ÄúThis item,‚Äù (premium membership), ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt be purchased on this app.‚Äù   It gets me the music very easily, and it‚Äôs great, but for some reason, I can‚Äôt listen to it or skip the songs I don‚Äôt want to- premium can‚Äôt even be paid for on this device- I‚Äôm using my phone. And recently, I had to get a new one, because my old one shattered and the chips and everything were revealed, and everything was glitched. And even with the new phone, it‚Äôs still incapable :/ 
Music changes your perspective of something. Sometimes I listen to pump music then some slow ones. And yes it cost money for premium. However, we need to recognize that Spotify has to pay singers for free music. And premium just benefits everyone. We get listen to the songs we love and Spotify can pay the hardworking singers. And no I am not paid for a review. I happen to use music to get me into moods.
Thanks! Enjoying the app!
I remember when Spotify was low key and they didn't flood me with ads
Pls change it back!!!  We know what podcast we‚Äôre listening to so why make it clunkier on my iPhone w BIGGER icons?!?  And only enough txt to clutter// if we want/need to review the ep deets we know how to click on the 3-dots.    You‚Äôre just lucky the iOS podcasts app is worse and I‚Äôm a Spotify subscriber that would have to re-activate my fb account to do anything w my Spotify acct.  (Also a HUGE annoying *quirk* of Spotify and if they had warned me when signing up I wouldn‚Äôt have been lazy and just clicked signup w FB!)  End rant(s). 
1 star because you got rid of the Downloads folder. It was the whole reason I went with Spotify over SoundCloud Go.
Easy to use, great quality, great app.
Really. How cool.
I use it all the time and love Spotify!
They give you limited number of skips and so that is why.
I love Spotify and think that it is one of the best music providers out there. But unfortunately there are just a few problems that need to be fixed.
Music and my demand what else would you want
Love Spotify
10/10
You pretty much get to choose to listen to any song you want whenever you want- which I guess you can't really top!
Do you want to cater to the under 8 year old market?   Apparently not  #5YearsAndCounting 
It's Gucci
Great music app #1
I‚Äôm enjoying the app, great for playlists and finding new music.
This app used to be great but now it keeps pausing my music and skipping forwards and backwards and skipping songs without me pressing anything. This is very annoying and I wish Spotify would fix this issue.
Awesome üòé Brilliant KlassySexyKool
I like a this app
Lo recomiendo mucho. Todo tipo de m√∫sica, un repertorio interminable y mucho para descubrir.
There should be easier ways of sorting music on phones. On the computer there is the option of ascending vs descending order, that should also be available on the phone. Scrolling through 1000 songs to reach the most latest song on the playlist is a tedious task to do all the time
I started a station and then an ad played. When the ad finished and it returned to the music, the app started skipping the next 5 songs or however many it is by itself!
I really enjoy Spotify.  But, I hate that the back button is located on the top left. Keep all the navigation at the bottom. Right next to my thumb...
Love that the new update shows more clearly if I have listened to a podcast. It even has a progress bar now and the summaries on the main page! Thanks guys!
I absolutely love being able to make my playlists and for the suggestions Spotify makes for me!!
I love Spotify, as long as you have WiFi you can listen to your favorite tunes whenever and wherever you go!
Best $$ I‚Äôve ever spent.
I used to absolutely love Spotify back in 2013. Now, though, the ads take over the music and when I shuffle play my own playlists or artist playlists of Alternative or Rock, the most recent and popular pop music plays in between with a good 20 songs. If I switch to another playlist it works okay again but if I go back to my previous playlist after a while it still plays the pop music right where it left off.
I love this app so much it‚Äôs a must have !!!! I really recommend it
I LOVED Spotify. I even have the family package for the rest of my family because i loved it so much, but now i can barely use it. I can only listen to about a minute of a song before it skips to the next one or skips to some random playlist like top Poland songs or an album I‚Äôve never heard of. I‚Äôve tried closing the app, uninstalling. Nothing helps. I‚Äôve resorted to getting an Apple Music subscription because nothing is more annoying than being in the gym and songs are skipping all over the place.
I love it!!!!
good lol ‡∞ú‡±ç‡∞û‚Äå‡∞æ
Just switched from Pandora to Spotify and I'm never looking back now. $3 less per month subscription, the free version has less annoying ads, and you can choose songs to play as you please. I can't believe how much this has improved since it was first created!
I‚Äôve used Spotify for years. I always listen to the ad to get 30 minuets of add free listening and I only get about 10 minuets ad free. I‚Äôm mad and they really need to fix it
Songs that are not in my playlist are playing. When I try to play songs that I have saved or are in a playlist they don‚Äôt play. üò†
I don't want a radio I want individual songs because I went to play a song and it pulled up a different song.
It streams music, that's basically the only good thing about this app. The ads are constant. Switching to another song causes ads to play even if you've watched some to get "Thirty Minutes of Ad Free Music." I was fine with it at first, but now that it occasionally forces me to watch a minute and thirty seconds of an ad instead of the usual fifteen or thirty seconds, I am no longer fine with it. This app is mediocre at best, it's just going to force you to pay for premium until it drives you insane.
I love it, but it has been doing weird things lately. I have blue tooth in my truck and it plays fine, but I noticed that if my phone screen locks or I move to another app it will stop playing. I DON‚ÄôT LIKE THAT! Please fix it!
I like music -_-
The app is great it‚Äôs good for listening to when you are bored. Especially when you are not doing house chores, listen to Spotify!
Great app
I understand having ads, but whats the purpose of suggested tracks?! I wanted to listen to a jpop album and a track suggested rap? The album is not even remotely like the song that was suggested. I want to listen to the music I want to hear not what the app wants me to.
For a few days it‚Äôs been skipping a few songs without me touching anything, it‚Äôll pause randomly and it used to be nice, but then all the other stuff started happening. These glitches are not fun at all
I like the app but there‚Äôs a lot of stuff you can‚Äôt do if you don‚Äôt have premium.
The new discord integration is A LIE! It is not a music bot, it's basically paying for a "music" status bar.  if you only have one friend with premium it's useless. Most of my friends don't use Spotify, let alone pay for premium. I love Spotify a lot but there should be a ton on noncopyright playlists that everyone can listen to together. This doesn't feel like sharing music, this feeling like a money grab and it makes me very sad. 
Pleas help me
Music simply changes everything...
if theres a setting to turn off automatic showing of behind the lyrics, why not make an option to disable this feature overall? i love genius but not when it‚Äôs forced upon me to the point that the gesture of swiping past songs (or pulling the album art down to get out of the ‚Äònow playing‚Äô screen) is blocked by this little animation showing that i can use the genius feature, so frustrating. also, what happened to the list of playlists not needing internet to load? even though most of my playlists are saved for offline i‚Äôm not able to even able to view them in areas of poor connection like my elevator when i‚Äôm ready to start playing music to take on the day. i‚Äôve never had such issues in the older versions of spotify, if it ain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt ‚Äòfix‚Äô it.
Love this app.
This is ok
Please make this app function in Romania,i can‚Äôt make an account because i‚Äôm in my country. :(  In other Eu country is working.(not all,but still) 
This app has been solid, but my most concerning issue is the genre sections for music. Apple Music will provide a ton of artists on their genre pages and I can quickly browse and listen to popular and less popular artists. Spotify on the other hand will only place well known artists in their genre section, especially for Hip-Hop/Rap. Adding support for less known artists would help. Due to this issue, I will start using iTunes to find music. If this doesn‚Äôt change over time I‚Äôll eventually switch to Apple Music. It‚Äôs nice to have more options to quickly browse through. New releases from less known artists will go unnoticed due to this problem, which I find frustrating.   Thanks for reading! 
Spotify got me rocking 24hours
I‚Äôve had Spotify premium for maybe 5 years, and I‚Äôve tried to listen to a new album every day. Other music apps don‚Äôt give you the freedom or accessibility that Spotify does
Why in God's Earth does the search function suddenly disappear all of a sudden after i use it for even just a little while?? It's so frustrating, cause I'm listening to music, and then, BOOM! The search bar/function is gone! It's frustrating cause I have to restart the d--n app over, therefore the music currently playing stops too! What gives???
Doesn't matter how I feel when ever I turn it on,it does the job,truly it is the best music app
That is so sad.  How do people use such a funny app?
I don‚Äôt like shuffle when you want to hear one band a it keep playing ones you dont‚ùóÔ∏è
Coo app
By far the best steaming platform! I love it so much, especially the offline mode for premium members because so I don‚Äôt have to use my cellular data! It almost has every song ever made. I always recommend to friends when they talk about other streaming apps. Spotify is 10/10!
After not being on in a while it kicked me out and says my account is not found. Worst app ive ever downloaded
Who needs an iPod when you have all this Spotify?
It‚Äôs a great app tbh I don‚Äôt have the premium version but it‚Äôs still enjoyableü§óü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
In my opinion Spotify is the best music app ever
Panic at the disco fall out boy twenty one pilots are all awsome songs
It‚Äôs worth the $
Very good
Its the best music app ever it will play the songs I'm in the mood for i love it!
Jdjfjfjfjfkfn
Tons of songs in my playlist yet plays the same ten songs over and over and over. Pretty much stopped using it at this point.
I love Spotify because I can play any music I want. I wish the same could be for my phone though...
Missing the preview option where you just hover over albums. Voice recognition only worked for a short period of time.
It‚Äôs ok I just wish that when your playing your playlist Spotify wouldn‚Äôt all of a sudden switch the song so something that you don‚Äôt even have on your playlist
I tried Spotify tonight for the first time. I spent 45 minutes picking my music. I could‚Äôve kept going. So fun! It‚Äôs ‚ÄúSPOT‚Äù on!!
Awesome af
Recomendada
Use it all day long, best music app I have used by far.
This is a excellent app to use when listening to your music ‚ò∫Ô∏èüë∫
I used to LOVE this app and use it all the time, but now it so much worse. I wanted to listen to music from a movie I love, so I made a playlist of all of the songs from that movie(12 songs). It played TWO of my songs and then it just started playing random ones that weren‚Äôt in my playlist! You can‚Äôt skip either, you need the premium version. Not worth it at all.
Great app just make sure to buy premium in the beginning of the year
Stop eating all of my phone memory when I have no downloading! I have to uninstall/reinstall almost every week. I really need to switch to some other service. 
Love this app get no WiFi needed Just love for music
I plays music not on my playlist and I have to pay for premium in order for that to not happen
I love it tells you if a song has bad words and I can listen to all my favorite music and songs thanks for this app!!!
I need help and i can‚Äôt remember my email
I love Spotify but it does not let you skip song after you have already skipped about 10, and how you can‚Äôt listen to a specific song without shuffling the songs. But other than that I love Spotify it is awesome!
Cmon guys
I just want an app where I can just listen to music without having to pay for it... Other than that This app is great and I‚Äôve never seen anything like it. 
Spotify is my FAVORITE music app but I think its annoying that you can't change a playlist cover and description from inside the app. I have to pull out my old laptop, wait for it to turn on, then wait for the spotify app to open up and its SO ANNOYING!! It'd be so much easier if the feature was in the app.
Love listening to artists like Chance the rapper ski mask the slump,franceauthagod ,pouya ,fat nick
Every other song 2-4 commercials come on. Drives me crazy. Love the channels but if they can play maybe one commercial per 5 songs instead of the 4-1 ratio, that‚Äôd be nice. Yes, I know maybe pay for the ads to go away but I don‚Äôt want too ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
EXXXCELLENT!!!
Tends to skip song often, you will need to delete the app and uploaded again, maybe 4 times in a single night
it is okay but it won‚Äôt let me play whatever song I want
I have used Spotify for quite some time now and thoroughly enjoy it. But my only complaint is the removal of the song preview feature. With this feature you would be able to hold the 3 dots next to the title and hear a preview of the song. This is a great feature if you are trying to find a specific song OR if you are interested in finding new music. SINCE this feature has been removed I will only be able to rate Spotify at 3 stars.  If Spotify is willing to bring back this feature then I will be more then happy to rate them 5 stars. But for now it will stay at 3. Please bring back this feature.
Crashes nonstop for past few weeks, has forced me to use SoundCloud. Please fix!
We should have unlimited skips even without premium
I think that it should be cellular.
If you don't have premium then you always have to shuffle play and theres long ads. What if I want to hear a song before I add it to my playlist.
As of the last update the app keeps crashing and prompting me to try again.
This is the best place to find just about everything in music. I love the study music and focus. From time to time I hit up the coffee place and if I‚Äôm feeling adventurous I‚Äôll stop by and listen to new artists who love to share their music here. Jon Bellion is one of my new favorite ones. Thank you Spotify.
It's the best app  everything about it if the commercials were off that would be cool to just go through the song And if you hold onto the name of the song to check what the song sounds like if we didn't hear it before that would be great to check out the songs on the app
Feliz encantada de la vida
This app is amazing! I can listen to all my songs for free! Also offline
Could use some add just mention
You name it. Spotify has it. To get the full experience I suggest to get premium but it isn‚Äôt necessary. I know that in other reviews people say ‚Äúa bunch of other songs I didn‚Äôt ask to listen too‚Äù or whatever, but really the app couldn‚Äôt be alive if it didn‚Äôt have a reason for people to get premium. Think in the developers point of view! Try and understand they can‚Äôt make it all free. But what I can say for sure, is that PREMIUM IS WORTH IT! There‚Äôs no better music app in my opinion. Happy listening!‚ò∫Ô∏è
This is the best music app. It gives you free music I have no complaints You don't even have to pay for any music it's so good and you must get this 
Stop trying to get people to pay for unlimited skips and no adds. It‚Äôs annoying, stop being about money and let us just enjoy music. Don‚Äôt you make enough money from people just downloading and having the app??
This app was great up until a few updates ago. I‚Äôve held off on posting because I was hoping that te next update or the next would fix the problem I‚Äôm having. Almost every time I pause my music for more than a couple minutes, it‚Äôs like the app refreshes itself. I can hit the play/pause button all day and it won‚Äôt do anything. I have to physically go into the app and restart the music. It‚Äôs becoming very frustrating to have to go into the app almost every time I pause my music.
We love Spotify Family Premium! but how easy would it be to add some basic parental controls? Please add!
Very good
The sound and quality is amazing, Although the son selection needs to be a bit broader. iTunes has remixes and some more under ground music that Spotify doesn‚Äôt.
Very cool
This is the best music app up can get
Used to take advantage of the space better but now is the same as the iPhone app, just stretched out. Why did y‚Äôall do this? Only thing I can think of is to cut development costs, which is a little sad.   Also please update the screenshots on iPad to represent the changes you guys made. It‚Äôs false advertising showing the more advanced, superior design that used to exist. 
Check out my SoundCloud üîì
Greatness 24/7.
I really hate shuffle play because most of the time it plays music not related to the album I‚Äôm listening to on shuffle play. I had to come back and reduce my rating to one star because as soon as I went back into Spotify, the app proceeded to play 5 songs unrelated to what I was listening to. I wasted all my skips on mainstream garbage that they were trying to force me to listen to.
This is by far the best music app‚ÄºÔ∏è
Could you please make a watch app feature?  I would love it!!! 
Best music app
It‚Äôs gotten more difficult than it should be to manage your library, specifically the downloaded content to listen offline.  Once you‚Äôve downloaded an album, even if you later toggle off it from your library, it counts towards your max songs of 9999.  The only way to edit that 9999 list is to go one at a time and delete each song.  There is no clear cache button and useful info is hard to come by.
If you would add a way to mix multiple stations together (like the station shuffle on Pandora) then I would never need Pandora again. I love Spotify. I'm only giving Spotify 4 stars because I still have to use Pandora. I hate Pandora and I don't want to to use it, but I like that feature. Add the feature so I can finally get rid of Pandora.
Love it so much
I can‚Äôt even listen to a single song on my playlists because it gives me suggested tracks. It is really annoying especially when artists release songs that are  Spotify exclusive and I can‚Äôt even listen to them because it won‚Äôt play them. All it plays is songs that are suggested and every time you skip it, it just goes to another suggested track until you are out of skips. It is very very frustrating and not even worth having the app.
press an hold to sample a song is gone because of updates,,, bring it back
Been meaning to get on here for a while and finally did it last night & committed to the premium subscription. Great service, keep up the great work!
I need help!!! I‚Äôve had Spotify for some time now and I wanna upgrade to premium but I don‚Äôt see an option.. please help
I love this app but when ever I get a snapchat the music stops and it get REALLY ANNOYING.
I just want to take a moment and appreciate the development
Could make it more understandable and I can‚Äôt restart my songs and I‚Äôm using some free trial so I wouldn‚Äôt be listening to some of my music now if it wasn‚Äôt available maybe give some more free songs and I found out about this app by my friends and they have the same problems
Has pretty much all the songs I want to hear and 80% of the time it's really reliable. But the other 20% there's a glitch in the system that pauses my music sometimes immediately after I push play. This has been a problem ever since I bought the app over a year ago.  So this is just a heads up to you future investors.
I have been using Spotify for so long , but I was wondering why from past till now you guys never try to provide us lyrics ?
It‚Äôs nice but sometimes I get stuff that‚Äôs completely unrelated to my music.
u should be able to download songs even if u don't have premium.  bc i just came from apple music and i was hoping that spotify would have gotten better.
I love everything about this app. It‚Äôs easy to control, all my music is right there, and it‚Äôs always easy for me to find new music. I gave them 4 stars because while they‚Äôre app is great it‚Äôs unfound on other devices which is unfair. If I‚Äôm gonna pay $10 a month for premium then I should be able to get it on all my devices. Otherwise I recommend this app to everyone I meet with a warning that they might not be able to find it.
All my playlists are stuck on the song I have them as but I‚Äôve just gotten used to the songs it plays that are not the song and now it continuously plays that one song and it‚Äôs really annoying so please fix I downloaded Spotify because I was tired of not being able to play songs on my phone honestly though Spotify needs to stop glitching with ads too
blah
A review that is almost a decade passed due. I've been preaching Spotify since 2011, or something like that. The best audio entertainment streaming service/library manager tool around!  I sure do miss the onboard messenger feature though (frown) 
LOOOVE  it, in my opinion WAY BETTER than pandora
It was a great experience using this app
Awesome record. Seen them when Van Halen opened for them years ago, and seen then come thru the Bay Area for the last time. Both times they blew me away. Ozzy never sounded better. Long Live Black Sabbath. The Original Black Sabbath!!!!!!
In certain ways Spotify can be way more easier to handle than iTunes because of the app layout. Because of this. iTunes often leaves me struggling to find my playlists while it feels like the ones in Spotify are easy to find. iTunes Music's search feature is less accessible while in Spotify you can search from anywhere. Which for me makes it easier to get that song I want to find right away. Spotify is faster than iTunes and overall a better expereience even though iTunes may look better, Spotify kills it at the end of the day for hours clocked verses any Music app I use. I love Spotify 
Nah it‚Äôs pretty good (premium)
I've used Pandora for the last few years but I decided to give Spotify a try. Happy I did! I like being able to make a list or group of songs. With Pandora I had to listen to them and thumbs up or thumbs down them. Not so bad but after a couple of thumbs down you reached your limit for skips and are stuck listening to songs you don't like or have to stop listening. With Spotify I listen to songs  and add which ones I like and I can only listen for a few seconds if I want to. I'm not stuck listening to the whole song. Great if you don't know the names to songs and want to listen to it for a few seconds to see if you like it. It's like unlimited skips. So far the advertisements have not been too intrusive. Thumbs up for Spotify!
I have also loved this app for several years, but I am so frustrated by the newest version or two!  Yep, it plays a couple of pieces from a playlist, then I can‚Äôt get it to stay within my playlists. I get tons of random recommended tunes/artists, which I am not in the mood to be subjected to just then.  Maybe there‚Äôs a setting I‚Äôve missed that will let me choose between my preferred artists and their recommended ones.  I‚Äôll look again, because I want it to be as good as it used to be! 
I never had a problem with Spotify until recently. I loved being able to shuffle all my songs but lately the shuffling doesn‚Äôt work. It only shuffles a few songs now. Don‚Äôt know what they changed but they need to fix it.
An album that I never heard before, enjoy to the max
Always bumping this app. Especially through the 5000 Watts slumping out my ride.
You always have the best music at your finger tips!
I just recently updated the app and it was honestly such a bad choice. I think the layout is just terrible, it literally gives the option to go premium an icon at the dash. And if you didn‚Äôt think they limited your options before now they really do, I can‚Äôt even search up my friends account from an iPhone. It only gives me the option to do so on a laptop completely defeating the purpose of the mobile device. Bad move spotify.
I know the score on the back of my hand Them other boys I thought they were down they kiss the rings I carry there crown.Nothing can break,Nothing could break me down is my favorite part but actually no I‚Äôm the man is the best part.Its on my party list.I like these songs and you get to pick them.ü¶Ñü¶Ñü¶Ñü¶Ñü¶ãü¶ãü¶ãü¶ãü¶ãü¶ãü¶ãü¶ãüê£ü¶Ñü¶Ñü¶Ñü¶Ñ
Good song stations
Simply awesome music app
There should be a quicker way to scroll on really long playlist like a little bar on the side like in Snapchat contacts
Out of all my music apps only one that pauses while I‚Äôm playing a song every 2 seconds into a song........dafuq
My only issue with Spotify is the ability to deque things off up next. When I que a Playlist and then change my mind halfway through my only option is to check 40+ songs and then remove to move to a new thread of music.
It's great listening while I work or go out to work out instead or maybe you should have free weekend where you can listen to music without shuffle play this can happen any day for any event you people at Spotify want to.
But the software is sometimes slow n connecting to devices can sometimes be a pain. Everything so far is pretty great. üëç
It‚Äôs awesome!
Great for music, can make your own playlists out of pretty much any song
i freaking love this app but i don‚Äôt like the fact you have to pay for premium but it‚Äôs whatever‚Äôs
Spotify is the OG. Easy to use and reliable.
Love it

App keeps crashing
I had to give it a five star because no other app has where you can learn about the lyrics while listening to the song.
So good
Amazing
Missing some songs, I‚Äôve had problems with playlists, and I HATE how they self-advertise!
Always has your jams and even the newest music
DO NOT get it. Plz. Because I got the newest update and like. I can‚Äôt go to my queue and delete songs anymore and that is a feature that I used A LOT SO PLZ DONT  like I hate it now. Bc if I shuffle play my daily mix, then change my mind and play a different playlist, once I‚Äôm done that playlist, itll just go right back to my daily mix and I hate thattttt   Ugh. If you‚Äôre reading this, fix it Spotify!!!  But otherwise this app is literally a godsend 
Bye bye pandora
Omg so good my fav songs are here so good expect great songs if you download it
Excelente
This app is the best to have your own playlist and always listen to songs you don't want to skip all the time
It as a lot of songs it's better the pandora and SoundCloud its just awesomeness it's the best thing I have on my phone
Spotify is really the best music streaming player for both PC and phones
App is good, but, there seems to be a bug when playing a song in the saved portion of an account. (Not sure if this affects more than one account) But after a couple seconds of playing, music randomly stops. Not liking at all... but the app is good.
I love this app I can find all my favorite artists, they have every song out there,they do show ads but they show less ads then YouTube,I can save battery well I listen to King Kendrick and I get notifications wen ever the migos release a new song..............if you like music this is not this app is not for you if you love music this is you're app
Really good app! Better than pandora. Spotify = üêê
Gushing
The world of music at my fingertips!
I‚Äôve had enough of this app. STILL NO WATCH APP. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs apples fault or they won‚Äôt play nice. Those are excuses. A watch app for Spotify doesn‚Äôt exist and it will most likely not exist for the foreseeable future. Until to does and probably after I‚Äôm staying with Apple Music.
Nice arrangement of songs !!
Spotify is great! I love listening to music on here!
I love this app and think it's great. But it takes up so much storage. My has barely any free storage so which means I can't do much because of storage limitations but I'm wondering how this app takes up so much storage like this is the second largest app on my phone with 1.41GB, like how does this take up that much storage so if you can could you possibly modify the app to where it won't take up so much storage.
My mom doesn‚Äôt allow me to spend money on my phone, so I rely on free apps to listen to music, etc. For the first week, I used a free trial, but after that expired it just started getting sucky. I would press ‚Äòshuffle play‚Äô, expecting a song from my playlists to play. But now I get completely irrelevent music that‚Äôs not on my playlists: for example, the Laos nation anthem when I had a Broadway musical album open!
Best streaming service ever.  More than happy to pay the fee for premium.  Tried apple and pandora, those don‚Äôt come close to this.
Very hard to see what track is playing with longer movement titles of larger classical works, and sometimes transitions between tracks are abrupt or cut off. Search function could use some work too, particularly for classical. OTOH, sound is good, and of course it‚Äôs great to have a massive music library in your pocket.
It‚Äôs a great app with great features, but I can‚Äôt use it very often, otherwise I would have to charge my phone every hour.
However,I would like to see all artist up to date. I can find all music up to date in Apple & Google play. Once this is fixed, I will give 5star.I gave it 4, because I like how you can fade the music into the next song,also how you merged with waze for Android & IOS.No other music stream has those features. 
Use to use it all the time. Now just a waste of space
Didn‚Äôt mean to only write 2 stars meant to put 4 but accidentally pushed the submit button. But overall this is a great music app would recommend it to anyone
¬°Es excelente y lo mejor de lo mejor!
Recently while listening to music between songs it pauses I really hope this gets fixed other than that it‚Äôs really nice
Super
I've been a loyal fan of Pandora since I was in 6th grade. As a sophomore in college, I finally made the switch to Spotify and I LOVE it!
I love this station if you want to relax have fun and enjoy yourself stay warm and clean Listen to music with Spotify
No random play,we wanna rock ! Get it ???!
His is great
Lots of music to be found here. Listening to a serious soundtrack right now‚Äîfor free! üëçüèæ
Recently I mainly hear music that isn‚Äôt related to the place list I selected in the slightest bit and it is very frustrating. This should be fixed, no one wants to use an app that allows them to listen to a bunch of random songs they aren‚Äôt interested in.
Excelent service :3
nothing bad to say
Crappy, sometimes it only plays one songs between ads,  and the ads are extremely inappropriate too
What happened to accessing Discover Weekly via mobile? I‚Äôm a yoga teacher and depend on this weekly playlist to keep my classes fresh.
GO LISTEN TO CLASSIC JACK RIGHT NOW!!! GO LISTEN TO CLASSIC JACK RIGHT NOW!!! GO LISTEN TO CLASSIC JACK RIGHT NOW!!! 
No permiten muchos saltos y no dan muchas promociones como Netflix

Great music at a commercial free way. Love it!
This is my favorite music app and it allows me to pick all my favorite artists. This app works perfect and is 5 stars all the way around. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
Feed your brain, feed your heart, feed your soul...
Great app! Found all of my favorite music. I Highly recommend it!!
I Love playing my music at night before bed and just allowing it to relax me. I also have perfect playlist for my yoga sessions which makes it easy to flow during practices.
It is a lovley app and Spotify is my #1 go to if I want to listen to music
Easy to use and great music.
De 10
This app is amazing I can‚Äôt tell you how much I love this app. Thank you Spotify. 
I'm on a family plan and the perks of the premium app are amazing. I haven't had any technical issues with the app. The greatest complaint I have is that the radios need to be a bit moe diversified after a while the same songs start to play. Nonetheless my musical palette has certainly expanded due to Spotify! Oh and the podcasts?! Awesome addition they're LIT!
Spotify is amazing for iPads! But on phones, it's just agricating. I'm young and when I make a playlists and shuffle it, I find that it only plays a small amount of my choices and some of the songs have profanity. I don't mind skips accept that I can't play my songs! Please fix this error.
I can listen to the music anytime! I love it!
I love Spotify because I can listen to my favorite music whenever and wherever I want!
If there is such thing as snow internet disease, then this is utter cancer.
The ads are very obnoxious and repetitive. Also it doesn‚Äôt make sense that I can‚Äôt choose individual songs on my phone but I can on Spotify on my desktop. Same rules should apply
I usually love Spotify, but ever since December I‚Äôve had issues. My password was reset by someone else in another country and they were able to make in app purchases linked to my credit card. Spotify was quick to resolve the issue and credit my account, but now a couple of months later they email me and tell me my password was compromised again and that they have reset it for me. They blamed it on me having the same password with another service... umm ok, how would you even know that? Whatever, I reset my password again, and now the app won‚Äôt even work. It opens but does nothing else. Can‚Äôt click on ‚ÄúLogin‚Äù or ‚ÄúCreate Account.‚Äù Seems like they are going downhill pretty fast, I may cancel my Premium subscription and just live without it.
I will admit I love the app but when I‚Äôm Listening to my music it will play some songs but then it just stops, and I have to manually play the song again, my sister told me you guys fixed it but I don‚Äôt have an update options so...help please
My most used app.
Love to share with my family and not have to pay for separate accounts. Price is worth it for everything the app allows you to do, plus hundreds of songs that you don‚Äôt have to buy and search for any song is awesome.
Good for listening to music
This app and service would get a 5 from me if it didn‚Äôt have a 10,000 limit on My Music.  I reached that limit when I moved over from Microsoft Groove and have not been able to save new songs or albums since.  I‚Äôm taking my albums over to Amazon Prime Music.
Love it. Premium is worth every penny
very nice and comfotable SoftÔºÅ
Please bring the preview feature back.
Is the best you should get it‚Äôs very good music in it
I love this app just you have to play it with WiFi. So I can‚Äôt listen to it out of the house. I want them to fix that cause I listen to music more out side than I do in my house. I hope we fix this.
A lot of stations for Latin Music
I write ratings to ensure the app publishers know how i feel.  Please ask me to rate again to ensure you read this rating on your changes and improvements that i don't know about. - Jj  (Satire based on their update logs being vague and non informative.) 
I love the app it is a really good app to use especially when traveling and you have songs download and the premium is only $9.99 so it makes it affordable and I think all together that the app is one of the best to use for music
Best music app
That‚Äôs so great
I love all they‚Äôre playlist and it‚Äôs easy to hear them even offline!!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Spotify
Just missing Mormon Tabernacle Choir that‚Äôs why 4 Stars
:)
Ever since the last update, almost nothing works.  Constantly get "an error occurred" message and only a few random albums play.  No search function, etc.  Same problem with multiple devices (iPad and iPhone), even after reinstalling.  No real customer service.  So, after years as a premium customer, I'm going to go check out Amazon Music.  They have a 30 trial going. 
V good but get premium
i wish it was easier to find clean versions of all my fav songs!
This is the best app(in my opinion) for music. Although you must pay premium for the full experience, it is really worth it! I cannot express in words how helpful it is, and the customer service is great too! But don‚Äôt just take my word for it, try it out yourself!
Add in feature to rearrange playlists like you can on computer? This would be very helpful and doesnt seem too difficult to add
Got to listen to my favorite songs for free
So worth it to get premium, great music platform
I would listen to a song for 9-10 seconds then it would stop. I would close and open the app again and it would do it  again probably 8 times till I got to a song I could listen to.
I love being able to listen to what I want when I want with Premium, sharing songs on social media (as long as they give the clips which I LOVE) & just about everything is available to listen to. Spotify is LIFE!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
this has been going on for months. the now playing song and last queue song invisible: i can‚Äôt see them and i can‚Äôt drag or delete the last queue song. i‚Äôve tried logging and and deleting and redownloading the app and that hasn‚Äôt worked.
The songs keep pausing. I don‚Äôt know why? Get this fixed!
The best music streaming app hands down second to none!!!!
Premium subscriber. Use the app constantly. Best investment for a music lover like myself
Very inappropriate ads. Giant variety of great music though. I have had this for almost a year now. Please get rid of the inappropriate ads. Ads are ok but not inappropriate ones.
Add the ability to add a playlist description and cover photo on mobile!!!!!!!!!!!! It would also be nice if you could see friend activity on mobile. And bring back the song preview!!!
There‚Äôs really no better way to enjoy Spotify than by using this app. I‚Äôm a fan.
Hands down the best app i have ever had !!! I love it !
That doesn‚Äôt need to be on premium
I prefer to queue songs cause it makes it easy for my self. Yet, the last song of my queues always seems too become blank and untouchable. But, it still plays the song . Just unable to move it or delete it
Please create a simple play/pause widget.   The selections are limitless and the premium subscription is MORE THAN WORTH IT!!! #TeamSpotify  Also, Lyrics only would be huge. 
Tried using apple music but it's missing a lot of the simple functionality that Spotify has to offer. I love the simple and easy to use design. Also the background dark color is perfect for listening to music without the bright light glare.  My only complain is I wish Spotify will one day bring more of the computer app features to the mobile app like the ability to edit the order and icon picture of your playlist. 
It is good if you pay premium, but if you are like me and you are looking for a free app to listen to music and enjoy your favorite artists, Spotify is not the app you are looking for.
Enjoying the welcome mix
I love it but it would be great to have on a Apple Watch other then that love it
Liked the app before, now its ONLY about premium
Gonna love it no matter what kind of music you likeüëå
It‚Äôs like a to go iPod from back in the day. But with extra features such as, listening to others playlists, and developing your own! I love it :)
If you are looking for an application for music please do yourself a favor and download this app. The only thing I would  acknowledge is maybe giving the consumer an opportunity to customize their very own account. Maybe that implies backgrounds or wallpaper themes I think that would give the consumer a nice outlook on things!
My first impressions were terrible at first. All these people had Spotify and I‚Äôm thinking why pay for music when I could just download it of from an illegal website. Spotify has way more than just music. They have podcasts and all these different genres so you could listen to some comedians or stream Taylor Swift. Downloading for offline listening is a great feature. Would I recommend, Well yes but it‚Äôs a bit expensive. I had previously listened to Pandora which kept getting all these ads and kept having adds. I recommend paying and having a membership. I don‚Äôt know or have tryed Apple Music but it seems ok but I think Spotify is pretty good.
So way can‚Äôt we have free skips I don‚Äôt have the money for this and when I‚Äôm not on wi fi I can‚Äôt get on Spotify
love spotify. the best for sharing music with your friends and people. premium is great.
This app used to be awesome but now it‚Äôs trash if u don‚Äôt pay you can‚Äôt do shi* you can‚Äôt even look at the last song you listened to and it plays multiply adds not even with two songs in between DONT BUY THIS APP ITS A SCAM
S√∫per
I recommend this app to anyone who what‚Äôs an app that‚Äôs easy to work with!!!
It is good for hearing pop music, hip hop, rap, and lot's of other music
Buena aplicaci√≥n para escuchar m√∫sica tranquilamente
I get the ads for premium but it never actually lets me get it there is no way on the app and the ads don‚Äôt take me to a place I can get it. I want it but it won‚Äôt let me get it.
I'm not sure if it's just my phone or what but every time  I go to listen to some of my music it gets through 3 or 4 songs and then stops working so I have to delete the app and re download it. Can you please fix it ?üòï
Excelente! La recomiendo
I wish we had yearly discounts though. One year for say $89?   Still love Spotify and having my own playlists and not having to listen to music I don‚Äôt want to listen to! For that it‚Äôll always be #1 
Cool
If you have an Android device Spotify is great but Apple on the other hand gets forgotten. Take, for instance, landscape mode. It has been implemented on Android but I guess the paying customer who have Apple devices are less important. I would totally give them a 5 star rating if they would just listen and implement this needed change.
I have done everything I could do to sync my songs to my iTunes, but nothing works. Can this be worked on at all???
The only music streaming app I've used for years. Gotta love Spotify! Love you too baby.
Yes you. JOESHP. Ni
Why in the hell would they make you pay for features that should come with the app. No respect.
There needs to be a way to censor songs. The worst is when you hear a song on the radio that is awesome and then play it on Spotify and learn you could never play this song around your little girl or at home with friends. Pandora allows you to block explicit content and so should Spotify if it wants to keep my business
Well you guys don‚Äôt even know Apple Music has a policy where as soon as you exit the app the music turns off. But you guys don‚Äôt do that also you guys let me take pictures while the music still playing... heck drag me down by one direction is playing right now
Great deal to get all the music you want for only 9.99 a month. Totally worth it if you listen to music
I been using Spotify for years and I never look back. I wish Spotify had an dedicated app for the Apple Watch. I hate that I got to grab my phone and open the App and play the music, from the phone and then I will have control on the watch. I wish I can go it from the dam Apple Watch!!! You will get 5 star if that happen!!!!!!!
Best music, best app, best everything‚ù§Ô∏è
You guys need to bring back the singles tab instead of the playlists tab
I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs not butter
I would totally recommend
I‚Äôve had Spotify since the beginning, I absolutely love it! Just 2 suggestions though.  1) could you tell us what you‚Äôre updating when an update is issued please?  2) on iPhone when I launch Spotify, the EQ doesn‚Äôt work for the first launch and I have to go to the option and ‚Äúwiggle‚Äù the EQ bar to ‚Äúwake‚Äù it up..  That‚Äôs all, thanks ^_^ 
üíûüíïüíóüíìüíñüíò
I like this app. It allows me to listen to music while I‚Äôm surfing the interweb on my phone.  Does anyone know how much WiFi data it takes up when streaming music? 
Using over 4 years
This app jumps around when I‚Äôm working out. Why is it so sensitive?
I have iPhone X and this app keeps freezing my phone. Specifically when I go to unplug it from playback in my car via aux cable. It keeps playing music but phone remains frozen. Can‚Äôt unlock, can‚Äôt to anything. I can‚Äôt even restart the phone. I just have to leave it there till the battery dies or it decides to magically auto restart 20 minutes later. Fix this
Spotify honestly is a good music app I wish that it had a couple more rap and hip hop artists but it‚Äôs still good.
They made me come here, you like this app rate it!!  I‚Äôm using it so it means I like it. How about just auto rate the app depending on how much you use it, it not like you aren‚Äôt watching us anyway! Does anyone read these!?!?!
I‚Äôve had this for a long time but until about 2 months ago ive heard songs that ive had on my playlist, but when i couldnt play the songs i wanted to play it would play other songs and would go on shuffle play. Ive started using this app a lot less because of the new and‚Äùcool‚Äù update. üòí
Works great, has a lot of songs but lots of adds
I‚Äôm new to getting music on my phone, this was easy to do and easy to use
Add me
I love this app so much and will use until the day I die! Way better than iTunes
App is great, I use it every day. However, whenever my playlist ends, random songs play. It should be related songs, but it usually isn‚Äôt. Also, whenever music is playing and I get a text, it pauses my music. Can I disable this?
I absolutely love this app. The 9.99$ a month is totally worth it! I've never had an issue with the app charging me more or anything. You can convert all your playlists to online so when you don't have service or wifi it all still plays. ‚ù§Ô∏èüíöüíõ this app
Music is life, and this app allows me access to almost all of my favorite music from all genres.
Spotify allows me to listen to all the songs I want. You can even make playlists. You can learn new songs and they can become your favorite songs. This is what happened with me and the song Galway Girl
They‚Äôre the best!
I think this is a great app I love it üòòüòò
I understand the concept of Spotify looking for new music you might like, but it‚Äôs annoying how when I shuffle a playlist from a certain artist, new songs show up that I honestly don‚Äôt want to listen to and I‚Äôve already skipped one too many times. Please change this!
I was looking for Julion Alvarez and RBD and nothing comes out super bummed!! Only reason I gave you 4 stars
I hope Spotify can work in the Middle East because it is such a great app
üôåüèΩ
I love it so far. Very versatile!
Literally Spotify makes my day every day ily
Love it
there‚Äôs no knack  not even ice knack 
I have had this app forever but just a few days ago I started to really love it because I got premium if I were you I would get premium definitely
wife added me to family plan and was skeptical at first but then I found old school music and now it's awesome thanks honey
This the BEST!!!!!!
This app is amazing, it takes up NO WIFI and it uses almost none of your battery, when I was in the car to California (I live in Ny) I only listed to Spotify the whole way. Never charged my phone once, I went in the car with 100% battery came out with 50%. And u can have a family plan and not have to pay for individual people. You can even have the same account on different devices.Over all I love this app. But, you have to have WiFi to listen to music not in your library. But either way definitely worth the money.
And if you don‚Äôt know, now you know.  Yiu know?  My only regret is not downloading you a long time ago. üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
Whenever I open a new app or get a notification the music just stops. It‚Äôs so annoying and it even does it when my phone is on silent. Please fix it so I can enjoy my music :(
My favorite
It‚Äôs so convenient!!!‚ù§Ô∏è it
Very easy to use
Im an iPhone user and honestly I‚Äôd rather pay for Apple subscription than to pay for this app that doesn‚Äôt work
√é≈°≈Ç√¥w k√®√ø d√¥p√®

Very comprehensive collection of artists. Better than Pandora.
Love this program!!
Wish I didn‚Äôt have to pay for premium but it‚Äôs worth it.
Great app. Spotify is my go to music app. But it would be great if you can make an easy way to add a bunch of songs to an already existing playlist that you‚Äôve made, instead of having to do them all individually
Love this app so much. Been using Spotify for about 4 years on premium and it is amazing. So far ahead of the competition. The thing that would really push them ahead of the competition is if you could select multiple songs to delete them, because as it is right now is kinda slow. And another suggestion is to have the filter/search bar always be there instead of having to slide up to bring it up. One last suggestion is having a double-tap to queue a song option, because that would be superb. Overall I still love the app and will continue to use it, these are just a few minor changes that would save a few seconds and make it easier/ better/faster for the user
Love this app, you can save listened play any where and on any place
Love it. It is one of the best music apps I have ever used. It is super easy to use. You can find your favorite songs very easily. You can also find new songs.
Spotify is a great app, I absolutely love it. No glitches or anything. I think anyone should get it.
I love finding a playlist like classical guitar or piano, or 80s hits or something, and then adding songs I hear to my own playlists. Finding new music to love has never been easier!
I had Spotify since I was in 6h grade and now I‚Äôm in 9th grade and these Spotify songs bring so many memories back from the good times I had in middle school and I love it a lot‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Spotify is the best and I hope it never leaves üíï
Love it
Love this app the only thing it‚Äôs lacking is a sleep timer to shut the music off if you happen to be listening music while going to sleep.
Great music , very happy .
AWESOME,   WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY!  THANK YOU  BILL 
i love this app omg !!!
When I play a song then pause it and exit the app, when I enter again it would speed up the song just talks to fast and glitches, which really needs to be fixed because really I don‚Äôt wanna restart the app each time so. That is a big bug for me.
When I got Spotify I nutted hard  Shoutout C4 gang 
The best thing since walkman üòÇ
Im ok with there being adds but for gods sake don't force me to always use shuffle just because Im a free user. Like for real most of the time adds are all you get if you‚Äôre a free user of an app but this app forces you to always use shuffle instead of picking which song yo want. Plus adds. Oh and forget sampling songs that aren't on your play list To see if you want to add then. The app makes that difficult too. 
Greatest thing since sliced bread!
The quality of streaming is great on Spotify Music. I would highly recommend this app.
The best in music broadcasting
I absolutely love this app, though there is one problem. There is no way to play one song at once, if I want to listen to a specific song I can't. I wish this could be an option. Thank you!
Has all the music I want, makes suggestions for new music based on my tastes & is easy to use on all devices!
Works really well with my Google Home.
Lo mejor de lo mejor
It's so good and smooth and I can finally find all my music that I want to listen too instead of listening to SoundCloud.

I don‚Äôt understand any of it AT ALL! I go to play a song and then it just goes to shuffle and just plays a totally DIFFERENT song! It‚Äôs so annoying! If my phone hadn‚Äôt have crashed I would still have my FAVORITE music app but since they deleted it I can‚Äôt get it back (iMusic) they have another iMusic just not like the one I had.... and I thought Spotify would be amazing then I realized that it‚Äôs TERRIBLE!
What is the point of a playlist if u can‚Äôt even listen to the songs in it without premium ?
For the love of god give us an option for landscape layout before judgment day comes!!! Even Apple Music, which I gave up, and is from Apple doesn‚Äôt have a landscape option.  Beat Them To It! 
Beat app
The best it‚Äôs worth ten bucks a month. Music is clear and it the new and old hits.
On iTunes you pay 2 dollars for a song, on Spotify it‚Äôs free for most songs

üòäxxxx
great app. I have discovered a lot of great bands using Spotify. Specially La Obra De Marte
The app is great overall, except whenever I lock my phone and let an album or playlist play, the app doesn‚Äôt play the next song in que. I have the latest Spotify update and latest iOS update, so updating isn‚Äôt a problem. Please fix, this is making the app bad. The app stops the song about 3-4 seconds before the end, and I have to manually go select the next song after every song ends
A great part of most days.
There are some songs that I thought you had but you don‚Äôt. Its not a bad app, I use it all the time but I highly recommend that you add more song.
This is amazingüíØüíØ
I have many complaints about this music app okay?! Look it's good and all but you guys do realize not everybody has the money to just listen to the song we want. And all the hacks I've been doing just to get to it, you guys are blocking it somehow and I hate it! WHEN WILL YOU REALIZE THAT NOT EVERYBODY IS RICH BEYOND THEIR DREAMS TO GET WHAT THEY WANT??!! I'd rather get Pandora or someone else instead of you guys if you keep it up which you will. And all the ads are just unnecessary. You make the point that we don't wanna hear it, but in order to NOT hear them is to pay off our money for more important things?! You guys are cold-hearted and I hope you actually use your lives looking for something not as useless as money. Also stop changing the pitch of songs. It‚Äôs annoying
Better than ever I love it !!!üëç
Love it especially discover weekly. The only way i find (new to me) music.
I love Spotify
Very cool.
I love this app!! I just wish the premium wasn‚Äôt so expensive.
Spotify: IF, you watch this video you will receive 30 minutes of ad-free music. Yes really click to watch video.  *watches video*   *2 minutes later*: watch this video for 30 min....  Me: it‚Äôs not like they even give you a choice. Even if you don‚Äôt click the video it will make you watch it anyways. 
Good music free
How is there not an option to sort playlists yet? I.e alphabetically by song or artist, by date added, etc. I hate having to pull up the playlist then scroll to the very bottom to play the songs I recently added to the playlist. Logically, the most recent should go at the top and if the user wants to rearrange, they can.   Same goes with playlists order themselves.   It‚Äôs also annoying how long it takes for the app to start up especially on a computer. And once it does, it takes forever just to recognize your internet.   This app isn‚Äôt car friendly at all, which is a huge problem considering that‚Äôs when I use it most. Make it easier for the user to navigate! 
I love it
Excellent
Great app with TONS of music
Best thing ever
Very good
Love this appppppp sooo much the best music app ever
Love that it connects with my SoundHound app!!!

i love this app it‚Äôs literally the best & after I used the free trial up I thought it was over but it‚Äôs not, it works great without it and I have no problems at all. now I can listen to all my mcr all day long ty spotify! ‚ô°
So my mom and my dad got this family thing were we all get music you know where you don‚Äôt have to watch a add and it‚Äôs pretty great cause those adds where getting boring...anyways I really like how there‚Äôs so much music to listen to and instead of going to YouTube and having to leave your phone on you got Spotify where you can have your phone off!

Need to listen to it amazing soundtrack for an amazing movie
The best app in the world for music !!!! Love it
I just got Spotify, verified and everything. It doesn‚Äôt let me get premium, it says I can‚Äôt buy it on this app, I need help :/
Love this app I would give it a slight edge over Pandora.
I'm a Premium subscriber and I love it. I make use of the offline listening feature constantly. This is exactly where my problem is, however - the recent removal of the "Downloads" selection in the library is immensely annoying. I enjoy downloading whole albums and listening to them all the way through, and the large album art of these in that Downloads menu was great, being pretty much reserved for albums that you had saved in their entirety, so it was like an easy-to-access and good looking virtual album library. The interface was bugged, often not responding to any inputs after unlocking my phone, but other than that it was a nice addition. Now it's gone. I miss it. It made Spotify nicer and easier to use for me. There are other similar gripes, especially with the UI design (it takes so much effort to just filter by downloads, WHY CAN'T I PLAY SONGS THAT ARE CACHED TO STORAGE BUT I HAVEN'T EXPLICITLY SELECTED DOWNLOAD ON THEM - A HUGE PAIN IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY REMOVE A SONG FROM YOUR LIBRARY WHILE AWAY FROM WIFI), but the service itself - high quality streaming with no ads, and offline listening - is well worth the price.
Great selection of songs
Could have more skips than just six!!!!
I love this app because, unlike Pandora; this app offers you more music and artists than ever before!
Better than pandora.....
Truly one of the great apps!  Everyone simply has to include music in their life.  Spotify allows you to create and carry the soundtrack of your life anywhere and everywhere.
This is awesome I can believe I turned down Spotify but they keep on coming up with new things I think Spotify is probably the best music player you could ever get out there Apple Music is bs.
I love using Spotify!  Making my own playlists is my favorite part.
Great product, no freezes or errors
Great service with an intuitive app. Paid $99 + taxes for a whole year of service- perfect price! Wish they had an app for Apple Watch though!
Love it
Bet
Stellar platform good to use in the desert when no WiFi is nearby
The best way to get and listen to music.
Great app for music
Sometimes I don‚Äôt have the time to listen to a song or album but don‚Äôt want to forget to listen to it, I think an option to save the album/song/playlist would be really useful to music lovers.
Great music app üòÉüëçüèæüëçüèæüòÅ
I have been having problems with my Spotify. Can you look into it. My Spotify has been jumping songs, pausing, going back to the previous songs, and logging me out of my account. It‚Äôs been pretty annoying. I do not do anything with my Spotify (I just let it run). I have also exit out of the app and restarting my phone and it still does. Thanks for the support.
A+
It used to be the app I used for music everyday but then one day after an update they added a suggestion track and now I barely hear the songs I put on a playlist anymore and also when I want to play a different song it won‚Äôt let me and no matter how many times I hit the shuffle button it won‚Äôt work ether. And so this stuff will stop happening I have been trying to get premium but I don‚Äôt know where it is located and I have search everywhere and still can‚Äôt find it.
You can listen to Grace VanderWaal She‚Äôs amazing 
I have enjoyed the free version it is really very good, I have no issues, I would recommend it to all music lovers. I wish it had more Indian music collection
I cannot review this app because I am codependent with it.
Music Lover USA live the songs that were picked for me awesome job will do it again thanks
Best app!!!!
Spotify has been my fantastic channel which I can listen to my favorite international music from around the world. I love you ‚Äúmy SPOTIFY‚Äù.
Good!!!!!!!!!
It‚Äôs up to you what you want. I say yes.
Mixes do not disappoint
Spotify is amazing actually it‚Äôs better than Apple Music by far
My music keeps skipping

The best app for music period..
I have the premium service and love it. Especially on android. There I can use a bass booster/equalizer app (not available on iPhones) and it sounds amazing. On the iPhone I can download a separate eq app just for Spotify but I‚Äôm hesitant to buy it just yet. Also every once in a while some of my downloaded songs just stop working, I have to redownload them. Not great when you don‚Äôt have data service. So sometimes I have to go without my favorite songs. Another point, why can‚Äôt I just download one song instead of the whole album? It‚Äôs on a Galaxy s3 but the app is up to date. Before I cancel my subscription I want to test it out on my iPhone. Since I haven‚Äôt had one in a while.  But the iTunes streaming service makes using an equalizer impossible since all files are DRM protected. I didn‚Äôt have this problem on my Galaxy but I didn‚Äôt give it much chance on my iPhone before I deleted it.  The layout also changed, from when you selected an artist it would be separated by album and each album was separated from each other. In the iPhone app it‚Äôs just one solid line of songs, so very confusing. Please please fix these problems so I can enjoy this great service better on my iPhone. 
It is awesome but they should let people with out premium download songs or a playlist
Great way to play your favorites.
The most recent update created a problem. Whenever I select an action for a song, whether it is to like it or never play again, the app crashes. I have tried reinstalling the app, but it's more of the same. I am on IOS 9 which may be part of the problem, but this issue is still annoying.
So far it‚Äôs been üëç  Keep up the good work guys üëäüèª 
I thinks it‚Äôs good app but not a great app
Amazing
Good music library but i can not accept the fact that I need premium membership to stream music to my sonos speakers.
I love the music but I can‚Äôt figure out how to ‚Äúselect‚Äù a certain song rather than the ‚Äúshuffle play‚Äù that is my only option to play
I love it
When I play my playlists, I hardly ever hear the songs that I added onto that playlist. All that plays are the songs that‚Äôs are suggested. It‚Äôs annoying me so much. I want to listen to the songs I put on my playlist NOT the songs that‚Äôs are suggested. There is a reason why I put those songs on my playlist.
Lots of variety for free and not impossible to enjoy without spending money.  Nice balance
Most definitely the best music app I‚Äôve ever used. Even tho it has ads they aren‚Äôt stupid random ads they are mostly Spotify ads. Super easy to use and never gets stuck on my phone. Better than Pandora as well
I‚Äôm a premium user, quality is great! I strongly recommend Spotify. 
Fire
The variety of music will never allow you to become bored...
Just noticed within the last week and a half that while listening to my song library on shuffle, it‚Äôs playing the songs I recently added and not shuffling throughout my entire library!! Super annoying!! I love Spotify but please fix this so I can give it 5 stars again!!!!! ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
I can‚Äôt listen to any songs unless I have premium which I can get because I‚Äôm a kid with no mineyüò°üòæ
Being able to take your music all over the world is wonderful
It has a lot of songs but it's not very easy to use and the black backdrop is kind of boring and depressing
The best radio !! The best
Greatttttt super
It‚Äôs AMAZING
I understand that I should pay if I don‚Äôt want ads, but one ad to announce that there is an ad coming up. Followed by three ads, and then another one thanking me for listening to the ads is a little excessive.
Me like music and it do good at music so me like app
Have it for the whole family
Trust me
I‚Äôm addicted to this app if you want to listen to your preferred musics. Lot of choices without too much restrictions.
I‚Äôve had mixed feeling but I love the playlists and wished it had access to mastered live YouTube videos of the artists such as robert glasper and his fresh jazz. I love you more than Apple Music, because you care about everybody but the guy who wants to add their own recordings .wav into playlists.
ME encanta!!!
Great app
This a great app for free the only problem is that you can't choose a song you have to shuffle you have to like the whole album of the artist than one song also there are ads just a reminder
Spotify is the best yeah but still I think it is BEST THING IN THE WORLD
Great app love it so much use it everydayüôèüèªü§ôüèΩüé∂üé∂üé∂
Very good
I love Spotify for many reasons. It has a vast selection of music and if you subscribe you won‚Äôt regret it. It‚Äôs my favourite streaming service
I love Spotify!! It‚Äôs the best way to connect with music and I get crazy if I don‚Äôt have music for too long. Thank you!
BEST MUSIC APP EVERüòÅü§™üôÇü§üüèºüî•üî•üî•
I love this app definitely worth the money üòä
It is so fun I love the music and u get to make your own playlist so you can listen to the kinds of musics that you want to listen to
Great format,especially on the iPad pro
Love how it‚Äôs integrated into my in home system.
...it would be much better if the que had an option to delete songs in the shuffle rather than rearrange them..
Spotify is rlly good and I enjoy it. Rate 5 stars hope you guys enjoy too :)
Subscribe!
Love their lists and radio. Smooth to operate too.
I am a premium member and have been for a while. A few months ago an issue start where a song would start, play for a few seconds, and then stop. I followed the directions Spotify has online for this issue and it actually managed to make it worse. To top it off there is no way to contact customer service. I was excited when I joined Spotify, however now I am disappointed.
Good music selection and app. More friendly than Apple Music.
Love
Great Album
I love Spotify but something happened and it signed me out and won‚Äôt let me sign back in. I really could use a fixing! Thank you for such a great app.
Great
If you want to find a clean version of a song, or a remix, or sometimes even just the normal version of a song (mostly if it‚Äôs not popular) you won‚Äôt be able to find it, since Spotify doesn‚Äôt have it. Other than this it‚Äôs pretty good. (I have used premium for a few months, and free for a few years) I would say premium is worth it. (Especially in summer if you get 3 months for 99 cents) overall a good app.
Love it
It‚Äôs a FANTASTIC app. And since people keep complaining about the payment,I think it‚Äôs actually a very good thing that we pay for the music because, well, it supports the artist. It would also be great if they added a ‚Äútimer‚Äù option... so the music would stop playing after a specific time :)
Good!!!
Reasonably priced and filled with great music and community-made playlists.
When I try to open login or create a account nothing happens it‚Äôs like the app is stuck at the startup
This app used to be my absolute favorite app I use Spotify everyday. Recently however it won‚Äôt let me listen to more than a few seconds of a song before it skips to the next. Very frustrating, this needs to be fixed immediately!
Premium is the best $10 i spend every month
I like too much !!
i used this feature a lot and it was very helpful. please bring it back asap
Logged out a few days ago and now can‚Äôt log back in. When I click any of the sign in/create new account buttons nothing happens. Same problem even after new download, very sad :(
perfect except i wish u could listen on more than one device at one time
That‚Äôs very very nice üî•‚ù§Ô∏è
Awesome way to organize and choose great music! Go My Buddy Mike!!!
Free music, whole albums and free queso?!?!... Not-o even-o Ray-o Rice-o could-o beat it-o (not-o even-0 in an elevator-o)! K-bye!!
Great app, especially with premium
Spotify is so good to listen to music , you don‚Äôt have to stay on the app and all of your favorite hits are on there . I love the app so much and I recommend that you download it ‚ù§Ô∏è
Wow! I really enjoy Spotify, it is a wonderful app that I just absolutely love, though I do hate how I have a limited amount of skips.
Other then that, this Is a perfect app
Selection, quality, and service. What else? I just want the artists compensated and I hope I‚Äôm doing that. My daughter put this on the phone.
I would give it a higher rating but , okay so I have a playlist yk & im a metal head I listen to guns & roses , Metallica, asking alexandria etc... so I don‚Äôt have premium and when I press ‚Äúshuffle play‚Äù because if you don‚Äôt have premium you can‚Äôt pick the song you want to listen to which is dumb , and I rarely hear the songs they play like less than 5 times in a day , I had to uninstall the app , I like to have control over the music I listen to
I tried downloading it but it didn‚Äôt work this happened so many times
Love it , any type at any time enjoy en relax  House-beach-Roudtrip etc just love it üëå 
Love it
New Spotify is amazing. The end.
Love Spotify!
Love it!
It works really well and I like the fact that you can watch one ad for 30 mins of ad free music. The only thing I find annoying is that you can‚Äôt buy it ad free
I‚Äôve been using Spotify for years and it still improves!! üíØüÖ∞Ô∏è
It‚Äôs supper goooooood
High quality music at my fingertips
So awesome!!
i love love it i pay premium and is the best!!! i use it everyday and i have no complains at all i recommend it and $10 a month for premium is worth it
I do not love me that you do not let us pick the next song unless we have the premium package everything else is ok
It‚Äôs ok but awesome. XD                                       -Someone 
I think the whole app it's self it's pretty good especially the premium. Choose your favorite song!
Anytime I‚Äôm cleaning, cooking or playing video games I always have Spotify jamming
5 stars
Helps me focus while doing homework
Very good
Yasss love it
Spotify is amazing I just wish it was free otherwise it‚Äôs amazing.
It is the best
Love it. Keeps all my faves in one playlist
A must have for music
I love this app it is supper easy and I can put on whatever music I want for free!
Great app
Great album. Love her Brazilian arrangements.
I tried all of the other streaming services and Spotify is the best one for me
I love this app it is so useful and I can do so much best of all its free I am always listening to music on here
Hi-Res audio please
I love this app
Lots of music for every mood and taste!
Me encanta esta app
This app is lit!
I ‚ù§Ô∏è Spotify. When I need space, I delete it. A few days later I NEED MUSIC AND I DOWNLOAD IT AGAIN! I love it! But one thing, you should let people (and me) play the songs we have in the playlist. Not the SIMILAR ones in the playlist. That‚Äôs all, and thanks!
I love the music
Been using Spotify for some time now.  It would be nice if there was a choice for not playing a sound again on the free version.  With this feature it would be 5 stars for me.
Nice app no too much add.
I love that you don‚Äôt have to pay for the music, and even if you exit the app the music will still play, unlike some apps I‚Äôve tried out ^^ Five stars, amazing
Adding, changing and modifying your subscription in anyway is the worst experience with Spotify. Makes users not want to join at all. Please make this better.
Sooo Amazing! And also Add me on SC @xoprettyladyxox
Love the selection that is available- even found oldies that my grandma lives!
Love listening to top artist, in the with ads version.
I love spotify ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüò≠ so much that I'm actually paying for it !!
Very good stuff
I like this app just don‚Äôt like how there‚Äôs adds
Have you ever tried to contact Spotify with an issue? Issues happen a lot. Their customer facing methods of contacting them are nearly impossible to find. When you do and submit your question, the auto reply immediately kicks back a message saying ‚Äúfigure it out, or tweet us or...‚Äù Someone gifted a subscription to me. While I appreciate their thought, the frustration that comes along with actually trying to use it isn‚Äôt worth it. 
Hi I think Spotify is great but I think the premium is a little annoying so if you could take it off for more than a month or even a year that would mean the world to me bye
It‚Äôs awesome you should totally download this app
Absolutely fantastic.
Yassssss
Hands down the best quality. Some quirks like your need premium to play from receiver, you can still use Bluetooth or airplay. Took away 1 star for that but Love it!
It‚Äôs true it worked a week ago and now it won‚Äôt show in my library
Perfect.
I'm happy üëç
Fix it, it‚Äôs not a good music app people come here to listen to music that isn‚Äôt on SoundCloud or anything else maybe they can‚Äôt buy the song on Apple Music but they come here to listen to it not to attempt to listen to there song and a completely different song comes on they don‚Äôt even know it‚Äôs dumb
I like this app on my IPad but on my iPhone albums I picked wont let me turn off shuffle. Really bad been trying to turn shuffle off for a year now.
Best app ever!
Love it
Amazing music service. Compatible with so many other services and devices. My one issue is that it‚Äôs very glitchy.
I love Spotify especially the new offer 3 months only 0.99$ :) LOVE LOVE ‚ô•Ô∏è
I like this app a lot cause just when I thought I couldn‚Äôt find an artist I looked up the name and there it was I was like hell yea!!!!!!!!! I would recommend this app to everyone
I wish it was free
Surprisingly superb!
Great Music app, I have been in love since I downloaded it! Thank you
So, I used to have Spotify on my iPad and just got it on my phone. The app will not allow me to play songs without shuffling the playlist. I think that is a terrible feature and I will probably be deleting Spotify. This app used to be great but now it‚Äôs really going downhill
Truly made to help the artist! This is a true music streaming service designed to help the people who make it possible. They also help students like myself with cheaper rates and Hulu as well.  They also support artist like 3lau, who create music to help others!
I use to love Spotify (we have premium) but in the last few months when I‚Äôm listening to my playlist it‚Äôll have it muted randomly. Shows it‚Äôs still playing but no sound. Then randomly will start playing again. I have deleted the app and force quit and it still continues to do this. May have to cancel because I am over it!!!!
I had only been using it for about two weeks but I could already tell that it is worth a five star due to its immense music selection while making it extremely easy to add song and search them or their artists. The only poor quality I could think of is that you need premium to choose what song you listen to on the phone but not on a tablet (Kindle Fire).
I‚Äôve been using Spotify for the past few years now and I can say I‚Äôve enjoyed every minute of it, but the one thing that would be such a simple fix has yet to be added after seeing so many people ask for it. Spotify on the phone does not allow for you to look up the clean version of a song, that option is only available on computer. The way it works on the computer is that you click on the album the song is in and scroll to the bottom and click on more releases and it will show you the clean one(or any other versions of the album like a deluxe if they have it). It works super well on the computer and I don‚Äôt see how hard it could honestly be to add it to the phone. It just seems like Spotify doesn‚Äôt care because the past few updates they‚Äôve had on the phone don‚Äôt seem to be changing anything that I‚Äôve been experiencing. Anyways, I hope Spotify sees this and can really take it into consideration.
Love this application. Keeps on getting better!!
Great app!
I came from pandora and I actually found it to be way better
Works very well when you pay. Only thing that bothers me, is when spotify takes for ever to put a new song that is on youtube for a week or longer. Other than that good app for music.
It goes great with beer.
Love Spotify always my fav
I love to use this app, and I think that the limitations that you have are very acceptable. But one thing that really bothers me is the fact that there‚Äôs SO. MANY. ADDS! There‚Äôs adds in between every other song, and when I mean adds, I mean, there‚Äôs two or sometimes three adds in between almost every song. I like the app in itself, and there are a few glitches, but one thing is that the adds are so freaking insane! Tone the adds down a bit!
I love Spotify! It‚Äôs my main source for music and it works so well. I would love for there to be an Apple Watch app so I could change my music on it!
AWESOME!!!
After having trouble with some account features, i had the Spotify team transfer my account to a non-Facebook-initiated account. Since then, no issues. Super easy.
I think this app is wonderful since you can play it in the backround
Certain features that you pay for would make it better, but the free version is great. Great stuff!
His music is awesome and Spotify make it even more enjoyable!  Visiting my son in Germany and Pandora wouldn‚Äôt even work!!
Very good app
Spotify was great at first. Many people used it so i decided to give it a try. I loved it but after 2 days of having the app it began to kick me out whenever i tried to open it. I deleted and redownloaded it and even changed my password but it still kicks me out. I am very disappointed and annoyed. I reached out to spotify to fix it but no such luck. Such a disappointment.
God create this app in the begging of the times when create Adan an Eva. God say, the world is yours and take this app for listen music in the world.
Big fan of the 30 minute commercial free blocks!
Best place to hear Vern Matz
üòçüòçüòçüò≠
best app ever
I love Spotify so much!
So easy. Radio.
It was a good app but now you need premium to do pretty much anything. I understand if premium is you can download music, any song, and higher quality, but premium for unlimited skips, not random songs and not being able to see the list of songs next is the most retarded bull*hit I've ever heard. Was great now it's shi*.
I love this app. I love to listen to songs on the road and not to worry about paying for so many songs. I can listen to almost infinity songs for the price of one! Family deal is not bad. Wish i could be just alittle lower but for the long run its not bad.
Love it. All the music old and new that I love. I'm even discovering things I didn't know about, and I thought I knew everything about R&B.
Big music lover and it blew my mind! So much better than the tired music on pandora and less commercials. Nice to find an app that loves music like I do!
Enjoy
Great use of tech for playlists certain artists and building your own playlists you can share. Love it.
I work in a machine shop and music makes the long shifts a lot easier. I created a long playlist out of all our favorite songs and I just shuffle play it everyday. The other guys love it and so do I
Love that it can connect to other devices in the house and you can still control it from your phone!!!!
So I love this app! But, I wish that we could listen to music off of wifi without getting premium it would be a lot cheaper and especially with people who travel.
This is awesome!  I would give it  a 5 if it actually played the album I want though... 
From playlists to finding new music, it‚Äôs still my favorite service.
More songs!!
nice selections and variety
Big selection of music to enjoy - love it !
.
Love it. Try Declaration church channel!
Love it!
Nice app
Great varitey
I love this app, especially premium because I get ALL the new music on Friday‚Äôs, wether it‚Äôs a single or whole album. I can also search nearly any old school song and it will find it. I love it. Spotify also syncs to many other apps such as Waze, Nike Run app (NRC), and many others. If your looking for an app that has it all, look no more!
App had been working perfectly on my 5s until the most recent update. Now I cannot get any playlist or radio to auto play the next song, even after a restart/fresh install. Affects playing from the device locally and over Bluetooth, or chrome-casting.
I love the Discovery, however it should be way easier to manage an off line library and rate songs etc.
La mejor app de todas
Spotify is nice but you have very limited skips and I find myself having to listen to many songs in my playlist which I would rather not listen too. Spotify on the computer is way better. You don‚Äôt have to pay to be able to skip. On the computer Spotify is amazing.
If you love music, this is the app for you!
Love this app! #NurseMomLife
i like
Dear Spotify,   You're the greatest except when it comes to your thumbs up and down. Why not ask us "Are you sure you want to dislike this song?" or some sort of undo option? I heard a song I fell in love with and excitedly went to hit the plus sign, but accidentally hit dislike instead. I didn't even give myself the chance to read the title of the song or artist because I was too excited to get it into my playlist. I'll never know what that song was. It's like when love at first sight happens, but someone comes in to snatch them away from you before you could even get their name... it hurts. Please repair this wound for the musical sound I long for.   Sincerely,   A Sad Spotifier  P.S. The song I fell in love with was in the Bedroom Pop playlist. If that helps at all.. 
Tbh it‚Äôs the best app that I use and when I get Spotify premium it‚Äôs gonna be even better
I love the somgsüòç
love it
I can‚Äôt see my queue anymore and I‚Äôm not sure why.. I have a feeling that it‚Äôs an update and I‚Äôm nit excited about it...  other than that I love the app, especially the daily mixes 
I love Spotify as a musician it help get my music heard around the world check me out Souljahofdadub
I just want the ability to change my name from a bunch of random numbers and letters.
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I love this app a lot but lately my playlists have been getting deleted by themselves. I did not delete them, but they are being deleted and it‚Äôs really frustrating. It‚Äôs been a month since I realized it and today one of my playlists was deleted again, now I have to remake itüôÑ
That's all I can say
LOVE IT!
Spotify lets me add songs I already know I like...I like that I can also create a playlist and remove anything new I have not heard before and remove...I can't do that with Pandora...I look up an artist and Pandora automatically makes that a playlist with other artist of similar style songs..
I play guitar. One of the most important thing I need is to get to a song quickly, Spotify give me that, with any song I need, if I could give 10 stars I would
ü§ô
Don't let your playlist end or it'll start pumping garbage pop garbage in your ear.  Amazing they still pull this BS even with premium...
Great variety!
My opinion has no motha ***** value but I‚Äôd buy stock in this app
Why is Spotify not working on my phone
I like it. I love it. I like it. 
I love being able to customize my playlists and share with others.
Great
Why suggest and play this russian song I can‚Äôt understand when I was listening to snoop dogg!!
Too many suggested songs are being played when I just want to listen to an album or playlist. Spotify, if this is a ploy to get more people to get Premium, this is a bad idea. You're ruining the app.
It‚Äôs awesome
This is my app. Love love love!
With shuffle on it only plays a-c. What‚Äôs going on!
I love this app I wish it had more skips though. Thank you for letting me listen to my favorite music for free!
I like it
This is the best app but I wish u could listen to it offline
Door af
My computer Spotify works just fine but this app is trash. Forcing me to listen to stupid random songs and you know what Spotify??? If I pay premium it will be for Apple Music which is 2 bucks cheaper and 50 times better:p  Make the service better and I'd possibly pay premium. Make it crap and you get nothing from me and lose customer. 
Love it!can listen to all my favorites without having to spend money
I love this app. So much music for every mood that you could possibly be in without needing to program yourself
They are overpriced for just music but a very good source for music
Lit
please add a clear cache button.
It's so great I love so much
Just great stuff!
Can‚Äôt listen to or even pay to listen to Spotify Japan  No streamable watch app. 
I love this app, but without premium you can‚Äôt choose the song, download, and you can only play on shuffle.
It‚Äôs a really good music app
not hard to understand and no restrictions lets u do anything
Thank you for give me music when I‚Äôm on the move or when I feel sad . Cause music is a big part of my life so thank you.                                        Sincerely,                                       Alpha wolfy 
Enjoy the tracks they have.  Haven‚Äôt really tried anything obscure yet though.
This is what I was looking for, very content so far
Best music app ever
It's Spotify, how can you not give it 5 stars?
Can it be any better
Love Spotify!!! Super cool
Would give 5 stars but too many restrictions
Love listening to the choices built, better than Pandora.
I have had this app for quite some time, and I really like how you can create your own playlists. Also, love how this app creates a playlist for you off of what music you listen too giving you a great mix of pop, rap, electric, country, etc. instead of a certain genre. My star rating has gone from a 5‚≠êÔ∏è to a 4‚≠êÔ∏è because the app has taken away a great feature for those who don't have premium. When searching for a song, you could hold the selection down to hear if that was a song you were looking for or liked the sound. Now, I have to onto iTunes to listen to the song b4 being able to add it to my playlist. Please bring this feature back and you will get your 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è rating back.
It‚Äôs a awesome music app. I love all the features. Very easy to use and has all the new songs. Make your own album and enjoy!
Awesome
For the longest time i have spotify but recently it keeps telling me i reach my limit of music, really disappointing
I love listening to music on this app
Litüî•üî•üî•
It works really well, but songs like agust d aren‚Äôt the sadly, and tt is only in Japanese. But other than that it is a great app and I absolutely love it!
The Suggested playlists are annoying  Other than that the app is cool 
I like its features.
I‚Äôve had Spotify for years and Pandora in my opinion was the only music streaming service that could come close. With ‚ÄúThe Music Genome Project‚Äù that Pandora has driving their service, having a good ‚Äúshuffle & forget‚Äù run of music came pretty easy with a decently trained channel. Spotify was always good for finding ‚Äúthat song‚Äù and selectively putting together your playlists however. The ‚Äústudent rate‚Äù that Spotify offers right now (as of February 2018), makes it a great deal at $4.99 a month. Spotify does use ‚ÄúSheerID‚Äù to verify active enrollment so don‚Äôt think you can pull a fast one on them. The student rate also comes WITH the ‚Äúlimited commercials‚Äù version of the video streaming service, Hulu too at that price, but I‚Äôm not a fan of what they consider ‚Äúlimited‚Äù so I still think Spotify is deal by itself for $5 a month.    I don‚Äôt have anything bad in particular to say about Spotify really. However, the bottom line is that Spotify hasn‚Äôt done anything ground breaking to remain competitive in a market that has been slowly filling up with contenders trying to take that #1 spot. So basically when I no longer qualify for the student rate and have to pay the full price of $9.99 a month (without Hulu), I WILL FOR SURE be exploring my options because while I am a fan of the service, the functionality, and the student rate, Spotify isn‚Äôt leading the pack in huge strides or anything. The competition with other music streaming services like Apple, Prime, & Pandora is SO close, that the in time it has taken you to read this novel of a review I‚Äôve written, Spotify might have already been beaten out by the competition.  Okay, now go and rest your eyes from all this reading. Chances are slim that you have an attention span capable of making it this far without pictures. üî• 
Dope
hate this appjejhejhh
Love Spotify it has all the music I love and more over all üëå
Gr8
Love creating stations.
I love the app, but the suggested track function is so annoying. Like i can understand it, but maybe make it so that you can toggle it on and off, or limit it to like 2-3 suggested songs for every 10 songs on the playlist? Like i have a really niche taste in music, and i like discovering new stuff, but half the suggested songs i get aren‚Äôt even related to what im listening to.
I like this app for music, and it allows you to listen to practically anything you want. I still prefer it on the computer though. It allows you to listen to your music in order on the computer, whereas on here, you have to listen to them on shuffle. Overall, great app.
Love this app
It‚Äôs so good I use it all the time buuuuuuuut I wish you didn‚Äôt have to pay $9 a month for premium, I wish they could make it so you buy it till next year and have to but premium again. Please make it happen.
I‚Äôm happy! Older non-tech/app person who found Spotify due to Michelle Obama‚Äôs Valentine list for Barack.
I love Spotify!! Use it daily. ^.^
Ok Better if you can choose your own music with out having to pay for premium
Love the app
It's great but once you add a song to your playlist you can't delete it
This is so awesome
Love this service!
I‚Äôve been wanting to listen to new music lately and new bands and this is the perfect tool to do so. Check it out!
The shuffle button doesn‚Äôt work properly when you have a lot of songs
I have bought and downloaded multiple music apps and this is the best by far, with the free price and availability of all the music you can think of I really recommend this app!
This app will take around the world back and forth in minutes, any music genres Not A Problem! Just amazing music.
Love it ! That‚Äôs awesome
It‚Äôs free music which I like, but if I play a playlist that‚Äôs particularly short then basically every other song you play a song that‚Äôs not apart of a playlist and is only similar by being in the same genre. It should be so that if you are playing a playlist that it plays every song and then once it‚Äôs done it starts cherry picking songs that are preferably more similar.
It has a nice selection
It used to be great then something Happened. This beeping noise came on every time I wanted to listen to music. Because I don‚Äôt have premium it plays suggested songs that I hate and don‚Äôt even get to listen to my music by the time I use all the skips. IF YOUR NOT GETTING PREMIUM DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!! This is a app where u have to pay to get good things like your music! 
Nice ui
I love the chillax
The best has all the songs I likeüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
Great app!
This is a very very great app to use to listen to your music
I like the app with a couple exceptions. It would be nice if I could sort my playlists by A-Z or other sorting capability. Basically it could use some work...
Hi
Spotify is the best all you have to pay is like  five dollars each month unlimited songs and what ever song you want I love it so much
Better selection of playlists than other music apps.
La mejor aplicaci√≥n de m√∫sica que existe!
It‚Äôs great, very great, and it‚Äôll be a lot better if there‚Äôs a feature where we get notifications whenever a certain artist releases a song
I love music. Spotify loves music. Blah, blah, blah. Happily ever after. 
Could be better if we could make our own playlist and the artist we want to listen to for free instead of have to pay for it
La mejor app de m√∫sica del mundo
Great app!
Love this station
So much better than other music apps!
It‚Äôs awesome
Spotify is a God send for small store owners. I love it. Love the choices. When no one‚Äôs around I listen to opera then I switch to normal choices. I love this app. The best for me! Chef Fran‚Äôs Kitchenware in Jamesport
Love!!
Like the ‚ÄúBunny‚Äù (Keeps running)  I challenge anyone to find a better selection. Great Stuff! There‚Äôs has been NOTHING I searched for, Spotify doesn‚Äôt have.  (So far, but I search for some long-lost stuff, and they STILL to have it stored on their servers.)  Great Stuff! 
I love this
to many ads !!! I just want to hear my music!!!! Premium is TOO expensive !! I‚Äôm a teenager for God‚Äôs sake, I just want to listen to my music with the ability of unlimited skips, NO ads, and no random music playing when I‚Äôm trying to listen to MY music choices !! Like honestly, I‚Äôm sick of Spotify. I started using it when I was in 6th grade when people started to, and let me say UGHHHH. Like there‚Äôs lots of music choices but that doesn‚Äôt make it worth it. Yet I still use it, I don‚Äôt know where else to go !!! For music!! PLEASE SPOTIFY JUST DROP PREMIUM LET EVERYONE LISTEN TO MUSIC!! when they say ‚Äúnow enjoy 30 mins of ad free music, ‚ÄúITS NOT FOR 30 mins!! It‚Äôs for like 15 mins NOT 30 ! jeeeeeezzzz. Like I should already have 30 mins of ad free music without having to listen to ads after every song. Like Spotify even needs the money from selling ads. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ugh ok, I‚Äôm done.
I mean , it ain‚Äôt all that ü§£ but the only app I listen to music on üíõüíõüíõüíõ
Spotify is my spirit animal.
Mate this is amazing
Didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like it, turned out to be awesome
This app keeps say error when signing up .....

I used to use Spotify a lot but now it sometimes doesn‚Äôt even play the song you want without Spotify premium it instead plays suggested songs which makes playing Spotify at parties or events much harder. I‚Äôd suggest if you use Spotify that you buy premium it‚Äôs in turn a much better experience.
Great
Love the many options!
Reaaalllly like it so far ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
Dope
You should make it to where we can listen without internet bc that would be amazing and I wanna delete this app bc u need internet for it
Love itüòç‚ù§Ô∏è
This app is really good you get all the music you want anytime you want
Love Spotify. Great app all around
This app is amazing
All my favorite music in one place! I recommend this app to everyone.
Have been using it for years! Awesome service :)
I love the family plan. I had the single plan but I was constantly fighting over control with my 11 year old daughter. Family plan rocks
Its nice i tell ya
Love it so much!! Easy and free!!
Love that I could find so many songs from my past!
Very good app
Love it!
So many songs available to you. I especially like how easy it is to add a song to your library.
I Highly recommend this app. It has everything
Word
This app is so good you can remove adds for only 12 dollar a month
THIS APP IS SO AMAZING! It is easy to use and very worth the premium price!
Love it
I am one of those music lovers used to purchase songs and albums rather than streaming them. Still in the transition, but enjoying Spotify in the meantime. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever stop purchasing songs, as it has its perks, but Spotify is definitively a good way to discover new music and to try a song before purchasing it. 
i love this soo much it is the most trustworthy music app üòÇüòÇ
I like it
Good selection of artists and songs. User interface is not bad.
Spotify rocks!!!
I love spotify so much, I use it everyday!
good
The best of the best
I love it
Found this app through a music app search and tried it. Have been listening ever since!! pretty awesome
Well this is amazing but 10 bucks a month is overpriced it only needs to be one to three bucks people need Money for more than just music
Changed for the worse. Sorry, I‚Äôm out. The previous review says it all
Recomemdada
This made me stop listening to pandora.
I love Spotify, but there are a few songs and artists that are not available I don‚Äôt know why.
I used to not be able to listen to music when I wanted to for FREE, because who wants to always pay for something. Especially since my last music app only gave me a three month free trial and ended quickly.Spotify has been my instrumental hero, I would recommend it to all my family and friends!
It‚Äôs good and music is perfect and on style but whenever u make a playlist it doesn‚Äôt play anything like that music or any of the music in the playlist.
It is expensive; however, Spotify enables you to do so much with it. Radio and downloadable playlists? Yes please!
Free features feel like premium features
Love this better than Apple Music or Pandora! The only thing missing is the album Eternal Nightmare by Vio-lence!
Best media player around! Computer listening is the best but mobile is great too!! Love!!!
I‚Äôve had the app ever since I was in 6th grade and y‚Äôall haven‚Äôt disappointed me I like the app but longer free trial
I love listening to music while playing games.
I‚Äôve tried a number of music apps and Spotify is by far my favorite. I simply have to search for whatever artist of album I want to hear and more than likely its there. Sure there are some artists you can‚Äôt find, but with all the other options and playlists you won‚Äôt miss those artists much. One of my favorite features is the Discover Daily playlists. Every time I want to hear something different I go to one of those discover playlists and always find a new song or artist to get addicted to. Top that off with good sound quality and a reasonable monthly price.
Love it
Love it
The paid service is great, but you need to be careful of live versions if you are not a fan. There are many.
Love this but I wish you could skip more songs
I love Spotify but I wish that monthly it didn't cost 9.99 and there were more deals
This app has it all from choosing the genres of music you like to  listen to you to playing your favorite hits. It‚Äôs the best app for music, And the best app to listen to music on. You could even show you some songs that you may want to listen to, Show you the top hundred billboard and the  top 50 out of state Billboard hits. I think this app is amazing because it plays the  music I like ,and I get to listen to new music hits every day.
What does it say when you open the jazz section and you see Frank Sinatra, Billie Holiday and Louis Armstrong? Either really, really old people, or Europeans who never caught up to bebop, hardbop, post-bop, cool jazz, funk jazz und so weiter
This app is amazing love it so much
Love it!
I ‚ù§Ô∏è it!
Best music app ever.
What else needs to be said!
Ever. I've used them all. This is worth every penny
This app is amazing,and I have a few suggestions for this wonderfully amazing app!First,can you fix the bug for when you add the same song to the Queue while it‚Äôs playing.Ok,so I just found this,and when I was playing NO NAME by NF that I added to one of my playlists,I tried to add it to my queue a few times so that it could play multiple times,and when I did this,as soon as the song was over and went to the next,(since it was the same song,it started from where the last one ended.So basically adding the same song to the queue while it‚Äôs playing glitches the next song cause the next song starts where the last one ended.Second,could you please add it to where the iPhone or phone users could pick any song on their playlists.I have a phone,but I mostly use my tablet for the music.I have the premium for my apple tablet but it‚Äôs really hard listening to music on the go unless you have a bag or something.It would be nice to pick any song for phone users.Please fix these,but if not being able to pick a certain song for phone users without having premium is your plan,then you can keep it,but can u fix the first bug please.Thank You So Much,And I love this app.Also,Pretty soon,if it‚Äôs not TOO hard,can you make and amazing update,like a big one.But so far I like it how it is now.Ive had this app forever and it‚Äôs amazing.If you read this,please put this to mind,but if it‚Äôs too much,then can u fix the first bug I mentioned?Thank You and keep up the good work!‚ù§Ô∏èCan you write back to me soon so I could know please?I know I can‚Äôt be one of you specifically,but I am the BIGGEST fan of this app!I can‚Äôt stop going on it.It is probably the most used thing on my phone and tablet!EVEN MORE THAN YOUTUBE!I just want to ask if I can be part of your crew for thinking of new ideas.That would be amazing to help you think of new ways to update your app or just suggestions.Please write back to me as soon as possible.Please reply and tell me if I could.It would be literally a DREAM come true.Thank You for reading,and please reply back.üòä(side note) Thank You for making this app and changing my life,and it has always been a dream of mine to help the owner(s) of this app.I would like to have a conversation about this talk PLEASE.Can we please chat about this.THANK YOU‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíõ
No issues! Love jamming out while working on Saturday!
I love Spotify because it‚Äôs really easy to use and haves a lot of music
Better interface in my opinion, easy use, doesn‚Äôt complicate deleting songs with ‚Äúclouds‚Äù. When I want to clean up my library I am able to without old songs reappearing automatically
I love music. Who doesn‚Äôt. All the songs I enjoy are available and I am discovering new music. Pair Spotify with good speakers (Sonos is what I use) and you are ready for hours of listening pleasure.
I do enjoy the great selection and variety of songs available.
Spotify is a great app to listen to music on. There are less ads than pandora.
This app is good,all songs aren‚Äôt on here though for some artists
Perfecto
I love this app!!üòÇüòÇüòç
So I love the app but I wish they would bring back the preview for the songs you want to hear but besides that it's an amazing app.
My favorite for music. 30 minutes ad free is great for workouts.
This app is a good app for songs but it does not work as well for YouTube it does not play the same song you put it will play a other song before
Really great make your playlist and listen to anybody or anything you want to Really good only a little bit of ads and not offline but you have to pay monthly wish it was just one time pay
This is the Best app I know THANK YOU SPOTIFY! P.S.  üòÅüëçüî•üéßüî•üòé P.P.S Follow me on Snapchat jmac_290 
Cool to hear so many options. However one issue I start hearing my Christian music option in a hip-hop genre and after three or four cool christian songs then it switches to secular hiphop not cool!
Best music app. Period.
Love being able to skip or replay certain songs. I love this app.
The app is good but I don't really understand the whole concept just yet. I have to fiddle through with the application a little more. Overall, it's a good application, just a little confusing for myself (a beginner).
I've never had issues with the app and I pay 9.99 a month for the premium and it's absolutely worth it. Wouldn't go to any other place for music.
At first I didn‚Äôt think much of Spotify. But, turns out, it‚Äôs got everything you want. For example, I‚Äôve heard people saying that Spotify makes you pick what songs you want to listen to, but with other apps like Pandora, you get to discover new music. However, you can also get radio stations on Spotify and it gives you recommendations based on the music in your playlists. It also has podcasts and pre-made playlists created by other users that you might like. One concern however, the creators should slow down with the ads. Of course, it‚Äôs not as many as other music apps, but they are bothersome, and I would like to see less of them. Spotify is the best music app out there, and I 100% recommend it.
Los mejores....#jesuseselcentro
Any artist, song, or album they have it I listen to this when I work or text! This app is incredible
I love it!üíû
It is the best in the world
Really disappointed they don‚Äôt have this app to work on the Apple Watch
For a great app
Absolutely love this app
Great so far üòÑüòâ
I love how the music is so flawless without no glitches
The best
Wish it had more skips than pandora and played more popular songs during the shuffle play
Even though I graduated from college lost my premium discount, I don't mind paying the full monthly fee FOR PREMIUM whatsoever. I have no idea why anyone would use a music app, free or otherwise, rather than Spotify. It lays all cards out on the table. You definitely get what you pay for. I can't attest to the free version, though, as I've almost never used it. - A Spotify premium user for about 5 years now. 
You can try and make it so you can play any song and Spock songs ! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Love it
The layout is better, more accessible on other devices. Just great!
Great selection. Very user friendly.
Good
Sometimes the songs are not what I would expect to be recommended but most of the time it finds new songs for me that I enjoy
Brutal
Amazing
Best music appüíï
I‚Äôve been using Spotify for so long and is still my favorite app for listening to music. All of my favorite songs are available on Spotify . The only thing I wish was included was offline music so we can listen to music anytime!!!
Great selection of tunes for me. Like the mix. Better than radio!
Hi
Good stuff
Fun
For Christmas this year I got a subscription to Spotify Premium. It‚Äôs really nice to have, but there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôd like to change. Please allow me to change playlist covers on mobile. I‚Äôve tried to on desktop and I can‚Äôt get the mobile app to run. Just make it easy on us and let us do it on mobile please and thank you.
I don't have Apple Music this fixes that!üòÄ
I switched over from Pandora to Spotify and I like Spotify better. Good worküëç
I don‚Äôt even know why I didn‚Äôt as paying 10 dollars a month for Apple Music. Spotify has everything.
I have compared Spotify with Apple Music service and I still prefer the user interface found in spotify.  It is the best music app for me, for now.
I just wish Spotify would post more of the user requests on the app, because there are a few gospel songs I would enjoy listening to in high quality.
But the ads lie about 30 free minutes
Great music for everyone
Like the playlists
Premium is definitely worth it üëåüèª
If you love music, you need this app!!!
Music keeps flowing gr8
The best music app that I've ever see and use
This is a great service to discover new music. I wish you could import libraries from other users or from other services. I have a friend's entire library I would like to import, and can't. I have come across a few tracks that are damaged, but I get a quick response when I report it. Their ads are not obnoxious, and they are tolerable. Overall good service except for the library import issue. They have workarounds for playlists, but it's not the same.
Down rite awesome
Has every song I love
I love Emma chamberlain
It‚Äôs awesome
This is a great app for Music give it five stars you‚Äôll love it just try it
They good
I have been in love with Spotify for a long time. However, it‚Äôs been hard listening to some of my favorites songs at work because there is no option to turn off explicit tracks. Pandora has this option and it‚Äôs awesome. Even if I put songs into a playlist that I think don‚Äôt have curse words in them, I inevitably fail and end up skipping songs again and again.
Spotify is my favorite music app, definitely worth the monthly fee, it is very organizable and I love the systems and playlist options. Thousands of Music selections for everyone
Kinko foreign my name
I love that I can listen to other music them what I have on my iPod. Great job guys and gals
I used it for a few days and then I didn‚Äôt use it for 2 months I think. Today I wanted to use it and listen to some music and It said I have to log in and I entered my email and password but it says YoU cAn OnLy UsE SpOtIfY aBrOaD fOr 14 dAyS  What the hell Does it mean????? I‚Äôm gonna delete this app right nowüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª 
Could you please implement the function to sort newly added songs in alphabetical order??   But with also keeping the original form when they get added to the bottom in case people forget the name but know they added it recently so it‚Äôll be easier to find songs. A lot of convenience if that can happen!!?? Love the app though, thank you. 
Not disappointed at all! All my searches and results have been great. Perfect for any time!
Good
I feel like some of the Premium options should be in the Regular class. For example, every song in ur custom playlist shouldn't play any other ‚Äúsuggested tunes‚Äù. Thats the only change I would make
AMAZING &U CAN FIND ALL THE MUSIC U WANT & LOVE
Very large music library.
Great app easy to use, love the way you can download songs with premium
I have an insatiable appetite for music. There is a song and a genre begging to be compiled into a playlist. No matter how bizarre or unique the taste in vocals, Spotify is the community to help you scratch that itch. You will find everything from your great grandparents wedding songs to the latest and greatest up and coming artist. I love that I get notifications of new music and compilations based on other songs and artists I like. I depend on my subscription to Premium to carry me through my days. I can travel the world in 80 minutes with Spotify.
Its great
Great
It is a nice music application üëç
Been using it.
Love it! No complaints at all the only suggestion I would make is that they organize your library like Rdio
Spotify is a great app where you listen to music and I love itttüíïüíï But it has TOO MANY ADDS
Plays sings I don‚Äôt even have on my playlist randomly from the ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù list Please do remove this feature I‚Äôd make it an option 
Best interface but needs hi end sound quality options. Its crazy that it has taken this long!
Recently got Spotify when I switch to android. I DON‚ÄôT KNOW WHY IT TOOK ME THIS LONG TO GET IT! I love this music app!!
Wonderful to listen to after a hard day.
Great app
I can play it unlimited wherever i go soooo epic
Latest update breaks Sonos. Starts playing then crashes out but music keeps playing but you can‚Äôt control.
Pretty good
The audio quality and UI is Superb.
Awesome I love it
Spotify is really good
I wanted to buy presale tickets to a concert but never got a code sent to me and Spotify says I don‚Äôt listen to enough music. I use the app literally every day for 40,000 minutes a year (almost 30 days non stop) and they say ‚Äúnot enough‚Äù. They‚Äôve lost my business which was multiple accounts. Don‚Äôt waste time here.
I give you guys 5 stars!
my shittt
Great
I wish the trial could last more
Awesome to exercise too and music is different between my own and the radio!  Thanks Starbucks for offering this App!
I‚Äôve been using Spotify for so long and when I see my friends still using pandora I laugh. Spotify makes other apps look badüòÇ #spotifyforlife2k18
I absolutely love my Spotify!!
Amazing like everything in this universe! 19
Wish there was a slightly bigger variety difference for some artists like Snow Tha Product
Why can we not up or down grade discover weekly like we can on the computer?
Enjoying this option
Soooooo good
Wish their was more variety in browse... although there's a lot. I love looking for new music upbeat ... or whatever.... idk not saying it's not good.. but rather not manly always.. I'm a guy and would like to not listen to smoochy things idk if this is a reasonable review but there are many playlists I still like. Maybe a categorization between edm artists.. chill or whatever... maybe categorize it by instrumen... love Spotify overall though literally a ton of music I could think of just wish the browsing was more manly idk haha take it with a grain of salt.
I am an avid jazz listener and Spotify I say is the best source for jazz. Love it and I get all of my favorite jazz artists at the palm of my hand and the tip of my fingers! Thanks for such a great app. Saves me the hassle of caring 35 cd albums on trip back in the day!! üòÄüëèüëèüëç
I‚Äôd like to be able to search genres in my saved music.
I want to get a free trial but everytime I skip to many and the thing shows up, it doesn‚Äôt give me an option for the free trial or to buy premium.
For some reason, Spotify won't play my entire library when shuffling. It will only shuffle one letter at a time. Frustrating when you're paying for premium.
Muy muy bueno me gusta mucho
I love this app
It gives you 30 minutes of free music and you can add a playlistq
This app comes in handy when you don‚Äôt like no one at your school. You just simply plug your headphones in and listen to whatever you want commercial free. When people approach me I just go in this app and listen to sza really loud and pretend I don‚Äôt hear them calling me. This app is so awesome like come on ever song plus playlist from some pretty cool people. I‚Äôm enjoying ignoring all them basic people at my school listening to my Spotify app. So why y‚Äôall complaining this is AMAZING‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è
A+
M√∫sica descargada , se puede usar sin internet üëçüèª
I can make my own playlist and listen to all of them
Love it
Excelente!
After a few several years of using Spotify, and having tried Rdio, Mog, Beats, now Apple Music, I can confidently say that Spotify has the most user-friendly interface and it‚Äôs new music suggestions are spot on.
Good
Spotify is my favorite form of social media and it makes my life better. It provides a way for me to listen to what I love, discover a whole new world of music, and share as well as receive that love with others.  Bless Spotify üíõ 
I love this app and so will others
The most functional music app ever created I listen to it with my PS4 too nice move there Spotify Well Played ü•Ç
What‚Äôs the point of it if you can‚Äôt choose the song you want. I don‚Äôt wanna just press shuffle play everytime. I‚Äôd rather go to SoundCloud because they actually let you choose certain songs for free.
If you like a song then you could save it and then I will go straight to your music
Spotify is awesome except the paying but its awesome
Indeed
Love love love
I‚Äôve been a Spotify listener for about 7 years now, and I am absolutely obsessed. I listen to it every day, and the app is so easy and confirming to use. 10/10 would recommend over anything else.
Love the app!
A lil dropouts but everything else is good
Great radio like app I love the Country by the grace of God station it‚Äôs fabulous! God is so good! God bless you all. Jesus Loves You xoxo
I just started using this app and so far I have liked everything about it!
Just let me listen to one song without buying premium. I‚Äôm using Musi.
Worth the money
I am 68 years old. I love Spotify and make playlists.
Great music, not many ads.
Best experience among all music apps I ever used. Absolutely!
Love Spotify it gives me free music, LOVE IT!
Good
no other words
Great app. The ads are annoying, but tolerable. However, how come some albums and songs are missing from some artists?
I don‚Äôt ask much outta a streaming service all i wanted was a shuffle that doesn't only take a portion of the songs i have saved and then proceeds to auotplay whatever label is paying you the most.
SPOTIFY IS LITERALLY MY LIFE
This app is just all around the best!
I listen to music all the time so awesome can‚Äôt stop I can text and let stem to music at the same timeüò±
HOW DO I GET PREMIUM???????????I DONT KNOW HOW ON IOS!!!!!!
My suggestion for an improvement would be the ability to see/search for the playlists you have downloaded. I save/download playlists that aren't my own so I do.t know if they're taking up room on my phone if I'm not listening to them.
Forget all others. Spotify premium is where it‚Äôs at
I have been using this app for years! And every time I use I am reminded of how great it is and how I am able to share playlist and music with my friends and family. I also think that the family version is also better than other apps.  Thanks for creating this app and I can‚Äôt wait for thing to come.
Honestly, having all of my music in one place is great. But just make the ‚Äúsuggested music‚Äù thing an optional thing. Every other song, I get TWO of them. two suggested song per normal song. I can‚Äôt skip em, and I can‚Äôt listen to my music because of this. It‚Äôs there money grab for premium to get ‚Äúunlimited skips. Don‚Äôt buy unless otherwise.
Love making playlists and saves in various music gendres !!!!!
Nice...
I love this app
I'm a music lover, I bought the biggest memory phone to hold music. Now I have all the music I want!
I usually delete and get back Spotify. But I notice how different Spotify is from the other music apps. I just love it NOW. All I listen too is all my Mexican music. No English üòò LOVE YOU SPOTIFY. Keep making us happy. Don‚Äôt do weird ugly updates. Make it simple and easy for others
Found everything I ever wanted to listen to!!
Spotify have al kind of music
just listen and enjoy your life with spotify :)
All good !!
I still like Pandora a lot better.
I‚Äôve had some troubles getting iTunes to play nice with all of my devices (inexplicably, most of which are Apple). After deciding I don‚Äôt want to pay another $9.99/month for Apple Music I noticed many friends were happily using Spotify and no longer buying music. I always felt that I needed to ‚Äúpossess‚Äù the music that I owned but I‚Äôm now fairly convinced my notions of music ownership are dated like my notions of movie ownership back when I thought it made good sense to buy and keep DVDs forever, but now we have Netflix and I think Spotify is the Netflix of music. They have promotions that bring down the avg monthly cost below $9.99 which seems to be the market rate for music. Give it a try and discover what your friends are listening to.
Muy buena aplicaci√≥n
It‚Äôs litüî•üî•üî•
I love how Spotify doesn‚Äôt just notify me of new music from my fave artists, but also suggests new artists and music genres for me to listen to.  It really broadens my music knowledge and keeps my playlists from becoming monotonous!  Keep up the good work. :-)
Just signed up today and so far so good
So good and you get a free 1 week premium trial and when it‚Äôs over it doesn‚Äôt charge you!!!
Nice

Unlimited skips wouldn‚Äôt hurt:(
A great big collection of music. Will suggest music similar to the playlist I‚Äôm trying to make. Super app, but a subscribing is best way to experience.  Works best on my iPad.
...
This is awesome I love this app and music like this is the best.
I‚Äôve had Spotify for quite some time and it was great, was. Now they force you to pay for premium. I can‚Äôt listen to the song I want, but I can on my laptop??? Please make it worthwhile and entertaining like it used to be and maybe I‚Äôll download it again.
Most used app in my life
I love love love the ability to find new music and make playlists/ follow others.
The only thing I use for music.
I was feeling 100% about this app until I purchased my iPad Pro & realized I cannot listen to podcasts on that device, only my iPhone.  I searched the Spotify community forums for a solution & this has been an issue for at least a few years.  With so many updates & ‚Äúbug fixes‚Äù this shouldn‚Äôt be an issue at all.  I should be able to listen to everything Spotify has to offer no matter the device, especially since I‚Äôm paying for it monthly.  I‚Äôm struggling between a 2 & 3 star rating, this is very upsetting.
Great sound, huge selection, and easy to use! Plus, the playlists are awesome.
I do have the paid family plan and we all love it.
Spotify is easier to use and find what you want to listen to than other music apps that are reasonably priced. I love to make playlists and find playlists with already great songs. No ads if you buy a subscription but I feel like I get my money's worth!
Awesome
We need to pay the artists and love them as Spotify gets us to love them also

This app is the best music app I‚Äôve used so far.
How did I ever live without Spotify???
i love this app
Keeps adding random songs I do not have on my playlist. Also will not allow me to cancel premium subscription. Their instructions are clear, but the cancellation button they speak of does not exist.
so many playlists to choose from..with a crazy variety of playlist categories!..new..to throwback hits..this app has everything!
OMG! This is the best app it allows you to listen your own music and you don‚Äôt even have to get out of the app! I will say that you have to be a member to have unlimited skips so I wish you can maybe fix something like you have 10 skips until you use them all or something any I totally recommend this if you love listening to your own music! ‚ù§Ô∏èüéµ
Whether you go with the ads or ad-free, I love that Spotify can let me and my friends share music and playlists, without expensive memberships.
Good
Nice
Way better than Apple Music. Best music streaming app hands down.
Made my life better.
Great app, better then Apple Music
I dislike how it changes to music outside of the playlist I make.it annoys me because I don‚Äôt know the song half the time and I don‚Äôt up liking some.if u could,I would like if you‚Äôd remove the recommended music stuff off unless we can skip it.thats all my ranting,good job.
please spotify your ad revenue would go way up cause everyone would watch the adds
Worth the ten, bout no more then that
From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same... My partner, my companion.
Utilizei o aplicativo por aproximadamente um ano (conta Premium) sem nenhum tipo de interrup√ß√£o, j√° possu√≠a v√°rias playlists e √°lbuns baixados no meu celular. Por√©m, do nada, o Ebanx que gerencia o pagamento do aplicativo Spotify parou de efetuar as cobran√ßas em meu cart√£o de cr√©dito, e isso perdura por mais de 3 meses sem conseguir resolver o problema. Enfim, Spotify diz que o problema √© com o Ebanx e vice-versa, e at√© ent√£o nada de resolver o problema... ou seja, tempo perdido j√° que todas as playlists e √°lbuns se tornaram in√∫teis, pois √© imposs√≠vel utilizar o aplicativo no modo Free (extremamente limitado). Aguardando resolu√ß√£o do problema!
I enjoy this app
Had Spotify since the beginning and always loved it.
Sound rocks
love it!
I‚Äôm enjoying the different playlists, new music, it gets me through the work day!
This is the go to App for all of my music needs!
Finding all my jams
Really hard to write a review just yet. I do like it sometimes, other days so so. I guess because it‚Äôs free we will be bombarded with ads. So until I reach my threshold of ‚Äúfree‚Äù I‚Äôll listen then move on.
I love Spotify it‚Äôs the highlight of my day when I can just jam out to my favorite songs. I definitely recommend it and if you don‚Äôt get it your crazy.
Dope app!!!
Best software it has every song from my grown up t'ill this day and all the types of songs all i mean is that this is the best think u can get in this life
Wasn‚Äôt sure how much I‚Äôd use this but I love that they have such a great playlist of Supernatural based songs I can listen to for hours!
Wonderful song
I love being able to personalize what I want to listen to along with my moods.
this is awesome and is free i used this when i was going on vacation 5 stars
Whenever I listen to music with my earbuds it always makes the singers voice really low.
Kool and the gang
Godd
THIS US THE BEST MUSIC PLAYING APP EVER XD
Amo esta app! Mucho! Mucho! Hay un mont√≥n de m√∫sica cristiana para adorar! Wohoooo!!
Awesome
Great music, more genres than I can ever listen too. Thanks Spotify!
I enjoy the variety of music selections.
Spotify is the best üôåüèªüéâ love it!! I can listen to all my jamz
The shuffle used to work fine before but lately I only hear small subsets of my music. A large playlist will only shuffle through about 50-100 songs before restarting those same songs. I pay for premium but the shuffle technology is beyond worthless. This completely ruins my music experience and requires me to manually choose songs. I might as well go back to iTunes if this isn't addressed soon.
I can have my google mini play my playlist with my voice, that alone is great, but it also give me tips during the ads on more features I can use, just wish I could hand select songs sometimes but I also wish I was a size 3 and neither one of those things is going to happen
Amazing music gallery great app. Love the discover weekly playlist.
I love using this app. It‚Äôs Lit! Need a little more updates on older original songs
Grateful when my son taught me how to use this app I get to customize my playlists, our church created it's own playlist of the worship music we sing... Helps me get through daily choresüòälove it!
It would help if you could tell us what each update did or changed!!
Super nice!!!!
THIS US AMAZING!!!!
I don‚Äôt like how i have to upgrade just to pick a song I want to listen to at that moment
Best music app Im so happy for using spotify but sometimes when I swipe right a song it doesnt add to queue please make this right
The Spotify is l like it easy using
Awesome
This app is awesome I‚Äôm done that‚Äôs it
Love this music app.
Thanks!
I used Pandora for over 10 years, and Spotify came and changed the music game! Spotify keeps up to date with Artists and releases, always delivering the newest music right away, unlike some other competitors. Their library is ever expanding with older ep‚Äôs and albums, so the nostalgia is always rocking! It definitely has a learning curve, and you discover that everyone uses Spotify differently, depending on how you music! Playlisters are in paradise, new music junkies are always in for a delectable treat, and audiophiles are right where they need to be. If you want to listen to the same song over and over, this is your jam. If you want to listen to the same music over and over without control, go back to Pandora. If you want to be excited about your station then you‚Äôve found your new best friend. üíúüíö
My millennial made me install on my phone and it‚Äôs fun to explore and listen to different playlists.
Doesn‚Äôt use up that much data.
It‚Äôs a good app to just listen to music for free.
It‚Äôs very user friendly and easy to access on many different devices.
I love it
Truly enjoy the options that Spotify offers to explore new groups and types of music.... hours of enjoyment!
I LOVE THIS APP
Good
This has gotten me listening to music again. Easy to use and a great way to discover new artists.
I wish I would‚Äôve found this app a long time ago. Bye Pandora!!
Perfect music app
Best ever would cry if something happened to Spotify
Excellent, everything about it!
Yes plz
I started using Spotify on my PS4 about a year ago.  It is easy to use, you can find about any song you want to, and if you don‚Äôt like an ad after every couple of songs, it‚Äôs really easy to use the Premium free trial or buy Premium.
i really like the app. well no dur if i gave it 5 stars but i‚Äôm just doing this review for skips so hehe
This is a review of Spotify‚Äôs release notes:  ‚Ä¢ They are bad and Spotify doesn‚Äôt care 
So convenient and has all the songs I love!
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
So far it has more music of an artist that I listen to that I can add to a playlist! I love that unlike some that may or may not have any at all.
It's. Straight. üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
Super great app. Music your way.
Great
Great App highly recommended they have all my favorite music!:)
Esta con todo el Espotifay!!!!
It always plays what i like. I love it way more than Apple Music. I find it hard to use Apple Music and play the music I like.
Pongan a RBD eso bai todo lo otro es bueno ‚ù§Ô∏è
I‚Äôve only had amazing things to say to everyone I know about Spotify
:)
This is not cool. Forces me to try the premium version, not cool.
Amazing app
Jus perfect for a wide variety of music
Can you please make a way to transfer a playlist to someone else‚Äôs account. I used to use my mom‚Äôs and my friend‚Äôs old accounts and now i have my own but my playlist are still on their accounts. I know you can make it collaborative but a lot of people like my music so if it‚Äôs collaborative then it can‚Äôt be public and if they scan the code then they can add music which i don‚Äôt want, i just want them to be able to follow and take music from my playlist to theirs. It‚Äôd be a lot easier if you can just transfer the old account‚Äôs playlist. I love everything else about Spotify premium though.
Finally an app that allows me to listen to my music from my favourite bands from Qu√©bec, Canada.
Enjoying much!
Great app. Over the years this app has improved the most. Simple to use and hardly ever any interruptions. Also great for see what your friends are listening to.
Live it
I use this more than my music app. I never use the music app that my iPhone came with.
Love it
you can literally listen to basically any song for free and you can save your favorite songs in your own play list
few bugs but this is the best music app especially when you have premium.
Lit
Best app ever!!! Love it
Spotify is so great because the app is friendly and every kind of music is on Spotify and you don‚Äôt have to pay for music so I think it‚Äôs worth it üëë
Love Spotify, but the app is not good. I‚Äôm constantly seeing different bugs, including:  -‚ÄúRepeat Track‚Äù randomly turning on at times  -App interface on the lock screen showing 0:00 during a song that‚Äôs playing -Randomly plays songs in extreme fast forward -Apple CarPlay functionality could use some work  Also please give us a way to downvote/hide stuff on the Release Radar! 
Easy
I‚Äôve tried Apple, Amazon and Pandora. Spotify is without compare.   Forget the rest. This is the best!!!! 
This is a wonderful app!
Hi
It‚Äôs a really good app and I recommend it to others‚ò∫Ô∏è
Spotify has to be the best music out wish I had money so I could get premium
Great playlist and introduction to new music plus artist.
Love all the freshly designed playlists
I luv dis app but u guys needa cut d ads...
I see no problem with the service. I enjoy the variety of music from the service.
There is no phone support,so if you have a problem with email address etc there is no way to notify them with credit card changes
Premium or not, I‚Äôve had an amazing experience on Spotify and recommend that if you don‚Äôt have premium you should try it out, it‚Äôs so much cheaper than paying $12 for ONE album on iTunes, for ten dollars a month you can have every released album that you want, one hundred percent recommend and can‚Äôt wait for Ariana Grande‚Äôs fourth studio album to be released so I can stream it 24/7 on my favorite app(Spotify)
I love him I can get all my songs for only 10 dollars a months!!
Spotify is the best mmmmaaaaannnnnnn
I love creating my own playlists!
Spotify is my new home - NA$TY MF
Everything is fine but sometimes it undownloads songs
You have a playlist right? Well, why can‚Äôt I tap on the songs on my playlist to play without having to download Premium? Why can‚Äôt I just tap on a song and listen to it?
Hello creators Spotify thank you for your app it is the best ever (Better than Pandora, don‚Äôt tell them I said that) I rate you 5 huge stars for your app üëçüëçü§ó
Good app
Just what you expect from a music streaming app, no bugs and no crash (at least for me).   5/5 
It‚Äôs been than expected
Thanks for the awesome great mix. Where have I been all this time?
It's really awesome being able to share playlists with friends
Great music service
Amazing, love it my to go every where
amazing
Amazing speed
I enjoy Spotify especially now that I can sync my Shazam tags ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèº
I‚Äôve had this app for a couple years now, it still amazes me how good it is. Even without premium its still good. The choices of songs are huge, and they are great quality as well. I can‚Äôt ask for anything more from Spotify.
It has every thing (and more) that I would ever want to listen to! I love that it gets to know the genres I like most and suggest new stuff I would probably miss otherwise!
Have recommend to family and friends
Dope I like it
Its 2018. People expect transparency with software updates. Please catch up with the rest and get with the program. We love your app but we want to get excited about all of your improvements.
I can listen to my music any we‚Äôre and if you buy premium u can have all the skips you and song u want love this App
Awesome app
You can find any song that you want and it has a variety of music genres.
Please add Apple Watch support.
Just started listening to Spotify. So much better than Pandora. I don't have to run into the computer and click ok when it ask "are you still listening". It's a pain to do that when your working
Love it
Should give 5 free months but dope app
Easy to navigate, endless selection, and higher quality without waiting for something to load.
I have no complaints. My husband has the premium version and I hijacked it from it. My only request on improvement is to add a ‚Äúgenre‚Äù row to how your music is organized.
Great playlists better interface than apple.
5out of five
That is all üëåüèæüòéüí™üèæüíØüéº
I lost my old account so had to make a whole new one thank god I can follow my old account cause I had a lot of songs and playlist.
I listen about 5 or 6 hours of music daily listening to what Spotify selects for me, they have always something great and new.  Also, the quality of the sound is very good. My playlists grow with amazing music and big fun.  Thank you :) 
Tried pandora did not like it. Spotify much better.
Very good
Getting better - like I can‚Äôt select 2 songs on my Playlist.   I‚Äôd keep adding not sure ya know have it 100.   Baget is fun so much. But not sure is that the software like Walk this Way (Aerosmith)   Sporpions: Wise Men say (Elvis) Walk this Way (Aerosmith)   Biggest icky- that Green Frisbee is ugly. Aerodynamic however but ugly so option not fact however.  I‚Äôm 49 so Who is your customer?  And what‚Äôs Popular Culture and simple and w/music theme - maybe not a Frisbee.  Customer will feel stressful BAD - Need beer and teenage room and bar and man caves ya know Genra Specificity like middle age old age the phone Shaggin‚Äô could be   Genra 
So easy to use. Search by song title or artist. Create your own playlists effortlessly.
Love it sooo much!!‚ù§Ô∏è
Eom
Best free music app, hassle free, much variety, much appreciation.
It rocks
Try it. You'll love it. Very complete app. Love it over Apple Music simply because you're still able to listen to music even if you don't pay premium. Apple blocks your playlist while Spotify is still usable.
Love it.
This is one of the best music apps you will ever find.
Nice look
I love this app!! We have the family plan and nobody fights over it anymoreüëç
I listen to Spotify every single day and love the app. Haven‚Äôt had any problems with it. Keep us the good work!
Hands down ü§≤üèºü§≤üèºü§≤üèºü§≤üèºü§≤üèæ best Music Streaming format !!!
Love it soo much I so suggest it
At first it was fine, but recently it hasn't been playing what I was asking it. It knew what I was saying
Seems better than iTunes-a decade+ customer. So far, it has an appetizing selection for FREE (most powerful word in the English language) and is fine by me.   Spotify‚Äôs platform dismisses the regimentation of iTunes. Regimentation. 
The best wish premium was free
Great selection and easy to use!
Great selection of music and very easy to use üòäüòä
The best music app in the entire App Store. I love it when it allows you download them and listen to them later offline, if you have premium. I highly recommend this music app.
Spotify premium is awesome because even when I have no service I have access to my music anywhere anytime.
I have been subscribed for over 2 years now. I would say Spotify is my favorite app out of all the music streaming services. They were also the first to allow you to download and play music in offline mode for people that don‚Äôt have good signal strength to still be able to listen to music. Also, I don‚Äôt normally review stuff but they are that good!
Seriously disappointed with the new Spotify mobile. I‚Äôm trying to listen to the playlists I‚Äôve saved or followed - I don‚Äôt want these random songs popping up out of nowhere every time (majority of which aren‚Äôt even in the same genre). It‚Äôs getting really frustrating. If i wanted this feature I‚Äôd just switch back to pandora.
This app it the best music app honestly!!
I
I love spotify! I use it every day. My one complaint is that account settings and features are hard to find or access if you‚Äôre  on mobile instead of desktop.
As title
Awesome possum
ITSSS A REALLY GREAT MUSIC APP I LOVE IT SOOOO MUCH AND I USE IT ALLL THE TIME
Really nice if u get premium its worth it
I like this app a lot an it‚Äôs lit
I prefer this over any music streaming app
Really enjoy being able to listen to whatever I want.
best song app
Spotify has alot more variety than other sites, and it‚Äôs easy to use..üòä
The lock screen widget doesn't work properly. It doesn't show track progress. When phone is connected to a dock changing the song makes apple music play.
Muy buena haplicasion
I pay $4.99 to have a useless app that literally buffers and says ‚Äúconnecting‚Äù all the time. Used to be great and I could actually listen to the music I‚Äôm paying for but I guess now I pay for a connecting screen. (And it‚Äôs definitely not my WiFi as I‚Äôve tried it with full bars and fast WiFi) 0/10!
This a great music experience no matter what your age!!
I use this as my main music service. I listen to abstract ska, punk, harder to find artists so awesome!
Let‚Äôs see how long the format and price stays the same or gets better now that M$ owns them...
is very good app
All the music you want for free. You can‚Äôt get any better than that when it comes to music lovers like me
Yeah
Great selection. Awesome quality. Best music streaming service around.
One essential app I need.
I love this app, just wish there were less ads and h could pick what song you want to hear, im broke and cant pay for premium lol
Easy to use, lots of options.
Please add tool. And more rock bands
Just using it for the first time and loving it üëçüèª
I'm an artist on this site and it has really helped my career. Great job Spotify! Let's grow!
Wish they had more underground music. But overall good appüëåüèº
I played song for me sang it
I want to play anything for free
Love Spotify ! Never crashes
Sweet App.
I love all the Spanish hit and old bachata üòçüíÆ
üëçüèª yep
It is better than pandora
Amazing
Great
I love it, and use it everyday, but please bring back the hands free driving mode.
So happy I decided to go with premium, will never go back to iHeart.
Give me More
I love this app
What even is Pandora or YouTub what even is Pandora or YouTube or
Good app needs more updates
I hardly recommend Spotify to ALL broadly Music Lovers
This app is so good! No issues
üëç
Any song from any era or genre...üò±üòéüòé
It‚Äôs good but I don‚Äôt like how there‚Äôs these coloms
Give me more
Great song selection and relevant variety. Five stars!!
While out on the lonely road weeks at a time, Spotify allows me to enjoy all my favorite composers and music eras: Mahler, Faur√©, Vaughan Williams along with Medieval, Baroque, Early Modern. Once I heeded my teenage daughter's advice and began listening to Spotify, I dropped that other music streaming service like a burnt match, the one named for that Greek gal who couldn't keep a lid on her curiosity,
Dumbest commercials ever. Geicos are the worst
I love Spotify. It has all the last and most popular songs. I‚Äôve never wanted to listen to a song that I didn‚Äôt find in Spotify.
They gave me two months free and the interface is easy to navigate through.
Perfecta  aplicaci√≥n la uso todos los d√≠as !!
Love this app!! I use it every day all day. It‚Äôs a little pricey for premium but obviously worth it cuz I end up getting it every month lol 
Love it!!!
Cool
Very nice !! Love it !
I have been searching for a perfect app to use and this is the only you can use to play instantly with out using skips like pandora and you can turn off your phone like YouTube.  Thank you Spotify.
I love Spotify. So much music, so many options for professionals or just music lovers. It has been a great tool for me, and a great way to reconnect with my favorite artists. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Great app!
issa great app 11/10
You play the artist that is asked for and not just related artists after one or two songs !
Pure geniuses the creators that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm gonna say
Recently, I‚Äôve noticed that the downloads category that used to be right in the ‚Äúyour library‚Äù tab is now gone. Instead, you now can only see downloads when tapping on ‚Äúplaylists‚Äù ‚Äúalbums‚Äù etc and filtering it to show only the downloaded content. I‚Äôm just curious if there‚Äôs a way to add back the subcategory for downloads that just showed everything on my account that was downloaded instead of having to filter some other subcategory? It used to be there, so I‚Äôm not sure if the new update removed it or if I turned something off, either way I would like it back.
I love the song selections
Downloading music takes a lot less space, if I had as many songs on there instead of Spotify downloaded, then I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do anything else on my phone except listen to music
Good app ig
Great
It‚Äôs lit
Its Spotify
Works better than pandora, I‚Äôll give it that. Still good though.
OMG I TRYING AND TRYING TO DO IT WHEN IM PLAYING GAMES CAN U do a update where u can hear music on any apps PLEASE
Love it!
U cheer me up
I‚Äôm having fun I just got it and haven‚Äôt found anything wrong w it yet
But to much adds
Better than expected.
Life changing. Why have we waited so long !?!  Highly recommend it for any music lover!
This is the best app because you can pick many divider to songs to listen to and it has the best songs that any app has had
Has everything
Spotify pretty tight my g can‚Äôt lie
Grat lyrics And upbeat with real drums!üëç
This app is the best thing I ever came across with. Im a premium user. Best part of it is being able to look for whatever artist or song your looking for and play it whenever you want and how many times you want. It is awesome!!!!!!üòÄ
^^^^
:)
The best way to find your music taste
I can‚Äôt get over how simple and user friendly this app is. All the music you could ever want too
Pretty good
üëçüèªbuen√≠simo
I love the pre-made list. Who ever does it for then know what there doing!!!!!!!
Amazing app!
Easy browsing, any song you want, personal lists. Everything is good! Enjoy!
Love that gamers can use while playing videogames and with your cell phone
Hello
I love spotify but I hate that some of my songs get skipped or they are not available to play is there anyway to fix that problem someone let me know please
As good as it gets for the music person
Spotify is so much better.
I recommend and prefer Spotify as my number 1 music app than Apple Music and Pandora.
Great way to listen to music.
Good app but the upgrade is more necessary then with Pandora.
Hands down worth 9.99 a month love it!!!
Easy setup as well as easy use
Use the browse and mood selection!
I click on the ads and it never does anything? I have tried deleting and redownloading but it is not changing. Will change rating if answered by devs
Best music app
Best music app I have used so far. Easy to use, fun to share music, all playlists are relevant and recommendations are always welcomed and on point.
Thanks for making this a better world, share more music! #sendnudes
Great app! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
Lo m√°ximo
Fully enjoy Spotify..
I have had this app for over a year, and I have the premium version. And I‚Äôve been wanting there to be lyrics available, but they‚Äôre not.  I find myself listening to lyric music videos on YouTube. It‚Äôs not too hard to add lyrics to a song. There is no point to pay for Spotify when charge 10 dollars a month and don‚Äôt even bother adding lyrics to the music. 
Great!!!!
the best music app ive used! love it
Found my faves!!!!
Spotify is a fantastic way to create playlists that YOU enjoy. It also helps bring new artists to you attention through their discover weekly playlists they compile for you.
I have to purchase the Spotify Premium in order to link my account to my ‚ÄúAmazon Dot‚Äù. I should be able to play it for free with commercial just like I do on my phone.  If I Bluetooth my phone to a different speaker, I do not have to upgrade. Why would Playing it through ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù be any different.  All the other music apps allow this. Except Spotify. Some much Greed in this world. I will now be deleting my account. 
From Smokin DJ Bob
I enjoy Spotify it does what I need. That‚Äôs it
:)
Solid
I have downloaded over 1000 music on spotifyplay list its gone im starting over....BUMMER plenty of the song that i have saved i dont remember because there was so many play for hours. Spotify can you help me recover those songs back?                       Your loyal customer                       Ill be very greatful 
Highly recommended!

Excellent app.
This is one of the best apps ever
Good app
My only complaint is that I have playlists with like 600 songs but it seems to play the same 100 when I shuffle, no matter how many times I shuffle.
Nice cool app
Its good...
So far so good, keep it up, I'm liking it more than pandora
Great quality of music and very few ads  Love it when other apps won't play music after I'm off them  ^^ yea 
It‚Äôs good and has a lot of songs but the skip amount is annoying and I can‚Äôt rewind songs also I don‚Äôt like when it adds random songs to my playlist
muy buena
Great selection. Plays well. Would recommend.
To stop showing up
Lahv
I have been using Spotify never disappointed me!
Love Spotify and especially the album of black panther
Great app!!
I love you Spotify
best ever best ever best ever best ever best ever best ever best
So amazing after getting premium, so for trying 3 month for just .99 now I buy the family pack deal for$14.99 amazing, and for all y'all complaining about the free play lol. Get a job and buy it premium and re write the reviews, I guarantee you y'all change the mind...
I‚Äôve been a Spotify user for about 3 years, and it just keeps getting better. Sharing music is my favorite way to connect with people, so I love this app. Worth it is an understatement.
As much as I love Spotify, it had some tweaks that we're almost deal breakers. But it's getting better. Before integrating local files was a nihtmare, but recently, I was able to get everything over with no problem! Maybe soon they will release the 3333 song download limit then it would be perfect
Muy complacida con la calidad y el repertorio  de m√∫sica. De todos los gustos.
So easy to share music
Awesome
I use Spotify everyday! It‚Äôs my number one music app! Definitely worth getting premium, and if you are a college student you get a student discount making it so much nicer!
Best music. Such good playlists that are already made for you. Definitely recommend it.
This app is a love letter to music. Simply beautiful, excellent work Spotify!
I listen to my music daily and the only problem I have is when the music randomly pauses or freezes randomly without me touching the phone
Love this app!!
I love this app
The app is fantastic with the exception of the thumbs up and down feature which continues to give me issues and won‚Äôt register my selection.  Otherwise it‚Äôs a great service.
üíô‚ù§Ô∏è
It‚Äôs the best. The only online music I listen too.
Makes everything better!!! Love Spotify so much! Motivates me through the toughest workouts!
Have your music wherever you go!
NASTAY
Spotify allows you to listen to any music you wish and to be able make your own playlists and to create playlists for others to share!
Best thing since sliced bread.
Found all my music big homie
I absolutely love this app it has met all my musical needs :)
Thank you for beautiful music.
It wont let me sign up. I pressed the i forgot the password button and i reset my password and it says its the wrong password. And I HATE IT plus the date of birth thing it wont let me put in my ‚Äúage‚Äù and I dont get why you have to be a certain age to get the app. It‚Äôs stupid and annoying.
I just started listening to Spotify and so far I am impressed.
Very good app to use all my favorite music
I love it and have had it for 2 and half years just the price is a little expensive and get to hear it from my mom on how she been spending $30.00 over 3 mph the maybe like $6.00 or $7.00
Best app ever! Gets me out of bed in the morning, gets me through work, through happy times and sad! Helps me workout, meditate and sleep! Can‚Äôt live without my music at the touch of a button!
I LOVE THIS APP it is amazing I can listen to Havana and Michael Myers theme and songs all I want !!!!!!!
Could use a better shuffle
Love it üò¨üíî
Love it
THE  B E S T  EVER!
It's awesome worth it!!!! It's has all the music and some podcasts and a whole lot of other things it's awesome
You can listen to anything you want!!!
Normally my go to music app but now it won‚Äôt let me shuffle my songs.üòï
Best app
Love it amazing
This is by far the best app on the App Store
Excelente
Love the app. One suggestion can they do a recently listened to on the radio portion of the app. Would be great to come back and see what you or a friend just listened to.
Premium is so worth the money!!
Good
L
Love it
Lo recomiendo.
Better than Pandora! Commercial every 1/2 hr is better!
Music suggestions are good
I love Spotify. It‚Äôs the bomb.com.  Suggestion, musicians use this app heavily.  This app would be amazing if it gave the ability to loop sections of a song to aid in learning a song!
I like the app. It‚Äôs easy to use and I can find the music I want.
Love the app, wish the free trial was just free and didn't charge after it ended. Still adore it!
It‚Äôs great
YOU are the best!
Thank you Spotify for the amazingly positive vibes every day!!
I love it. Music you know.
Literally changed the way the world experiences music.
i highly recommend this app to all music lovers out there!  Way better than music app I‚Äôve previously uploaded.. glitches are fixable! 
Dope
Thanks Spotify! If you ever want to get a bunch of your music and still watch the Charts of global ratings ,Then this is the app for you!
Loves it
Lit
Easy to use and download playlists to your phone. Only complaint is that I haven't figured out how to reorder songs in a playlist (but that's probably just me)
Spotify is the best music
Very nice
Music ever
More music needs to be added and better storage to save music. Link up with Tidal and Apple Music. !!!!!
I absolutely love this app! There is much music variety.
Love it
Enjoy on my commute to work and has become the music app to go to as I hear exactly what my taste is.
So easy to use!!! Love that they have related artist suggestions, helps me discover sooooo many other artist I didn‚Äôt know about!
Love this app
Lo mejor de lo mejor
When I download this on my devices only some of them work great. When I downloaded Spotify on my phone it only allows me to hit shuffle play and I have no choice but to wait the song out even tho I don‚Äôt like the song
You can find just about any music you would like and it‚Äôs all free!
Why take the time to create playlists when I can‚Äôt get anything on them to play.  Get a bunch of suggested crap and not what I want.  Thanks but no thanks.
Playlists, albums, stations  You name it. That‚Äôs Spotify.  It would be nice to see the details of the artist, sometimes a bit of history goes a long way 
I have been using Spotify for about 3 years now and I have come to the conclusion that it is really good. But there are a few things I don‚Äôt like witch is the amount of adds and the forced shuffle play. Forced shuffle play is when it doesn‚Äôt let you pick the song you want you have to his Shuffle Play and it‚Äôs kind of annoying. But other than that it‚Äôs a great app and if you listen to music you should get it.
Easy to use
Just need more skips if possible
I love it
SPOTIFY PREMIUM SHOULD BE ONLY $5 or $6 u will get more users
Spotify user experience is unmatched!! Spotify is BAE
Lit
Everything right. Nothing wrong.  Deutsches Bier Uber Alles
Clarity of sound and quality is nice
Fits all moods
So much more variety than Apple Music! Finding new music to listen to is so much more easier.
Happy Valentines Day to everyone!  A wonderful selection of songs from one Harvard Law School graduate to another.  She is as she always was, the Boss.
5 stars, but there is one very very annoying issue though:  If behind the lyrics is off, the thumbnail of the song slides down just enough so you can see there is a ‚ÄúBehind the lyrics‚Äù info behind, than it slides back on. During this down/up period, the song cannot be skipped, you‚Äôll have to wait for the animation to be finished.  Dear sw developers, i have turned off behind the lirycs on purpose do not annoy me with that.  I can still see the Behind the lyrics tab behind the song‚Äôs picture and will check it if i want.  Please remove the animation asap! 
I like it. Its very subtle and very easy to use
Best app ever used
Fav music app on the store. Little cool suggestion would be, when you go to an album or playlist and see the ‚Äúshuffle play‚Äù button, be able to long hold or force push on it and be able to queue to the next song or whenever. Also a more self explanatory equalizer would be awesome! Keep up the great work!
Best streaming app!
Deberia tener lyrics
Spotify knows what music I like
For allowing me to have all this music and listening like ayee
Good appüëå
It‚Äôs awesome
This app is the best. I love it, always have always will. My favorite feature is being able to use it on any device, like my amazon echo, and controlling the music with all other devices still while it plays on the one. Not only have I never been handicapped by not using Apple music with my devices, I have also just never been disappointed a single time. It‚Äôs so much more simple to use and navigate than some other competitors. Honestly, they had me at the ‚Äòswipe to change song‚Äô feature- it makes using this thing like second nature. I‚Äôve had them since before they even released in America, and it‚Äôs been that good the whole time.  Keep up the quality service - and I will never switch.
They must pay their UX designers a lot of money because the interface and interactions are flawless.
I'm willing to pay for Spotify Premium, but when I click OK on the premium pop-ups, it just closes the window. Doesn't make much sense why you wouldn't let me pay, but you do you I guess.
PLEASE bring the hold to preview feature back.
Spotify is better than Pandora, all I can say.
Me gusta tiene toda tipo de m√∫sica
Love it!
Thank you I like and enjoy this and that I can use it for free and and go to something else on my phone and still listen to music God Bless you all!
I really love the music selection, but I do wish that you could download music, or even play without shuffle, without needing to pay for premium
I got to say this is way better than pandora you can actually skip whenever you ant and you can get rid of adds with out payment and all the songs you want to listen to when you want you actually can not like pandora
It kule and gud
If you want to play musicAnd not pay for it
Goob moosic and jams yay!üëå
Excellente musica y recepcuon. La recomiendo no solo en USA sino en Mexico tbienüëçüèº 
Great app. Easy to use.
The best music app for streaming. Needs some aesthetic changes, but overall a good app.
reee
This is one of the best music apps I‚Äôve used. I‚Äôve used the free and the premium and I can definitely say I was happy with both. You can still make playlists on free. The difference is literally just the option to select songs and no commercials. But that was a jump I personally made but if it doesn‚Äôt bather you then you will still be very happy with the free version.
Hasta el momento mucho mejor que Pandora. !! Tenga su like üëçüèª
It's so great! Doesn't use up much data! Only thing is the fact you can't choose what song you'd like to play unless you have premium
I like the set up
The free version is not so great because you can‚Äôt pick a song and play it, you have to shuffle play - but if you get premium then this is 100% the BEST music app you will find.
Just tried it to see if it was better than pandora so far so good soon I might be buying premium
Great
Love it
Easy to navigate. It has all the functions as the web appZ
Where did the downloads tab go?
I wanted Apple Music to be number one. I have had Spotify for years now. Tried the Apple Music and Spotify is easier to make playlist with out messing with my library on my phone. Also most of my streaming is on WiFi so Spotify has a higher bitrate that sounds better on my big speakers at home. They also have 3 bitrates to chews from for the most optimal listening. I tried but I can‚Äôt give up my Spotify.
Excellent product, small improvements they've made have been great
AMAZING I love it and there are all the songs ever made on earth it's amazing I love it.No lag,works perfectly all the time amazing you should get this app
App Perfect in version premium, pay.
Wish Spotify could allow us to choose usernames, but the app runs smoothly and deserves a 5 star rating.
Slappers on deck
It's not amazing
Best app, love pre made mix suggestions
SPOTIFY IS MY LIFEEEE
I love this app
Perfect üòç
Every 5 sec you get an ad
Son momentos de recuerdo que lo transportan al pasado cuando era adolescente gracias por esa satisfacci√≥n.
Is literony and cheeseeeee my duuuudes
Slow to load no matter what WiFi or let connection, frequently dropping connection, looses playlist location of song playing, outdated UI! It also looses or drops connection with Amazon Alexa devices... the worst part is I‚Äôm paying for this crappy UI service!!!!
Great music
It good but it no Knack 2
I LOVE Spotify.....normally I am going for specific artists/songs, so Spotify is perfect....BUT BUT BUT.   I had some guests, they wanted different genres....when we played (i.e. 70's/80s/Motown, we heard NOT the original artists being played, but remakes....don't mess with your loyal fans.
It is really good music wise and a great variety of music. But many adds. But you can get premium and have no adds
I used to use the app all the time but now it im back to using soundcloud. I will be calmly listening to a song i added to my playlist and then after that song is up 6 other songs that werent apart of my playlist would play. I get it im not a premium member and so this review will probably be ignored bc you don‚Äôt profit from my use of the app but if i have a playlist cant it just stick to the playlist or occasionally play a suggested song? I get the ads thats fine but i go to play my playlist and it‚Äôs mostly made up of suggestions and not my music.
Great music amazing sound and very easy to use.......
Love this song!! Throwing truth‚ù§Ô∏è
Great App - but can only use it while I‚Äôm abroad. Great pity it doesn‚Äôt work in South Africa. Please fix this....?
Great app!
Muy bueno para mi estilo de vida
I absolutely love Spotify!
I love this app but I could use some less ads like I use this in school and if I want 30 minutes I have to get out my phone and press it without getting caught but I love it
I love this app
Ok
I love the artistes and music
Ha y‚Äôall probably thought I was about to write something positive tf I look like Dj Khalid but it do got the best music I ain‚Äôt gonna lie
I am new to it I like the history snippets from the artists especially.
I‚Äôve been using Apple Music since it came out. I love how well it‚Äôs integrated with my Apple devices, but it‚Äôs never been good about discovering new music for me. That‚Äôs the truth. I‚Äôve been using Spotify barley an hour, and I can already tell it‚Äôs better at discovering my pallet of songs.   I think I might keep both, only because I just don‚Äôt want to leave Apple Music. It‚Äôs like being committed to a marriage; it‚Äôs not perfect, but I can over look those imperfections.   Spotify is like my extramarital affair. It‚Äôs hot, something fresh, reminds me why I love music, and leaves me yearning that my marriage will somehow get better in the future.   Until then, Spotify will have a place in my heart and on my home screen. 
Just, amazing
I like it
I love Spotify & all the radio selections
It‚Äôs good ig
Good
It works!
Apple Music is awesome, but Spotify is on point!
I use it every day
Hate how you have to buy to skip songs
100% buena musica.
I love it
I freaking love this app so much the premium is sooo worth it. If music is a big part of your life i recommend premium. I have it and its great. If it isnt premium you dont get the FULL experience but its still good because their isnt much ads. With premium you could do a bunch of good stuff like listen any song any time, dont need wifi or data to listen to music, no ads (thank god). Really recommend üòäüòä
Just love. Love.
My daily mixes are always spot on and there are so many other stations to choose from. Far and away the best music app.
I love Spotify so much! It has all of my favorite songs and for free! üòä
i love spotify but they really need to bring the preview feature back!
Best app for online and offline music, totally worth it
Free
Love this app.  Get to listen to the latest and greatest!!
Couldn‚Äôt be happier with Spotify
I have the app on my iPad, and it's great. But I got the app for my iPod and every time I click into the app, it crashes. I don't get a chance to look at the browse page. All I see is the app logo and then it crashes, and I'm left with seeing my home screen. I'm not sure if this is some sort of bug or if the app just isn't compatible with Apple iPods, but I want this fixed.
Good stuff
I used to love this app, i would listen to my playlists everyday. I then decided to end my subscription because it just wasn‚Äôt right for me. The next day i go to listen to my music and i find that my account became ‚Äúinactive‚Äù and i can no longer access my account or listen to my music. I‚Äôm very upset, angry and disappointed.
Love this app unlimited music with no commercials or ads love love it.
You get to choose the songs you listen to. But if you want to discover something new, they can make a radio station based off of a playlist, too. It does exactly what you want, and it has everything. What else do you want?
Awesome App, recommend it to all my friends and family.
Up until a couple weeks ago this used to be a great app I loved listening to the 70s radio, but they don't understand that people like listening to the classic version of a song not some "remastered" crap. Also the ads are terrible, cringy, and very inappropriate for kids and teens, I can't even buy premium so I can stop listening to this trash, plus every time I make a playlist I'll have something like my favorites playlist and I'll get these recommended crap that has nothing to do with what I'm listening to. So if you want to have all the stuff I mentioned above then go ahead, this is an app where those who pay get better treatment (net neutrality) and those who don't are stuck with the worst stuff ever.                                           .                                                           Spotify if you want me and others to stay improve or get rid of this stuff because for a platform this large I would expect some better content and this isn't "a mistake" its lazy your accountable for your app so step up and make it better.
This app is super cool
I just type an artist or song in, and I listen to hours of my favorite music
It's lit tho
How come I can not change my user name to what I want
I used to be a Pandora person,but Spotify is the best!! You pick the songs and listen to what you want!
Me encanta la recomiendo
I like the service ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Bomb!
Best app ever
App is lit üî•üî•üî•
I love Spotify so much, I can listen to all my favorite for free!!! And if you get premium you can download and listen off WiFi, I have the family plan, so it is 2 birds with one stone. my Dad, sister, and brother can listen, all premium. Thank you Spotify for making music easy !!!             - A loyal listener <3 
Love it.
The app is ok...I wish I could just pick the song I wanted instead of listening to an entire playlist before getting to the song I wanted but other than that it‚Äôs good
üòÅüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
Spotify is a great app in allows you to really listen to music and great quality and even let you have 30 minutes worth of Listening to music without any Ads It‚Äôs a great app you really get to control what you listen to it to see if it‚Äôs explicit and no it‚Äôs over millions of songs on this app it‚Äôs an amazing App I love this app so much and here‚Äôs the best part that is free
Haven‚Äôt had any problems unless it had to do with cell service
Absolutely amazing app I recommend it!!!!
I love this app
amazing
I made a playlist it was fine for the first 2 songs but then a song I never heard of came on sooo was wit dat? DAWG?
Great just doesn‚Äôt have all songs I like üòï
adds
Improve the app audio
Really is the best of the streaming app
Spotify nails streaming music and has plenty to offer
App is amazing. I wish the daily mix songs would change...their not mixed daily if they don‚Äôt change. Other than than that...great app
I love you Spotify, but I see what you did on the latest update. You think you know me better than me?? F*ck you Spotify. You don't know me. Okay maybe you do. Even better than I do. But stop that sh^t! I'm human dammit. Love your app -- stop tying to be a robot. Spotify does NOT equal google.
This is not the Spotify I remembered. I get ads saying if I want 30 minutes of ad free music and when I watch the ad it doesn‚Äôt even take away the ads. It just gives you like 5 minutes and then you get an ad saying that the next 30 minutes are ad free music. There is also random songs playing that are not even in my playlist.
I love this app... up until its most recent updated followed with glitches such as removing my playlists completely, playing playlists I've never heard of and switching songs on its own... please fix it as quick as you can!
You want to hear a song? It is at your fingertips.
I use this app everyday for my ongoing music needs. The variety of artists and their music is stupendous. Would definitely recommend this app to my family and friends.
Quiero descargar Spotify premium como lo hago mi tel√©fono no me lo permite porque ?
I‚Äôve never had any major problems apart from taking forever to load ‚Äúartists‚Äù or ‚Äúplaylists‚Äù even though I have them all downloaded, as well as sometimes having to re-download my whole music library... but for the past week the app has just been glitching horribly (e.g. freezing and not being able to skip songs, showing a different song than what is playing and just continuously crashing). I have an iPhone 7 with the latest iOS update and loads of storage left so there really shouldn‚Äôt be a reason why it‚Äôs playing up. Such a shame because it‚Äôs a great app that I keep all of my music and playlists on, but the software is just not up to scratch considering how much I pay each month...
Luv the variety & can always find new songs favorite artists
Tienen buena variedad de m√∫sica y no pasan tantos comerciales.
Cause i do
SPOTIFY PREMIUM ALL THE WAYYY  BY FAR BEST APP EVER 
You can find any song.  Even ones you havent heard in years!
Love it. Simple
This app is really good for listening to music especially if you have a student account with premium. Just spend like 2 dollars a mouth it won‚Äôt kill you to use it on an amazing app
Has every music
Good
Okay, so I think Spotify is a good app for music but like, why is it always pushing ‚Äúyou found a hidden premium feature ‚Äú or ‚Äúget premium now!‚Äù In my face. I also want to listen to my music and not songs about random hole in the wall topics. So if Spotify if you‚Äôre reading this, just change it.
Great categories! Loving the mantra selection.
i like the app alot i just wish they didnt have as much ads
Love it
üò¨
Love this service & app! I have music all day, everywhere! Endless choices. Highly recommend.
I love this app.
Nice
I like new music and Spotify makes finding new music of all genres very easy and enjoyable.
So easy to use
Pretty good though plus it‚Äôs cheap
Pleaseeeee
Excelente todo la uso siempre en todo momento y tiene bastante m√∫sica
Great app
Amazing i love this app is so goodüòçüíô
Great app
Best app for music!!!
Significant improvement over Pandora. I wished I had changed much earlier.
it could be better if you could ACTUALLY listen to music on demand, like it says, instead of shuffle play
Premium shouldn't have a limit for downloads otherwise pretty great
I‚Äôm just new to Spotify... but loving it so far!
Better than all the others
Accommodates all my musical needs!
usually the shuffle option is fine it will play songs randomly (from saved songs) now it‚Äôs only the same 5 artists over and over again that i barely listen to! hate it please fix
A1
A love it
It's really clean and easy, and I really like how you can add whole albums at a time. I wish it didn't have as many ads but I guess they're necessary. Could be better, I wish that offline listening wasn't paid; I'm broke and just want to listen to my music wherever.
I love this app so much it‚Äôs where I get all my music
Better then pandora
So far so good gots all my music
Thank you
My go to music on my phone
‚ù§Ô∏èthe Choices @ Spotify My go to App
Great interface to all of my devices; amp, amazon echo, Volumio etc.  Sound quality is excellent!
Love the variety!
it‚Äôs never slow, it never lags, and it has every song that you could ever think of.
This app is great. You can listen to music for free which is the whole point. However, I NEVER get to hear all the songs on my playlist. I don‚Äôt have premium, but I rather hear adds between songs than not even hear my playlist at all. I would keep the recommendations though, but just don‚Äôt include other songs into my playlist because I find it annoying and I‚Äôm sure others do too.
Love it
I never write reviews but this issue has been irritating me far too long now. The shuffle option in your "Songs" playlist (not sure if it's the same on other playlists) only plays the most recent music you've added. It fails to recognize the vast ensemble of song choices that I've added over the years that I have been using Spotify. If this issue continues I am going to strictly use Apple music.
Great
Great app with limitless choices! Looking forward to discovering new music.
So far I‚Äôm loving it
Love Spotify they‚Äôve definitely come along way since there first launch, think I may invest in there stocks, great job!! I‚Äôm listening to Michelle Obama‚Äôs playlist ‚ÄúForever Mine‚Äù right now....woo woo 
I love that you actually have a offline mode to where you‚Äôre able to play songs for free and offline
Love this app when I saw SoundCloud it thought it was ok but I knew that Spotify might be better and I compared both apps and found that Spotify is better so I would recommend it!!!!!!
I like Spotify because I use it everyday of my life! Any song you can think of they probably have. So I recommend downloading this
I Love Spotify Soo Way Beyond Extremely Really Very Much, It‚Äôs The Coolest App Ever!
This app is so good but they should take the ads out
Buena aplicaci√≥n
Loving creating my own playlists and following others‚Äô fun ones.
Hi, i just downloaded  the app but I can't register. I type my email and says it doesn't recognize it
App frequently crashes and is very slow to load. When playing a playlist it plays a few songs and then begins to play random suggested songs
Gg
I hit Spotify up when I get sick of the radio, which is usually all the time!! I love that my playlists are always there, as well as the current billboard mixes!!
Love it thank

Seamless integration with google home mini and Alexa. Works perfectly in India and United States. Would highly recommend getting premium version.
I hate being asked to review stuff.

Within past month or so, update has changed to where connecting over Bluetooth will randomly change the playing style to 1-song repeat. This style is pretty useless to begin with but even more annoying since it will default to this style. Also would be good if lock screen menu and Waze mini player showed shuffle & repeat buttons
Got me into music
Great app
Great genre playlists.
Y   ALV squad üôÉ
The only thing about Spotify I don't like is it is a bit hard to figure out where everything is. After using the app for a little while you get used to it. But this is an amazing app that I would totally recommend to anyone in search for a good music app.
Good Music
Great song !!!
I love free streaming, and Spotify understands what I like and dislike. Keep the great music rolling.
Friendly use
I love the songs of spotify
So good
I can listen all types of music
First let me play my own songs on my phone. Second of all I don‚Äôt have money to pay for premium and I don‚Äôt want to waste data.
Love the ability to listen to more then the mainstream music streams. Great artists you would never get to hear and enjoy on other music platforms. Plus, I Shazam and link to my Spotify account. Can‚Äôt get better than that.
ü§òüòéü§ò
I just joined & it‚Äôs really easy to navigate . Great app üëçüèΩ
Love the app
üíÉüèΩ great!
Worth it. Every month.
Love it!
This app is awesome get it love it
When I signed up for my free premium trial it was still acting as tho I had a free account and it took a while for the support team to fix it they had two accounts with my name tho I only signed up once and just always used the free app it took four days and me having to create a twitter account to reach them for them to get on the same page as me and fix it but they credited my account for a second free month so that was cool  That‚Äôs my only complaint happy it got fixed 
Probably the best app in my phone
Love the app. Especially the Discover Weekly playlists. Always a perfect combination of my favorite kinds of music.
I love Spotify.
Love the variety options
You won‚Äôt be disappointed
Removing basic necessities of a music app and adding it to premium. But has every band you can think of and can listen to music out of app. Sooo eh.
Loving it
Works great
It‚Äôs perfect for me and my children
Love this app all the choicesüé∂üòä
Simply love the playlists on Spotify. It allows you to discover so many awesome artists you might have never heard of. Something about their algorithm, it just works so good! You're really missing out on music without Spotify.
Works great on my iPhone 5s and iPhone 6. Also connected to my Alexa at home.  I don‚Äôt like that I have to change the listen to ‚Äúon this device‚Äù and I start it sometimes, because it initially starts to play on my Alexa. 
Always!
My favorite music app by far
It has all the songs you Want and Need üñ§üñ§üëå
I have cellular data turned off to Spotify but it still uses data.
Awesome!
Not only because my employer offers a free Spotify premium membership did I switch from pandora- Love the platform and style of the app, seems to work more often than not, and is easy.
Yay!
Best music app hands down. Great music choice especially when it comes to the suggested playlists
Use at work and home always fab selection of songs.
I love the way you can download the real songs instead of SoundCloud where I gives you fake songs.
Best for my Pearl Jam mix of songs!
I love Spotify !!
(Almost) Everything I always wanted... some obscure titles they don‚Äôt have but the vastness is something I would never see in my lifetime.
Great way to enjoy MY music. Thank you!
App works great with great music!
Love this app bcuz it's great and I ain't no fakee
The best app ever
I can‚Äôt find the same variety anywhere else. Please offer a service for $4.99 üôè
So goooooodddüòú
ffffffffffooo
Love this app! It recommends all the right music for me
Buen citio para tener tu m√∫sica üëå
Excellent service,attention!
Very much enjoying Spotify, even with people telling me to get Apple Music. My mind is made up!
The best of music app
Love the variety of playlists to choose from.
Overall it seems I get ads every 10 minutes other than 30 but it‚Äôs still good.
The latest version of this app keeps crashing, doesn‚Äôt connect to internet and doesn‚Äôt show me the bar at the bottom or on my locked screen for downloaded songs! I‚Äôve been using Spotify for years now and it‚Äôs never done that before. I also tried checking for help and the support website is not helpful at all!
I love the music
Dope
Easy to use and very intuitive.
Sooooo much better than Pandora!!!!
It‚Äôs goot
Love to work out with it
Best app ever
I will not travel anywhere without my Spotify; during trial prep, during trial and traveling, Spotify always keeps me at ease!!!
Love Spotify!
I mad I never knew about this sooner
I use it everyday. Everyday!
Great at home but kind of a pain on mobile devices.  Even with premium it is a chore to try offline play
Love it.
I love the app I use it daily on my phone and PS4 when I‚Äôm gaming, but I also use the Pacemaker app and I have T-Mobile which there is a networking issue going on so that using cellular data when using pacemaker you can not connect to Spotify to create mixes, t mobile is dragging their feet on the issue which is crazy because it effects EVERY T MOBILE USER and I‚Äôve seen a lot of complaints already
I do like this app, but it seems to miss on a lot of basic functions.  Pros: - Great layout - Very large library of music - Ability to make playlists  Cons: - Shuffle does not do well in this app. A lot of the same artists/songs come up on my workout playlist that has 600+ songs. - You can‚Äôt remove songs from playlists in the app 
I use Spotify in school and it‚Äôs a very reliable app, thanks Spotify you deserve the stars!
Good song keep it up üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº
Love This App! Amazing Selections & Wonderful Services! Just Awesome! Spotify Gets It Done!!
When I first used Spotify a few years ago it didn‚Äôt have any of the songs I wanted and just kinda sucked, now it‚Äôs wonderful and I think everyone should have it.
Spotify has changed the way I listen music. Premium is worth every penny. I would give up Netflix before I cancelled Spotify.
Left Apple Music and it was worth it
App is great, fair price and helps me find new music. All positives. The negative? This app completely destroys my battery. I can go to the gym and listen for like an hour and my phone will die. Please optimize the app for ideal battery life.
The best app for music.
Excellent
Relative to price
Love to create playlists and share
Best Music App I've ever used!
Its best music app I've been using for more then a year. Big music library, tremendous quality! Fix the music search please from the my music folders, every time I want to search one of my own songs I have to scroll all the way up to the end to do so. Fix that ASAP its gonna be a great help for all! I haver over 1,000 songs and counting. Would be great with alphabetic order!
Great app. I can control what I‚Äôm listening to better then with most other Music apps.
Love it on my phone or on my computer. User friendly. Awesome
Best music app ever
Bigjhfuhcg
It‚Äôs good
I love using Spotify! I can find whatever music I‚Äôm looking for and createmy own playlist so I can share it with my family
Amazing app you should get it because it has great music quality, often deals on premium and has all the songs you could imagine.
Best app ever
The best. Simple as that
The only thing missing is showing most played music by artist when clickimg the artist and it's missing an EQ 4 stars from me
Amazing
Spotify allowed me to select a song selection group suggested by my pastor.  It‚Äôs great- already selected for me songs I like and that we sing at church.
I wish played the whole album when I shuffle play, rather than playing just one then playing a suggested track.
Best app ever.
No complaints üëåüèæ
Amazing app
It's great. If I could change one thing it's that I'd like less screen prominence devoted to the channels of music that's commissioned by Spotify and to poor quality covers of songs they don't have in the library. I think it's fine that stuff is there, but it should be easier to ignore it. Otherwise fantastic.
Simple to navigate. Swiping gestures makes the app enjoyable. This is everything Apple Music should be. It just works.
My go to app!
Great
The best music I‚Äôll recommend offline mode
Spotify is the only place I listen to music. We have the premium family plan and it‚Äôs perfect for our family.
Best app on the planet besides the JW Library app
Until they removed the ‚Äúmy downloads‚Äù tab. Now finding my downloaded albums and playlists is a pain. I‚Äôm not even sure if I have albums downloaded that I forgot about because I can‚Äôt find them.
So far great. Easy to make a library. Rock on!
The Spotify on my PS4 Doesn‚Äôt play suggested songs and on the app it does also on PS4 you can skip whenever on the app you can‚Äôt I‚Äôll put 5 stars when y‚Äôall fix this
Very relaxing with my faves!
Great app we always use and listen to it for holidays and family gatherings.
Can‚Äôt do much, but what you can do is dope
Watching ads is easy for the 30 minute no commercials

Amaizing
Spotify is an amazing app. My battery is great, and I love the recommended songs. I listen to Green Day, Fob, T√∏p, MCR, and a bunch of other bands on here. The quality is great and I like Spotify way more than Apple Music. Spotify premium is so simple and easy to use.
Great app
It‚Äôs good
Coo
I am not sure but they could simply have an autoplay list option disable like YouTube. In options there could be simple like play again play repeat or play once or stop after play when playing list so that if I want to play a song specific way I can have option.
This app works around the world where other apps only work in the us
Better than pandora üëçüèº
I LOVE SPOTIFY the only reason why I‚Äôm not giving it 5 stars is because I really wish they made it compatible with the Apple Watch. It would be so much more convenient for working out and for outdoor runs when I want to leave my phone at home and use my wireless headphones.
This is a fantastically made app, it‚Äôs really everything someone could ask for from a music app and more. But, it would be nice if these changes were made:  1) a history of music you‚Äôve saved before or interacted with at all. There are some songs I‚Äôve deleted completely by accident that I hadn‚Äôt memorized the names of and it would be nice if there was an easier way of finding them after losing them.   2) i sometimes forget that I didn‚Äôt check on discover weekly one week. It would be very cool if there was a way to see a history on discover weekly, like a pull down tab that has what was recommended, organized by the date (ex. January 1st, 2018-January 7th, 2018)  3)Programmable playlists would be awesome. I have made 3 different playlists of my favorite songs at the time, and I have so many because I‚Äôd outgrown the songs on my playlist. If I could for example make on my own a ‚Äútop 50 favorite songs‚Äù that played the most played songs from the last month and updated on its own that would be perfect. These programmable playlists could also have songs to base recommendations on, so for example, if I liked 3 songs a lot, I could make a playlist that are comprised of songs similar to those 3. It would be nice to also be able to categorize these by genre or tempos if we wanted to or not. The more customization, the better. You could add these for customization (these parameters):  Location (from the world all the way to the city or even within 10 miles of wherever you are. If I want the location recommendations to be based on a stagnant location or wherever I am at the time) Tempo ranges Explicit words/mature themes  Genres Songs only from my library/any songs Similar to (blank) songs Set strictness on any of these parameters Friends Most played within (blank) amount of time Pull songs only from specified playlists Whatever recommendation algorithm you use now for discover weekly 
This app is very simple to use and leads you toward other similar music you might prefer.
I would give it five but I don‚Äôt like paying for it
It‚Äôs good
Great app for listening to music and going to the gym
Just a day goes by and now I can't cast to my Google home/mini unless I pay? Why!!!! What is the difference between this an a home speaker or the speaker on my phone. But waitbincam cast on my Chromecast. That is ok!!!!  It makes no sense Spotify!!!!!!üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò≠
Great place to download music for free just the ads are annoying but if you get premium it‚Äôs amazing! Way better than buying music
Way better than Pandora!  I switched!
I like it
I‚Äôve been using this app for years, I‚Äôve had premium for three years now. This recent update has cause my app to glitch out. Every two or three songs, it will pause randomly but the play button is still on. It just stops loading!! There also problems with it skipping songs without me touching skip, even half way through a song.
When I get bored with my music I go to Spotify so I can listen to a variety of songs. And they give you 30 mins of ad free.
Perrrfect!!
I revisited so many songs that were deleted, but are on spotify ! So clean, so much design, it pops out to me a lot!
I LOVE SPOTIFY especially with premium, no ads and my music still plays even when I have no service plus premium isn‚Äôt even expensive. 5 stars definitely I love it
Definitely one of the best out there
The mixes are great and other features are great also!
Np
For some reason I cannot skip songs as much as I would like on my phone, and I have to use shuffle to listen at all on my phone. It works great on other devices but really Spotify up your game on the phones.
Whole of lotta loving to U guys ü•Çüçæüòéüëçüèæ
The best app for music
Best way to listen to music. Hands down.
Fun free music
Has it's problems but great to use when your phone is almost filled up with MP3 files. Not every artist has it but some do. Really should fix that offline devices error. I missed a whole two weeks of my subscription before I got it fixed. But other than that. I think it's worth the money if you can spare it
Best Internet radio app!
Honestly the quality of the music is unmatched by any other app but if you don‚Äôt upgrade to premium your screwed because of constant and excessive ads and other music that isn‚Äôt what you are wanting to listening to
So much to choose from. Enjoy the daily mix and decades playlists the most.
Buenisimo
Better than pandora because it stays on the same artist and it has their albums I love this app 100% recommend it
I love Spotify but it might be the most glitchy app I use. I have to constantly shut it down just so the music will even play through my speakers. And why does it skip at the beginning of the first song I play every time I connect to it? The app just really needs some work. Otherwise I love my premium account and the selection of music, podcasts and playlists.
IT'S ALL I LISTEN TO. I will never go back! It has Apple Music beat by a long shot! Love the feature that has suggestions of songs for you playlist!! ITS THEEE BEST
I love Spotify so much. It really helps instead of buying separate albums. I also like us people can make our own playlists.
Love this app
Really goes nice with google home
Why do some playlists/albums play only from the songs listed (for example, the Grease album) and others toss in totally random songs (for example, The Last Jedi). In the example above, The Last Jedi listed all the songs by title and composer...but played songs from Thor: Ragnarok, David Archuleta, and Guardians of the Galaxy. All I wanted was Jedi stuff and I got these randos mixed in. I kept checking the play list to see where these songs were, expecting to see them in green. And instead they were nowhere...just playing along the bottom? I don't understand and it makes me frustrated and disappointed.   Other than that it's a useful enough app. Maybe I would normally give it 4 stars but I'm really annoyed at the moment. 
I personally love how you can get all your favorite music and put it into one specific category, I also live the browse feature where you can find the perfect music for the perfect time.(Gaming, Running, Rock Climbing, etc.)
It puts songs I don‚Äôt know and it wasted my time knostly I just YouTube music now
Ads gotta come down a little .. otherwise love music üé∂
I love Spotify
I just wish it had a ‚Äúgenera‚Äù section for your songs
Thanks to spotify i can listen to kpop peacefully üôÉüôÉ
Love it!
Great
I bought a brand new pair of Jaybird Run Wireless earbuds. I went back to retailer to switch them since I heard some static and thought they were defective. At the time of exchange I bought another pair for my fianc√© only to come home and have both new sets sound staticky just like the first pair. I listened to music on YouTube and music sounded beautiful. There must be some interference when using Bluetooth devices with this app. Makes me hate these earbuds I spent a good chunk on.
This app has a mobile problem I can't play the songs I want on my phone 
I love Spotify. I can listen to free music whenever I want.
It is very helpful app when you run while taking a nice hot bath!üòÇ
LIT!!!!ü§òüèª
I like it a lot...!...
Had a fundraiser and used Spotify as background music.  Best thing I ever did!
Love it
This app is so frustrating
Totally worth it to get premium, especially as a student.
Fantastic Appüòä‚úåÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Awesome app
I slept on this app way too long. Peace out pandora.....
Better than iTunes!
I find it very frustrating to not be able to play the song I want to listen to without paying for premium. Sometimes I add just one song to a playlist so I can listen to it but that doesn‚Äôt work either because it will just play songs that I haven‚Äôt even added to the playlist.
The best music app EVER!!!!!
I am in love with Spotify,but I just would like for the ads to be stopped FOR FREE and not have to pay to stop them.
Best app ever
Best
Good app just -1 because you cant use it anywhere
IF I GET ONE MORE COLONOSCOPY AD IM GONNA FLIP A TABLE BRUV
Very good product, I love discover weekly and the fact that you can save your songs. I use it daily
Better than all the other competitors for many reasons. Look it up.
I‚Äôm glad that they are playing music frm the ppl I wanna hear
It‚Äôs close (over ITunes) Spotify premium is the best service for my needs.
Too many adds Kms
Spotify is awesome except you need premium to get all of the cool features
Absolutely amazing
I left Spotify for Apple Music about a year ago. I thought AM had better quality. But I came back to try it again. The new and improved looks, functionality, etc? And then this new and enhanced quality?  I think I‚Äôm going to switch back to Spotify... #ByeByeAppleMusic 
Does all I need. Can‚Äôt complain.
This is the OG
I prefer this over many other music apps I use. I love that it actually had the artists I listen to
Its really cool beucuse its lets you listen to whatever song you want
great job i use it to listen music all the time. 4 stars bcuz i want liner notes/ pictures from the albums =)cheers!  dano 
Spotify is a great free way to listen to specific music. It doesn‚Äôt use radios (I think so) and you can loop songs. The only problem I have with it is that it doesn‚Äôt have some music but that‚Äôs understandable.
üëåüëåüèª
Best app for music
Fantastic music app!!
You can download and play! Nice
Playlists are great
I like how there‚Äôs like three songs, and then a 30 second add. Usually on radio stations, it‚Äôs like 2 songs and 2 minutes of adds. But sometimes, when I watch the video that lets me get 30 minutes without adds, it doesn‚Äôt work. And one more thing. For some reason, the Guns N‚Äô Roses song ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs So Easy‚Äù is missing from Appetite For Destruction.
I am too cheap to get premium otherwise it would be 5 stars if all the music was add free.
.q
Great app!
The streaming quality is extremely poor as Spotify Connect functions have been discontinued.
Thanks!
Excellent music service
Very impressed so far and I've tried all the other music apps and have paid for them. This seems to be the best as of now.
Love it
Freedom and unlimited options for playlists- I Love It!!
Know exactly what types of music i like i love spotify!
I use it every day at work.
Reconnected with music I haven‚Äôt heard in years.
Incre√≠ble aplicaci√≥n para escuchar toda la m√∫sica que quieras, por un precio justo, y pegado con la moneda local, 10 puntos!
Great groups and music
It‚Äôs f lit
This is so awesome. You can just listen to amazing stations. I would recommend getting the premium due to amazing advances in music selection and add skipping. Overall amazing app. Five stars definitely.
I think it is really good i list√≠n to it when i with my homies
It‚Äôs awesome!!!BUT I wish we had unlimited skips for rating for a month‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks
The best
Greatest app ever for you guys enjoy
They help a lot , thanks for this awesome app. Search Spotify for lil Hec. I can‚Äôt believe it
My daughter turned me on to Spotify and so happy she did. I love music but a little stubborn with change. Anyway as the title to this review says Spotify satisfies and I mean that. Just learning to use it but already addicted. Thank you
I can enjoy different types of music. Thanks
Thanks
Bet
Best music app every
I paid for premium for two years and I think it's well worth it, that said I really do wish they bring the lyrics back something I truly enjoyed and wish they would have it again, Amazon music does this part very well. Additionally it would be great if I was able to see the playlist that were created by Spotify or others in a separate tab and ones I created in another. So many amazing playlist it would be better if we can organize them easier. Finally and this is a big one for me I have children that are 4 and 6 and love music and while Kidz Bop is great, sometimes they want to hear the song from the radio, unfortunately many of the songs are inappropriate and are not clean. It would be great Spotify had radio edits or clean versions of songs as a default, as opposed to just explicit lyrics and original versions.  This one just happened recently, you used to be able to press down on a track to hear a sample of it before actually selecting it to play. What a great feature to find the song that you're actually looking for without selecting it. Too bad it's gone now 
Love this app!!
I got this weeks ago and it kept glitching me out and it never played the songs I selected
Amazing, I use Spotify everyday. I have premium and I think it is definitely not a waste of money.
Awesome has every song I want including the Beatles!
Keeps the tempo going while introducing new songs/artists.
Love the app
Love music, but I am enjoying it more now.
>:(
So I accidentally clicked dislikes on a song that I found interesting so I tried to save it but I clicked dislike and so I tried so hard to find that song but sad too see that Spotify doesn‚Äôt have a dislike history
Nice site/ great music

Great app Highly recommend 
It gud, carry on
Best app out there
This my favorite music app
Ok, so I‚Äôm late to Spotify. Better late than never. Loving it so far. Great mix of music.
Awesome
Add the ability to opt out of Nielsen data collection like you advertise
Love it
The only thing keeping me from a perfect score is the lack of a few tracks that I'd consider classic essentials. Otherwise, great interface and expansive catalog.
First week was good until my playlist played other songs not related and said add free IT WAS NOT
Only just started using Spotify and it worked really smoothly. Found all the musical artists I searched for easily, and got into listening without any hasstle. Pleasantly surprised.
When I make a playlist I want a playlist that will only play the music I put in it, not other songs that I am not interested in. Whenever there are too many random songs I can skip them all. ALL BECAUSE I DON‚ÄôT HAVE PREMIUM! It‚Äôs not fair to people who don‚Äôt pay money for premium. I‚Äôve had this problem ever since I got the app and I regret getting the app because of this problem. I have tried contacting Spotify themselves and it had worked for two days tops. Now I can‚Äôt listen to the music I like all because of this app, and how it doesn‚Äôt play what is on your playlist. This needs to be fixed for my sake and others because I assure you, there are other people out there thinking the same thing as me, and they are just as unhappy with the app as I am.
Yeet
LAMUR
Lo mejor de lo mejor!!
Love the app and the ability to listen to what I want!!!
Facts
This is a great app when you‚Äôre using premium. $5 a month with student discounts makes this the only source I need for listening to music. The problem is when you use the free version, this app is basically useless. Imagine your studying and listening to some very chill music to focus then all of a sudden a song (not even in your list) comes on blasting your ears and killing your concentration. If you‚Äôre not using premium then it‚Äôs hard to recommend Spotify.
üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
Get premium it‚Äôs worth it
My own life soundtrack is on Spotify! The playlists that are suggested bring me some new songs to amplify the already great songs I have on my own playlists! I would strongly recommend Spotify to every music lover!
Who wouldn‚Äôt love Spotify
I love that it lets you go available off line so you can still enjoy your playlists if you didn‚Äôt have WiFi! It‚Äôs always been my first choice!
Great way to find new music!
Best application For music (all over the world)
Superb
I love it
After years of Apple Music I‚Äôve finally found a better provider. Man, is Spotify better
Love it
Lastima k haya k pagar...
Gives you great control of your music
I don‚Äôt have premium but it‚Äôs fine because I still listen to the type of music I like.
Great app for music lovers
It work well
Tiene todo tipo de musica
Since I bought premium Spotify has been the most reliable music service I‚Äôve ever owned. I wish standard gave you a little more control over what you‚Äôre going to hear, but overall very happy.
I love the app and it‚Äôs amazing but I can‚Äôt play it using just my Apple Watch!?!? I want to be able to tell Siri to play my music on Spotify and which song too! I only pay $120/year to have Spotify so I think I should be able to use my watch with it, otherwise I‚Äôll move to Apple Music for the same price....
I love Spotify, I can listen to my favorite songs, create my own playlists, and always listen to my music.
Lovee
Very good audio app
So far I love it.  Still learning to navigate but it‚Äôs going well.  Love the music to station comparison.  Based off my selection, you show me a station I may like with other artists. Not to mention, I can then save or download a song or the entire station. I like! 
I enjoy the many different music genres that this app offers.
My sister makes great playlists, so I listen to those, sometimes it freezes, so that would be nice if that was fixed for the free users.
Any song all song on pay a certain amount for no ads still good
i‚Äôve been using tidal for the past 2 years and just switched to spotify. tidal‚Äôs aesthetic is hard to beat, but spotify has lots of good features. to be a student with spotify/hulu is amazing. great experience all around!
The free more sounds better than Pandora's free more
So I just left Pandora to try Spotify. I like it except that Christmas music pops up randomly from artists that I‚Äôve checked off that sing Christmas songs. For example - Frank Sinatra and Michael Buble.  I don‚Äôt care to listen to Christmas songs in January - October. This seems to be a problem that Spotify won‚Äôt address.
I love this app
You take away song-sharing messages, there isn‚Äôt a notification when a playlist you‚Äôre following is updated (or a grouped, single notification if multiple songs), and you can‚Äôt see who is following your playlist(s). And the update text used to be fun and informative. You‚Äôve gone the FB route, spotify. Not to mention the poor pay return for smaller artists, but anyway. Maybe it‚Äôs time to switch back to buying and storing my own music.
üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº a very great app
Very nice! I have the free version and it is lit! The premium must be awesome!
She is, quite simply, she is brilliant!
i love spotify !!!
So I absolutely Love this App it is in my opinion the best easy to use music download app out there, but lately when I'm listening 10-20 seconds into a song the app backs out completely and I have to relaunch it, it's been doing this for a week now with no reason :( I miss listening to my Spotify playlist please help!!!!
Y‚Äôall the greatest!
This app is really cool, different from other music apps I‚Äôve previously used where u have to listen to songs u don‚Äôt like to get to the ones you do like. Even without subscribing you can custom make your own playlist, stations, and even listen to a complete artists album! watch like a 20sec (sometimes less) ad and get 30mins of interruption-free FREE music. I‚Äôve been using this app for a few years now and absolutely love it. They‚Äôre above and beyond the other music apps. I always recommend this app to my friends... well the ones I like....lol jk. But seriously, GET SPOTIFY!üëàüèº You won‚Äôt be disappointed!üëçüèºüôÇ
I go to concert lounges and clubs a great deal to see LIVE music and very often the artist performing has their catalog on Spotify.
Q cuquis
Awesome
Best radio app ever
Great selection. The welcome mix is great!
ESKETIT
The music  selection is endless. My mom purchased Spotify for all of her children. She told us once you listen to Spotify you will never listen to Pandora again. And guess what she was right. Spotify is like having my own personal music library. I couldn‚Äôt be more satisfied.
It‚Äôs like pandora on steroids.
I love Spotify. It‚Äôs so much better if you have premium
Awesome staton
It is amazing I love the app
I use Spotify in my everyday life. ( literally EVERY DAY!) it is amazing because you discover new music all the time. If you are one of those people who know what songs they like and then listen to them on repeat, this may not be the app for you. If you like to find what your taste is then this is your app! Ads are annoying but kind of fun at the same time. Don‚Äôt he afraid to take risks with Spotify! Find out what you like and don‚Äôt!
Thumbs up  Cool music Some great stations Recently returned to using this platform So far, A+ 
Buen√≠sima app
Does everything I need it too.
When I play a playlist, it would stop 2 seconds and I have to open the app up and press the button to go to the next song instead of going to the next song itself. That‚Äôs annoying to that every 3 minutes
This app is Lit
No matter how many songs you have on a playlist, Spotify still plays a bunch of songs you didn‚Äôt prompt. (My biggest playlist is around 800 songs and I still get random songs)  There‚Äôs no point in listening to specific albums/playlists/artists because only a small portion of the music you WANT to listen to will actually be played.   Note to Spotify: If I WANTED to hear similar music to a certain artists/playlist/song/album.. I‚Äôd use the RADIO FEATURE y‚Äôall implemented??? 
Really good love Wonderwall great song chief.
Easy to use.
I don‚Äôt like the long ads
√≥timo
I can't even open the app without it crashing. So now, I have a premium membership I can't use even though I've done everything I could to solve the issue, fantastic.
Super useful can use it wherever I go
Buy Spotify Premium
It‚Äôs great to have music all the time! The price is brilliant, I have the ‚Äúfamily‚Äù plan so 5 people can have excess to Spotify. A few times I have had to uninstall Spotify because it gets all wonky, doesn‚Äôt save my music or will not load. Other besides that I recommend Spotify to anyone who loves music!
Awesome
I can't even listen to my own songs anymore I heard one of my songs then it's all suggested tracks.
Go to Amazon music. Amazon is a company that you can trust with customer support you can speak to.   Spotify doesn't allow that. Who knows if the support team from Spotify is the same guy that is viewing your credit card and dispensing it to every hacker. 
Whatever I want I can find....oldies, new releases, full albums it‚Äôs great!
This app is very easy to use, you can play all of your favorite music for free.
It‚Äôs a really great music app you can listen to any album it can gather music from what you prefer to listen to it‚Äôs really good I love it
There are times when it goes to a song, plays ten seconds and then stops. Then for the rest of the day I can‚Äôt play that song at all. Really weird
I love this app more than pandora thnx
You gotta have premium but this app is amazing 99 cents a month is a great deal
It is good because it‚Äôs just like iTunes but you could have 1,000 songs and you have to pay just $15.I give it 4 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è
LOVE ITüëç
One of the by far best music stream apps out there!!!
It‚Äôs a good app. Love the music.... except the skips. I just kind of wish I could skip as many as I want without having to pay for it. But other then the skips you can find pretty much every song on there and doesn‚Äôt usually lag or anything.
It‚Äôs honestly great!
This is so much better than pandora I definitely recommend this 
Hi
Best app ever!!!!
Because Have Everything That like.
Love it‚ù§Ô∏è
Love it
Awesome!!!!!!
I love Spotify
I have just downloaded Spotify and it sure makes it easy to get started, but when it makes you the playlist there are some songs I don‚Äôt want on it but I can‚Äôt figure out how to delete them. Other than that Spotify is great 5 stars.
I wish I had a free trial thou
It‚Äôs pretty good but the only thing was it kept playing the reccomned  music as I tried to play something else the other music wouldn‚Äôt stop
Its gr8 man
Excelente aplicaci√≥n para disfrutar haciendo cualquier cosa s√∫per buena me gusta mucho
i love spotify with all of my heart but i couldn‚Äôt live without premium!!
There‚Äôs so much to find. I absolutely love Spotify!
Me encanta!!!
This is a great app, never had problems with it, the only bad thing about it is when new music comes out it won't hit Spotify until couple days BUT that's depending on the music and who the artist is ,other than that üëåüèΩ
Your the cash I‚Äôm the rubber band
z
It‚Äôs way better then pandora, it‚Äôs actually worth the premium
Outrageous!!! 100MM thumbs up!!!
Cool Algorithm! Great work, guys!
I appreciate the military discount I appreciate you guys never censoring the sounds but still ha ing the option. Being able to download the music then listen to it without a connection is probably the best part about the app. It makes it easy to keep al your favorite tracks a tap away when traveling.
One of the best music apps ever.
Cut the "Waze" bullsh*t please
Great app
Awesome selection great for new music! Shelter by rehterik yes yes yes!! Just one of the new music I‚Äôve found on this app
Crashes while loading on iPod . Tried to delete and reinstall, still doesn‚Äôt load and shuts down. Are you folks at spotiphy working on a fix?
Good stuff
I have yet to search for a song and not find it! Love Spotify!
(I‚Äôm only talking about mobile version here) Overall, Spotify is great... if you have premium. With premium you can do basic tasks that any music app should already have to begin with. Well pretty much I‚Äôm only talking about Shuffle Play. Please provide the ability to turn Shuffle Play OFF. Personally, listening to an album/playlist that isn‚Äôt in order is a huge pet peeve of mine. I‚Äôm sorry but it‚Äôs too frustrating to ignore. I can‚Äôt even use the app.
This is simply the best music app there is!
The new update is horrible. You can‚Äôt play Spotify freely, I‚Äôd rather pay for YouTube red because then you can play both shows and music for a cheaper price. Horrible move.
Easy to use, quick to find your music, and always refreshing your options-it is a quality experience!
The best source of past and present music at my fingertips in an easy to search and find platform. I‚Äôm hooked.
Great selections  But what‚Äôs even better it‚Äôs free with commercials  This is a better app than Pandora when it comes to playlist 
Spotify es lo maximo funciona al üíØ lo amo
I would like a sleep timer function so I can put music on to fall asleep to and not have it play for hours.
ITS AWESOME U EVEN GET A FREE WEEK OF PREMIUM
Way more choices than Apple Music

Loved it
Great app
Loved it! ‚ô•Ô∏è
Doesn't take advantage of the opportunity iPad's larger screen. 
Loving the radio jams!!! Always a hit!
Spotify is a great music streaming app with modern app layout and great songs.
Brand new to Spotify and loving it!
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èthis is very relaxing to listen to while getting home from a rough day or sleeping or even walking around listening to it daily‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èit recommends songs that u may love and u end up to love them
love this app.
Awesome app!!!!!!
When you start off their are barely any ads but after you've listened for a while they play about five 30 second ads in a row-mostly repeats. It drives me crazy. Unless you get a paid subscription, I do not recommend. Just get the free trial for Imusic.
Use it every day.
Better then Apple Music
I highly recommend it
It is a litty
I like it but I don't like how u have to pay to do somethingsüòïüòÅ other wise I actually love it so ya thanks - Maya
As it says :) Jesus loves you
I can‚Äôt live without this app
Best music app I‚Äôve ever used
Love it, no other words needed!!
It took me quite a while to fully transition to Spotify and use Premium, but honestly I don't know how I'd go back at this point. I absolutely love Spotify, and I've found some amazing new music from it. My only hope one day is that they tune the Daily Mixes to be less music I've already been listening to and more new music. One day hopefully. Otherwise it's a fantastic app.  Edit 2/18: I‚Äôve been using Premium for a year and I‚Äôm still a big fan. It‚Äôs definitely been buggy at points (once I had a playlist that absolutely would not delete on one of my laptops), but overall I‚Äôve really enjoyed the service and would recommend. 
Stuff
Works for me
Such a nice app. Easy to use and has a huge selection of music. Way better than Pandora in my opinion.
A++++
No issues at all
Incredible how it learns your listening habits and delivers bands and songs that are match after match that I probably would have never heard of otherwise and the ‚ÄúYour Top Songs 2017‚Äù that are all my top listened to tunes is unreal and I listen to one personal favorite song after another like a perfect mixed tape!! And they‚Äôre constantly updating and innovating the app and I honestly can‚Äôt say enough great things about it, it‚Äôs the best $10 bucks for premium that I spend all all month!!
Very recommended
It‚Äôs really good, the quality is good, the design is good but why you can only use it abroad for 2 weeks? And you can‚Äôt create an account almost everywhere. Please fix it
Great music service even if you do not have premium.
It was awesome when it started but it started to go downhill when Spotify premium started and now there are a bunch of ads in and you can't skip a song is if you don't like the song anymore
Great
Awesome
Spotify is great, full selection and easy to use
I really love this app, it‚Äôs just amazing
The app is great, but I can‚Äôt choose what songs I listen to in my playlist
You‚Äôve come a long way Mijo. Dad is very proud of you. I2J Productions. You gotta here his music.
I can‚Äôt even imagine using another music app. I have no reason to change. It‚Äôs so easy to use and has everything you could ask for.
It's amazing
LOVE this app!! Spotify is free, and it is great to play on a speaker, or preferably my google home! Works great!
I am so happy that I downloaded this app to give it a try. Before Spotify I had Pandora, but I didn‚Äôt really like how Pandora was organized. Pandora was more of a radio. Spotify on the other hand, is amazing because you can create playlist and find other playlist too. So there is no ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know this song.‚Äù Because on my playlist I will know the songs. If I did want to find new song there is a Radio option. This is where it gives you new songs based off of the songs you have in a playlist. I have read a few Reviews and some seemed to be confused with the concept. 
I love the app way better than pandora,but can you make it easier to start an subscription and able to do it in the app.Also can you make it able to use gift cards (iTunes/google play cards) then I would give it a 5 stars rating other than that the app is great
Balls
Enjoying app.  Still learning how to use it
When I click play my music it‚Äôs not mine but the music instead is good
Good succ
I love this app. That‚Äôs all I gotta say
I love it
My go to app for so many things.
I‚Äôm sure premium users have no problem with it anytime it updates. But the most recent time I updated it, there are so many things that I don‚Äôt like. And make the app frustrating. Since I don‚Äôt have premium I can‚Äôt just click on any song to listen to it to see if I like it before saving it. I used to be able to hold my finger down on top of the song and it would play a preview of it, so I could tell if I liked it or not. And now it doesn‚Äôt do that. And also if I couldn‚Äôt tell if I like the song from that preview, I would add it into a playlist all its own and hit shuffle, and it would play that song so I could listen to the whole thing. And now it literally plays anything but that song. So I can‚Äôt even tell if I like the song. The way it‚Äôs set up makes it very hard to find new music, and see if I like the stuff that is new, or that I may have never heard. It‚Äôs very frustrating. My only playlist that actually plays the songs in it, is my one with 165+ songs. Any of my other playlist don‚Äôt play any of the songs that are in it, it only plays suggested. If I wanted to hear those I‚Äôd ask for it. I‚Äôm trying to play the ones from my playlist, because that‚Äôs the one I want to hear. Not listen to 30 suggested songs before even 1 of my songs gets played. Spotify is becoming not a very user friendly app unless you have premium. So I think they need to change that and the app would be 100% better. And so many people would be more satisfied.
Thank you for making listening to music I love so easy.
Lit
Read the title.
I have Spotify premium and it is amazing I can choose from a variety of songs and artists
Why can I choose what song I listen to on my computer on Spotify Web Player but I can‚Äôt choose what song I want on my phone? It just doesn‚Äôt make sense!
Great
I‚Äôm glad I found this App. The music selection is second to none!
This app is amazing you can listen to all of your favorite beats while playing your other game,Sincerely Selena and the Emrey
too many ads
SPOTIFY IS THE DOPEST ON THE ROPEST AND I ENJOY IT A LOT. I also really enjoy having access to premium features but am a poor boi and can‚Äôt afford it every month. Spotify, please. This is a cry for help. I‚Äôm just a cool boi with a hood playlist and want to listen to some sick tunes that keep me going. Please give me free premium features. Love, a Spotify user
Great app!WISH THERE WASNT SO MANY ADS
I love Spotify I can listen to music without having to go on to Apple Music,YouTube. And it plays even when I exit the app!!! I‚Äôm with Spotify üíØ%
üòÆ can play your own music while playing games!
It would be better if you play the song instead of playing a shuffle that doesn‚Äôt even have the song your looking for in it
best music archive.
Yassss
Top
Love it
No ads
So easy to us and much more option than pandora. I‚Äôm all in!
One of the best free music apps. Very little interruption for ads.
I think it‚Äôs the new update, but as of recently it crashes a lot if you rearrange things in your queue. And despite shuffling my music, it would only play A-B songs, and when I select a song from any other part of the alphabet, it‚Äôll only play songs from that group. It‚Äôs really weird, can I turn that off?
Doesn‚Äôt allow you to have unlimited skips as well as choose the song without paying for Premium. Also has ads that you aren‚Äôt allowed to skip. Otherwise the app is amazing and has a wide selections of songs, even in other languages.
I think this app is AMAZING!!!! But, one thing that needs to become more accessible is changing the playlist image. I have Spotify on mobile and my Chromebook, and right now the image can only be changed on desktop. Something that could take the app to new heights is expanding the ability to change the image to all laptop kinds and possibly even mobile phones!!! PLEASE CONSIDER.
Ok good
Love this app no complaints at all
Very good
Awesome app. No flaws.
Good
yeahhhhh
Thank you for who ever made Spotify, now I can listen to music one my Xbox instead of doing it off my phone!!! You deserve 5 Stars
This app is amazing it's free and I listen to all my music on hereü§£ü§§
Love it!
I love Spotify the team has done great but it would be sooooo good if they made a Apple Watch version. it will make it so easy to play when you have a watch version. If they do then I will for sure give Spotify a solid 5 stars and for sure suggest Spotify to everyone I know that doesn‚Äôt already have it
Love the mix!
Tight
Great music app!
I love this app, I‚Äôve never had one issue with them even when I was charged for accidentally going into the next month without canceling the issue was resolved. It‚Äôs great for keeping up with hits in any part of the world and discovering new songs to love.
So good! So good! So good! So good! So good!
I love Spotify but I found Macklemore and I was so blessed to here him I‚Äôm freaking crying because he‚Äôs speaks the truth in his song just please put more of his songs on here often bc I love him way more then Beyonc√© üòÇ
Perfectly recommended
its a great music app!
Spotify premium is probably the best thing I‚Äôve ever used for music
how did I live without it? my entire musical library on demand
La mejor app de m√∫sica
Best music app
Love it
why haven‚Äôt i used this sooner?!
They create beautiful playlists for me and I love them. Beautiful sounds and quality, easy to use. I love the discount for college students and the added Hulu. LOVE!
Great app!
Nignog
So first of all I really hate the suggested tracks feature. I listened to over an hour of my playlist and got guess how many.... ZERO songs from my actual playlist. I‚Äôm very disappointed in this feature, and that Spotify doesn‚Äôt even seem to even CARE about what it‚Äôs users think. I used my free trial of Spotify and once it ended i was like oh well no offline from my playlists.... NOPE! No FRICKIN MUSIC FROM MY PLAYLISTS! ALSO! Spotify offered me 60 day of premium and I was like heck yes but NO! The link brought me to their website, and It didn‚Äôt Marion anything about this ‚Äúfree‚Äù 60 days. I couldn‚Äôt even tap anything. There was no links on that website like what lies are these Spotify?
I like my Spotify but whenever I try to listen to my songs I do until a little later when it plays a bunch of crap.
Just about to get the premium version.
This is amazing I would recommend this instead of Pandora....
Love it
Spotify is awesome because I can listen to any music I want
Spotify is amazing it has any song you want
I love Spotify
Yessd
Its a really food app but wish i can afford premium but hey free songs
This app works great and I use it daily for over 12 hours a day 6 days a week between my commute and my entire work day. Everything about the app works(ed) until the recent iOS and also app updates. No longer can I control playback AT ALL outside of volume from my Apple Watch. As a customer paying for the app over a span of close to 7 years, losing that convenience is a big deal, should I be forced to work with headphones do to the job I might be involved in. Will throw a 5th star up once this inconvenience is resolved.
It can connect to PS4 and play through ur gaming headset while u play that's awesome
Love app and very easy to use!!
Fully recommended!!
Very good
Love listening to my play lists.
I want to be able to tap the song
Is good, also that black panther album mega fire
Yep.
Such a great app. Features many uses and has over thousands of songs. Strongly recommend this app.
I would give it 5 stars but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way to view lyrics. I think it would be a great addition to an already great app. The premium is pricey but worth it for the features it gives you. I would definitely recommend.
Bbbbooooorrrrriiiiiiiiiiinnnnnggg culo
This app it asome I could here the music with out internet.
Been using this app for 3 years now, and just recently has my shuffle only been playing my most recently added songs and nothing else. Please fix, it‚Äôs quite bothersome
It‚Äôs good I like it download it if u a cool kid
Sexiest app alive
This keeps me up with the new music.
I really like this app, but it‚Äôs not fair to those without premium. I believe that their should be a DELETE BUTTON! Because otherwise I have to REDO THE ENTIRE PLAYLIST which sometimes has like 200 songs... üò° irritating. But for those without premium you should seriously think about giving them the choice of what they want to listen to, instead of it skipping around, or playing music that isn‚Äôt even theirs. Cuz that‚Äôs even more irritating üò° Also, is their a way to turn off the behind the lyrics? It gets annoying when I‚Äôm looking at the picture, and it shows the behind the lyrics thingy-majig. But good app, and plz think about these problemz!
Takes me back in time. Thanks
Great music app
Although there are many ads on the non premium version it is understandable since it is advertising itself. 9.5/10 times it works flawlessly provided amazing music when I need it. Most definitely I would recommend it to someone because of its efficiency.
No deja pagar la versi√≥n premium es p√©sima dan muchos anuncios no la recomiendo NADA Aparte aunqu pagues la versi√≥n premium te dice que no est√° pagada y mi te deja usarla es puro robo esta app üëéüèΩüëéüèΩüëéüèΩ 
This thing is great. I love to browse and find out new bands
No words
I've been using Spotify for years now. This iPhone & iPad now are better than ever. I have a family subscription with my sister and we both love it!
Worst music app
What i like about Spotify is they have all the songs that i ask for and if i saw without bad words it comes up without bad words
Great app
I have been using Spotify for 5 years and I have never got tired of it. Totally worth it!
Absolutely worth paying for!
I like it
Enjoy the variety. Not a fan of the search results.
Recently played list needs to have configurable length. I need it to be much longer.
Please update Spotify library! I‚Äôve had premium for a year and there are still singles listed under albums. I can‚Äôt delete an artist. It is not that easy to navigate and adjust settings. Recently played list has songs that I don‚Äôt care to see again. Needs a major renovation!
I love this app and I don't use anything else to listen to my favorite songs. The Daily Mixes and Discover Weekly are designed perfectly for you and are so great. Love this appüòç‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è  Although I really think they should put less limits on the free version because lots of people can't afford the premium!
excellent app to use for music selection of a wide array!!
I can get to all my favorite songs, but I wish you could get unlimited without membership
Yeah
My boyfriend turned me on to Spotify and I really liked it. It‚Äôs easy to use and they have tons of music to choose from! I started with a free 60 day trial but I plan on paying the $9.99 a month for the service once my trial is over.
Best music streaming app out there!
Awesome
Keeps my phone storage free of endless songs, easy to use interface. Extremely happy!
300/10
I love the app, and I use it frequently but when I updated phones and went to reload it on to my current phone, something weird happened...  I CANT LOG IN AMYMORE. Like I hit the button to sign in and nothing happens. Come on Spotify, you‚Äôre a great music site and I want to be able to listen to you again! 
Greatüòäüòäüòä
Awesome as a possum
Very good indeed
The mobile app is trash unless you pay for premium. The desktop app is by far way superior.
this is nice have had it for years
Awesome all the way around
Excelente
I love Spotify, and I use it on a regular basis. But paying for premium and not getting access to it on my Apple Watch is frustrating, because I can‚Äôt listen to what I want to without paying for each song. Please add Apple Watch support! 
Great App
ü§õb
Es perfectos para las fiesta
It is great u can still listen to music when u r not on the app or turn off ur phone
I loved it it is a little difficult with the skips but still awesome I loved it sooo much üòçüòç
I love how you don't have to pay for the songs
I love Spotify premium. Without premium it‚Äôs not that great but premium is everything musical id ever need and the format is great
Downloaded this app in hopes to create a playlist for my wedding and it exceeded my expectations!
It is a Great app and I have all my favorite music right there, but I think there‚Äôs something wrong with the app.. I tried to get on it and it completely froze. I closed the app continuously and it is still froze. Please fix this.
This app is the best!!!!!
Thanks for making this app so happy üòáüòç
I love this app
Love this app so much
Works great
its good
Honestly this is the best music app I've ever had.
It needs to have unlimited skips for free we pay for WiFi so it should be free üòé
Keep it up.
Awesome app
Awesome
I would prefer this to Apple Music or pandora any day
great!!
Tomabo
please bring back the download section under "My Library".. this doesn't improve anyone's app experience? Please fix.
Best app so far !!!
ESy to use and lets you listen to anything you want. Saves money when you want to listen to someone new.
Perfect for casual listening and for finding new content!
Love I can create a list :)
They got the music I like and that‚Äôs kickass
Best music app I have found some far thank you
It‚Äôs ok. I just don‚Äôt like how they want you to pay for EVERYTHING üò°
Use it
Great app I‚Äôm gonna start paying for it
I LUV SPOTIFY!!!!üíïüíï
Its amazing i really like this app
It‚Äôs a great app, but too frequently it skips around randomly and disrupts my listening.
I am 100 Perfect satisfied with his app.
Easy to use, premium is the jam!my fav music,whenever,however & whatever I want.Great app
The service is amazing. The app needs work. A little clunky and slow when there is no internet connection.
Never stops working
This app is outstanding if your premium then no adds and I can download what I want
Fantastic app. Very easy to use and their selection of bands and albums is very wide
It‚Äôs great I love Spotify! Simply!
This app is good but the adds are too much !
Daily app that everyone needs!
This App Is Nice
Baiyley at the everettmallway store was very helpful and when I told her about my situation she made sure to give me the right information and recommendations to figure things out.
It‚Äôs fast to download and I luv the music.üòòüòò
I am a premium. and it‚Äôs great also it‚Äôs a great price too
This app is so awesome, I am so happy to have found it, my fav part is the ability to play all music from many of my favorite artists, as well as the suggested playlists, they are too very good and meet most all music interests! Still listening!
Love it. Easy to use
hey spotify is pretty cool lol, except that I need premium if I wanna do anything cool but its better than pandora
Love it! Going to get the premium version if I can figure out how to do it lol
Love this!!
Gotta love music to go music you can share
Spotify is a family favorite!
üòãüòãüòã
u guys make it so difficult to do anything on this app!! i don't understand how it'd benefit anyone to take away the downloads tab AND the daily mix tab?? now i literally have to hunt thru everything i have just to find anything??? and we STILL can't save 1 song at a time?? like who made this app?
üí©‚Äôsüí£
S√∫per recomendado
Still my favorite platform for music.
Great music good times
yeah it's been great so far, but i just haven't been able to keep it for long due to my low storage:(
Please make artwork bigger and enable landscape mode. Then it would be 5 stars.
To support the artists!!
love the playlists
Love it
New..real good...feel good music! Love it.
Great music app!
So great!!!!!!!!!! 10/10 can Listen to anything!!!!!!
Absolutely love Spotify and have been using it for years but i hate how every time the app updates i have to re-download all of my saved songs
IT‚ÄôS AWESOME.
I love it
Whether you have the upgrade or not this music app is 10/10
This is a great service at a great price
I‚Äôve been using Spotify since 2009, and I‚Äôve recently had an issue with 2 monthly payments coming out of my bank account every month. Can‚Äôt email, no customer service phone number, no chat. You cannot reach anyone and for that, I had to cancel my subscription.
I enjoy this way more than pandora
Spotify has been my favorite way to listen to music yet!! Every song I can think of it offered and the easy use is perfect!
It‚Äôs 2018 iPhones are larger and most apps should over landscape especially one I pay a monthly subscription for. Can‚Äôt be that hard to add this feature.
Even as a blind person I can fully use this app and I really like that.
It plays good recommended songs while I play my games and gets me pumped.
Wooooooow
I used the Downloads section while on the road every day so I would t go through my data too quick. Last update removed the Downloads folder from my library. So now I have to filter or browse for my offline music.  Also, sometimes I add some of my own local music, going through the tedious process of browsing to it on a laptop, syncing it so it shows up on my phone. Then it disappears for no reason. 
My husband and i share a spotify account that we pay for monthly. As of this morning (2/12) i was logged out and am unable to log in through the app, web browser or desktop. EVERYTHING IS ENTERED CORRECTLY. My husband was able to log into the app through his phone, but he isn‚Äôt able to log into his account through his desktop. His error says there‚Äôs no internet connection. I‚Äôm not receiving that problem, i only receive ‚ÄúError Code 412‚Äù and ‚ÄúError Code 404‚Äù unable to login. My husband has a Samsung Galaxy 6 Edge and I have an Iphone 6S...We were not having any problems yesterday!  Help help help help help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Best music app!!
Spoko
Going off line then taking too long to reload playlist
Listen to it like all the time!!!
I love Spotify, it makes me mad that the #Echo Spot from Amazon makes it impossible to use it
Spotify definitely takes the cake when it comes to streaming
Having fun
Amazing
I like it Spotify app it worked
I enjoy Spotify so much! Great App!
Almost every update removes downloaded music. When you have a few thousand songs downloaded, this gets to be incredibly frustrating.
Spotify genuinely makes me happy
I had to log in and all my songs were still there and I am HAPPY
100% top
And now I can‚Äôt listen to a d*mn song without a heck ton of ads, it‚Äôs frustrating and I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it anymore
So much better than Pandora! I use it every day and listen to podcast all the time!
We finally have tunes out on the water!
Wish they had a thing for premium payment regularly show up
Spotify is part of my daily life.  I use it to pray , meditate , relax , workout and keep going
This has got to be the best of app music, ads won‚Äôt hurt to listen for free. I think it‚Äôs number 1 on my music list.
This is awesome
This app has improved dramatically.  Would still like to be able to have a way to search playlists when adding a track by alphabetical order, but other than that, I'm digging the app a lot.
All songs are here!! At least to my taste, which is a wide variety!
That‚Äôs it. No questions asked. Any album, song, make a playlist, a few ads and it‚Äôs enjoyable. Considering premium just because I love it that much!
B√∫a aplicaci√≥n
Amazing so easy to use
I like being able to group my sprint Samsung Galaxy songs together.
So much better then I heart, pandora and all th3 other playlists apps out there for music. I‚Äôm an album kind of guy so I can just chose the albums i want to listen to and listen that‚Äôs the best part for me.
It was a great family gift
i wish i had premium
Xbox is okay but on phone I can‚Äôt even listen to something in order or start in the middle of a playlist
I used my IPhone 6 Plus, Mini IPad 6 Plus, Beats Ep Headphones, IPod 6 Plus, Sprint Samsung Htc Phone 6 & Green IPod on Tuesday August 21st, 2007 with my mom in 2007.  From, Bryan Stanard  Sent from my IPhone. 
Very impressed. Wish I got this app sooner.
Love this app.
A great way to spend my day :).
I use it all the time, it‚Äôs pretty great.
Was able to sign up for $0.99, in a 3-month holiday deal. Have been LOVING it! Thanks, Spotify!
Would totally recommend
Exlente aplicaci√≥n
My longest paid subscription to anything... love this app...
I absolutely ‚ÄúLOVE‚Äù Spotify and if I wasn‚Äôt on a fixed income I would definitely purchase the full version!  Trust me!
So I use this every single day and I love it, but it plays the same songs over and over again! I have over a hundred songs bhs and it plays the same 10 songs! Also I‚Äôve come to realize they all have behind the lyrics connected to them. So I would guess Spotify is getting money off of genius lyrics when they use their behind the lyrics. That would make me guess that if they keep playing the ones with genius lyrics connected they are desperate for money. It looks kind of sad.
It‚Äôs great! Plays the music that I like, and doesn‚Äôt stray from my selections.
This app limits saved music to 10000 songs why? Apple Music is unlimited. Release the limit and I will rate 5 stars other than that love the eq sound
if my music would shuffle property 5 stars.
Spotify is so good it has any song and even with no premium it alright
Really good
I love the 30 minutes segments without interruption or commercials. I love the ease at which you can identify groupings of music with ease.
This would be a 5-star review if not for the crashing that happens whenever I listen to albums with visuals (E.g. Culture 2). There should be an option to turn these song videos off & just see album cover instead, as I have an iPhone 8+ & it still crashes.
Great DL features Easy to use Get the family plan 
I love it
Best thing ever
Awesome
This app is numba 1
Really great
Spotify asked me to review, so here I am, reviewing. I do actually like Spotify, lots of good music. Helps me not lose my phone when I put it down, and keeps me up to date on Western music. 
The songs are like reliving the old times and I am just loving it.
Nice
This app is one of the most useful app to listen musics in America
Convenient, genius.
It‚Äôs awesome
Really enjoy it
Game over. ;)
Where have you been all this time?
So far I like its function.
I love this app . Spotify is the best music app ever !! I love it
Has always been my only go to for music
Must have App!
it‚Äôs great
I love Spotify as a whole and how you can save music and make playlists, but when I shuffle a playlist, it just plays suggested songs instead of what I actually saved. If there could be an option where you can turn that off, that would be great. Also, if Spotify had a sleep timer, that would be amazing. I find myself playing a playlist on Spotify, and then switching to Pandora just so that my music doesn‚Äôt play all night long.
Spotify needs to add more songs.For example, a lot of people like the album Mystery Skulls and they have all the sings except one,the ‚ÄúFreaking out‚Äù song.Its one of my favorites but I can‚Äôt listen to it without playing on another device.ADD MORE FREAKING SINGS ALREADY!!!!!
Muy bien
Spotify is the shizznit!!!!!!
Best music app ever!
I love music and spotify lets me listen to what I want when I want, amazing app, billion dollar idea, major props
Love it
Amaazingg ah
Is simple and you can get free music
After years of using I heart radio jukebox and Pandora I have come to the conclusion that this is by far one of the best apps to stream music on
Great just but too many ads
Spotify contains the music to my heart.
Would really be an awesome feature if you had a visualizer.

Nice
I love this app. There you go.
issa dope maun 10/10 recc premium
Great set of music for low monthly fee.  Not bad and I like the icon colours
I love this app so much! I use this on a daily basis, it‚Äôs so easy and fun to use.
Awesome program for listening to music
Great
I am surprised to see that so much flexibility given to free account users. The music recommendation engine and the UI look solid too. Thanks so much Spotify!
Love your service
I love this app
Spotify is so great, it‚Äôs my first music app choice!!
Spotify is the best music app I have used! Worth 5 stars for sure!
Greatest variety I‚Äôve found so far
This is a great music app it has every good playlist and artist.
The first time I used it I‚Äôll be honest it was pretty honest but I joined the family planned and it truly changed in a way and so I started listening to music on Spotify
Estable y muy buena calidad de straming
love it
Spotify is awesome
I just love how this app can provide the perfect song and or playlist for whatever mood I'm in. They also have the old school music that takes me back to better times and even songs that make my day just from the start til the end of the night. This app literally have saved my life many times so Spotify team that work to make this wonderful app the best invention until the music app industry you do not know how grateful I am towards Y'all.
I know Spotify is wanting you to pay for their service, and I can totally agree with wanting to have some functions not be implemented without paying, but I would at least expect to listen to the song I want, rather than hoping I get the song I want based off of a randomly generated number.
It is so good but put more songs
This is a wonderful app!
I love Spotify, I can find almost everything I can think of.
The only complain I would have is the price for the Premium service, but since I have this app I can't stop using it..it have a playlist for every aspect of my life!
I‚Äôve been using this app for a few years and I loved it until recently. I hate making a playlist and not even hearing any of the music on it. I, personally, love musicals and try to listen to my favorites but I can‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt want to hear music from rappers when I‚Äôm listening to the music I was hoping I could hear. Also, I don‚Äôt appreciate getting false advertisement. I can‚Äôt be told to listen to an ad and get 30 minutes of ad-free music but have to sit through 5 ads, listen to three songs and get another 4 ads. I would really love to see a listen history. I don‚Äôt have premium and I usually leave my music playing off my speaker and phone when I leave the room so if I come back at the end of the song, and I like it, I want to be able to come back and find the song.
Love it. I use it all of the time
Better than Apple Music I feel after trying them both. Streamlined interface. Nice audio quality options .
Yayyyy
It‚Äôs great for listening to music
Great app!
I honestly am liking Spotify a lot more than Apple Music
I can choose every song and singer the way I want; and the advertising is well structured by giving me half an hour free of them. We listen one once in a while. It ones not bother much. I can take it this way.  Spotify is not like others that force me to stay listening songs that I do not like.  Thank for the free style of providing us good music.
Worth every penny! Selections new discoveries it‚Äôs all here. Apple iTunes blows!
Poo
I wish Spotify Premium was for free But without like the 7 day free trial 
Lo q buscaba
Great application, easy to use.
Great all I got to say
Only problem I‚Äôm having with Spotify is that when you want your songs played in order of recently added, it automatically shuffle plays. Other than that annoying issue it‚Äôs a great app!
So far, very impressed!
Spotify is really only worth getting if you‚Äôre able to buy premium, in my opinion anyways. I just started using premium for family and it‚Äôs worth the money saving. The only thing I didn‚Äôt really like was the constant ads that Spotify give you urging you to get premium, was kind of annoying tbh. Besides that, worth getting ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
My son recommended, and we are spreading the love of Spotify throughout our extended family!  Thanks for everything, Spotify! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è 
Definitely a wise choice for those who wish to release their shackles of the iPhone. I thought it was too late since I was so settled but thankfully Spotify has a thing that allows you to download local files to get rid of all the hassle. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND
I love the customization and the variety. I listen to the music and podcasts. I make my own  extensive play lists and take full advantage of not having any commercials. My favorite music app ever!
Great variety of music. It is FREE. THANK YOU SPOTIFY
Very nice, easy to navigate, all a person needs for music
Human tested, Satan approved.
I get to listen to all my fav songs
iT IS FREE you don't need to pay
I have been using Spotify for 3 years and I really love it!

Good musical app
Awesome best way to listen to my favorite music
This app is so good because you can listen to music for free. One thing though ads may just be a slight problem so... I don't care it gives me music, but still update this please or fix!
Worth the subscription
Best contribution to music in the last decade
i was leaving on a week trip and needed offline music bad and this was perfect!
Literally the best app out there
Every time I update Spotify it has to re-download all the songs that were already on my phone. Why!!!! This alone has made me want to stop paying for premium.  Still happening. As of 2/11/2018 
I like this app because you can listen to any song you love, for free.
Awesome for listening to music
I love u
This is by far the best paid for app I've owned. The fact that I can pick and choose any song and download to play while offline makes it well worth it.
Have my whole libraries of songs and make new playlists each month. Download on phone etc. AWESOME
This app is beyond marvelous.
easy to create wonderful playlists
I think its ok i like it but its just that you want a song but they put a different one
Easy to use
My only complaint is that you‚Äôre locked on shuffle play without a subscription üôÅ
Title says it all.
I've used this app for like 6 years and it was perfect but now when I'm listening to a song and I go to see what songs are next my pressing the list thing at the top it won't do anything , like I press it multiple times too so it's useless that's really the only thing I find wrong
When I play my playlist, it plays random suggested songs and won't ever go back to my music. It it very annoying and impractical. The final thing was I recently attempted to purchase Spotify premium but it was near impossible to find. Once I found it, it took me to a  official Spotify page on safari and I STILL couldn't find the information. I gave up trying and ended up waisting 40min. It 
this app is great but my only complaint is they should let us change the pictures of our playlists/profile pics on mobile. some broke fellas without computers still want our playlists looking good
Es √∫nico amigos (as)
Love app. Live app. Shook Shrek 
I love it!
Love Spotify... all my Shazam tracks are in one place!
U can still play your music after it turns off!!! THANK YOU SPOTIFY!!
Awesome
Wo amazing look ok at this
I‚Äôve switched from pandora to Spotify per recommendation of my daughter and am never going back. With occasional 30 minutes of no commercials and repeats and more control of MY music I‚Äôm lovin‚Äô it!!! Thank you spotify!!!
Just love everything
Spotify is by far the worst app I have ever used for music. DO NOT USE THIS CRAP. you can‚Äôt even play a song you want! You have to put it on ‚Äúshuffle.‚Äù Ok, so I want to hear a specific song. Nope doesn‚Äôt let you play it! Ok, I‚Äôll just put it in its own playlist and hit shuffle play. That‚Äôs gotta work right? NOPE, DOESNT EVEN PLAY IT. GREAT. THANKS SPOTIFY, YOU USED TO BE GREAT.
This app that's. very nice I. Loved
This app is so amazing! It‚Äôs everything I‚Äôve ever wanted in a music app ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Love it. Best in class. And best out of class.
Honestly this app is so great it's so reliable when you're sad, happy, mad, working out, at a party, or just chilling. This app is great and everyone should have it.
Sign up for premium
Interesting and enjoyable music
Really good service
Amazing!! As long as it doesn‚Äôt glitch. Then you have to delete and reinstall the app, then log in again üò¢  I little pain...... but come on, the family plan..... unlimited downloads! (Depending on the available gigs in the device) Still amazing! 
Much much better.  It‚Äôs heaven for music lovers 
"Watch this short video for 30 minutes of ad free music!" *plays four 30-second videos, each one made by Spotify* *plays less than 10 minutes of music* It seems that with every update, Spotify adds more advertisements but gets less companies to advertise!  2018 Update: If Spotify could play at least one song from a playlist instead of throwing in some suggested trash, that‚Äôd be great. Thanks. 
My 16 year old daughter finally talked me into trying Spotify and I‚Äôm an IDIOT for not trying it sooner. Goodbye iTunes! You were great 8 years ago but I‚Äôm done with your horrible interface. Spotify is to music what Uber was to ride-sharing.
I made a playlist a week later I can not even get into the app u should not get this trash appüôÅüôÅthis is a poor app
Spotify keeps stopping, skipping and playing songs on its own, EVEN WHEN I CLOSE THE APP.  I have tried several things posted online including a clean delete and re-install.  It actually got worse.  This has been happening for weeks.  Fix this
Best music app to listen to all my favorite music. Been using for 3 years now.
I love Spotify so much and appreciate everything about it!
Spotify is the best music üé∂ app now üíì You can listen without having to pay. 
good
Yup
You‚Äôre seriously reading reviews about Spotify?
Toda tu m√∫sica en una sola app . Nice :)
Love
DESERVES 5 STARS
I love using Spotify!üòâ
Very user friendly with a very large selection of songs.
Is the best app of this world! You can find any song or singer that you want! 100% recommended
Already addicted :-)
I really enjoy Spotify. Even gives you the ability to adjust things like the Bass and Treble. It‚Äôs a great App!
I like it it‚Äôs just how do you buy premium without using your bank account if I have to use my bank account please remove that because I rather use my iTunes card
Erinllbrathn
This is a greAT APP.
Good but one problem is you have to pay for premium which is ok but if you don‚Äôt have the money then it ruins it. Other than that it‚Äôs great so I‚Äôll leave a 4 star.
Best music platform out there. I‚Äôm not kidding.
Get all the music I want and like to hear
You should download this app it‚Äôs great when u have premium
Love Spotify, easy listen to all my favorite music
All the music I love
I have left a handful of times to try whatever new product had come out and u always come back. Now they were on a family plan, my house would riot if I tried to do so again! We love us some Spotify.
Get it...it's 5 stars....why do you not have it yet, its been out for years....
üé∂Omg this is so awesome love itüé∂
Perfect
This is so much better than the other apps out there
I really like Spotify because it just knows exactly what kind of songs you like. Also you could discover new artists that you didn‚Äôt even know about before. Although it is really good I don‚Äôt like that  it limits you as well ,for not paying Spotify premium. For example it doesn‚Äôt let you skip some songs and it has a lot of ads.Other than that I really enjoy this app you should download it.
Very cool
Sweet jamsü§ó
Listen to it every day.
New music everyday!
Best music app
Great just great
It needs to go offline. SoundCloud says it can‚Äôt go offline but, It acually can.. 
It is awesome you can listen to free music
Love my options here.Stores my lists and favorites.Very large selection.Great
Love ‚ù£Ô∏è
I‚Äôve been a Spotify user for that last few years, and I love it. Their discover weekly and release radar playlists always have new fresh music that I love. Keep it up Spotify, you‚Äôre killin‚Äô it.
This is the greatest music app I‚Äôve gotten! I highly recommend it!!!
Greattttttt
Great Selectionü§°üëåüèªüòé
I used to listen to Pandora. But ever since I discovered Spotify, I completely stopped listening to Pandora. I love how I get to have more customization in my playlists and what I want to listen to.
Could be happier with the app. Must go premium though!
Better than Apple Music.
Spotify has all the new songs in just a few moments and has albums that have your favorite songs and you can make your own albums!
It been good to me rlly I just need premium and we good they just need to get every artist album other than that this app is one of my favorites
This app is better than pandora honestly!
Spotify is dope I just wish it was cheaper and had a family plan like apple music .
Excelente app
nuff said.
This is an amazing app I love listening to my favorite songs! But on the phone it won‚Äôt let you chose you have to do shuffle. I hope you will fix it. But good appüëçüèº
Great classic!
I love it.
Awesome!!
Loveeee Spotify... definitely worth the price for the membership to me
After 5 years of pandora and its B sides only mixed with irrelevant artists I‚Äôve come to enjoy the music and range that Spotify offerd
It would be PERRRRFECT   1000%  IF I FIND HOWWWWWW TO     S H A R E   SONGS!!      ?????????????
It serves the purpose well. 5 stars, I'd recommend it to anyone
Works great!!!!
Love it!
Goat!!
dis is the best app for listening to music
Spotify is great. Works well for me. Has lots of choices and good playlists. Plus it works on PS4 perfectly.
I love Spotify Premium, but without it....the ads are so frustrating and annoying. The ads from Spotify are absolutely awful
This is a fantastic app
This app is what gets me though school. School is confusing and annoying but when I listen to music I can just not worry and when I play music I even do better on work bc it is enjoyable
I love it even if I don‚Äôt have premium.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòÅüòÅ
Love this app!
Best
I like pandora - but that‚Äôs useless outside USA  and I travel a lot so Spotify has the ability to work everywhere- huge selection- I listen to lots of stuff you can‚Äôt find elsewhere - Spotify has it- easy UI - works well - love it
Better than Pandora!!!!
My wife has Spotify loaded on her phone. This is such an Awesome App. Loaded it 30 minutes ago, should have downloaded it months ago. Great, Super, etc. etc.  Keep up the great work.
Seriously, why would I use a different music app? I only wish I could customize more things. Also, I would like for you to stop removing certain albums!
I  L O V E  I T 
I can
I think that Spotify is great for all your music needs
This is a great app and I think if I were you, I will get it! It‚Äôs all free! Head up, Spotify plat. Or something cost money which is a upgrade or something. This app will still play that music you were playing so if you are playing Minecraft or something, it will still play it for you!
I just love it ‚ù§Ô∏è
Very good
great songs great quality
Awesome I like it along with Apple Music too ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Ok, I know this doesn‚Äôt happen if you have premium, but I don‚Äôt have the money for it and use Spotify a lot. I usually shuffle albums and playlists (don‚Äôt get me started on the ‚Äúyou can only shuffle‚Äù thing,) and it‚Äôll play 3-4 of the songs, then about 5 songs that aren‚Äôt even in the list or by the artist. What‚Äôs the point of even using this app if it doesn‚Äôt play the music I want and I run out of skips if I even try to skip to the list I wanted? People that can‚Äôt pay for premium shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with this nonsense. Just give me more ads I don‚Äôt care as long as I can actually listen to what I wanted without a bunch of songs I don‚Äôt like in between.
Great app!
FAVVVVVORITEEEE YASSSSSS
Great music
Awesome app some the best playlists on the Web.
Very little adds I love it except the fact that it has only Japanese versions of twice songs. Other than that it‚Äôs great!!
es muy great
Best music app
great app!!!
Awesome best music app ever!!üòÄ
Love the 80's and selections have been great to reminisce!!
Especially for bluegrass they have hundreds of covers of various songs by so many different artists. Search one song and listen for hours due to all the artists that cover it!
Latino
Do it. Spotify.
I buy the gift cards to help pay for premium and select all the songs I love. Worth it.
Only been using the service for about 3 months now, so far it‚Äôs awesome.
It is a great app.
It is so GOOD
The best!
St the end of the year spotify picks out your tip listened to tracks and makes a custom playlist just for you and boy is it awesome being reminded of your favorite tracks from the beginning of the year
The latest update of this app is buggy, volume control does not show up all the time and when it does the music info disappears and then the volume control disappear completely. Please fix as soon as possible.
Other than this one thing, this app is great. While premium is definitely worth it, I wasn‚Äôt necessarily a fan of ramping up the ads as I continued with my regular subscription. Understandably it was for making money, which is commendable, but it seemed like as time went on, more and more ads kept popping up more and more often as an attempt to get people to  update...  Also, I liked it when they had the specific dates of each songs release... 
Sometimes my friends don‚Äôt like a song so I try to skip but guess what. My music gets turned off because somebody didn‚Äôt like a song and I couldn‚Äôt skip it.
Works good
I really like it
Love how easy this app is to use.. paired w my sonos and my music plays perfectly
:)
It‚Äôs a nice app the only thing I don‚Äôt like about it is that it has ads.
Best app in the world
Great app, and most up to date!
I love Spotify I honestly think it‚Äôs better than Pandoras
I give it 3 stars because most of my songs won‚Äôt play, and most are my favorite. They play for 11 seconds and then they auto skip or they just won‚Äôt play and I forced to skip. Please fix this. This is becoming an issue and ruining the experience of the app for me.
I like the app a lot but I can‚Äôt delete songs from my playlists that I don‚Äôt like anymore and I still have to deal with it
Me gusta esta app por ser completa en todo
üíï
The music sounds great, the playlist are easy, and the ability to download them is awesome.
it‚Äôs great
Spotify has really good music that I can listen to, and all the features are really nice and easy to use. Sometimes they can be difficult, but otherwise I suggest Spotify is your first choice for an app for music!
You get a 7 day free trial with no credit card needed. Girllllll it‚Äôs my time to take advantage üòõ.
It‚Äôs dope get it
BEST MUSIC APP EVER
I‚Äôm in 2018 and I got to listen to steal my sunshine, semi-charmed life, and Sugar Ray all in one playlist. That I didn‚Äôt have to make. Technology is great.
I love Spotify & you should keep this app!!
Totally worth it.
WHAT THE TITLE SAYS! ITS GOOD AF
Need a filter for explicit songs.  Apparently this has been in the works since 2012. Not kewl.    I‚Äôm told by an insider that it‚Äôs not a technology challenge but actually a contractual and financial issue.  Ok. But 6 years to commit and not come through.  Really? 
The only reason why I‚Äôm rating it 5 stars is Because you can listen to free music.
This app is amazing.This was my first time using it and it was amazing, keep up the good work!
Easy to use, good materialistic style of layout
Excellent
Love my Spotify!
Great!
Better than Pandora atleast
Fire! üî•üî•üî•
Love this app. I‚Äôm using it 24/7
I love that you can build your own playlists. I finally feel I don‚Äôt need my 500 cd‚Äôs anymore.
i like the matches they make and easy to use.
This great app allows me to listen to my favorite songs and more! Thanks Spotify üíö

I absolutely love Spotify.
I love this app so much
One of the best apps in the App Store legit gets me thru my days happy sad or tired
I am so excited about listening to my favorite songs and finding new songs to love on Spotify!
One thing u could do is have Spotify  be offline with no internet but still be working with songs playing.
This is the best music app out there. I left for a while and I got a new phone. Got an iPhone so I tried Apple Music. I was very disappointed in their lack of Artist, songs, pretty much everything. I finally got back on Spotify, I couldn‚Äôt be happier right now. There are songs on there I‚Äôve been trying to find on other apps and could never find. Also when I was trying to get back on Spotify. I had to send an email to retrieve my info. They responded back within 10 minutes or so. Got everything going again and had a very  quick response. I will be a customer for life with that kinda service and getting most music that pops in my head. I will be recommending Spotify to all my friends, convincing others to change from their other services.‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
Good asf
Best music app ever.
It‚Äôs good.
I used to play Spotify... then I took an arrow to the knee  Pretty cool game tho 
Love it but just to many adds for those who don‚Äôt have ungraded to Spotify premium üòí
Never have any problems... very satisfied.
Way better then soundcloud. If soundcloud doesn‚Äôt have the song you want then it has dumb remixes of the songs but spotify has almost ALL of the songs you want to listen to.
I absolutely love listening to music, and this gives me the opportunity to do it however I want. I can make a ton of playlists to organize my music, and follow others so I don‚Äôt have to do all the sorting myself! I love syncing it up to my house or even just listening with earbuds while playing another game.
Very fat service
Amazing!!! I wish that it was free!
Many to choose from. 10/10 :)
It‚Äôs a good music app
Spotify Premium is very smooth and has worked extremely well for me. Except for the somewhat over priced monthly fee- it‚Äôs a great app!
So much better then Pandora!!!!üëçüèªüëçüèªüòÅ
It's cool
This is the best app to listen to music on, you can make your own playlists by adding any artist you want. My playlist has more than 30 artist on it, it‚Äôs a lot better than having to pay for the music. This app is 100% useful, you don‚Äôt need internet for it. So far I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with it.
It is amazing has great technology for everything that on the app I love specify
Spotify is a cool listing app and station .enjoy making my own list of many different genre,s
very good app.. usefull.. easy to use..
Love picking and getting more if same genre
Spotify is great. Nice variety of music,
I now dislike this app because it is glitching it will not let me listen to my music cause it says it is not connected so when i tryed to re sign in it says there is a problem it is very frustrating I do not know what Is going on but I do not like it.
Litt
Great music
Best listening available - comprehensive selection; instantaneous variability; uninterrupted music. Fully pleasant.
I had only heard about spotify a few months ago and never looked into it because I just thought it was just like pandora.  I am not a huge fan of having my music selection shuffled with a bunch of other stuff I either already personally own or stuff I don't care about.  Spotify is very refreshing.  If I want to listen to an album that is available I can listen to the whole thing.  I love it.  I can see myself eventually subscribing.
I‚Äôve never seen an app this good for music at all. It‚Äôs absolutely flawless.
It‚Äôs cool
Love this new sound. Just discovered a couple months ago-yay for a new album already!
Such a great thing!
It‚Äôs fun
Great way to expand my musical horizons. Love it.
Randomly crashes and signs me out, making me redownload EVERYTHING. so frustrating!
Playlists for anything
Hey dis Spotify hack is really good because I‚Äôve been doing the tutuapp.vip one and it kept making me delete everything anthem I heard about dis one and it haven‚Äôt Been making me restart all over dis is why you should use dis app to hack Spotify did is why I‚Äôm going to rate 5 stars
There‚Äôs no ads. You get to download a play your music on the go without using data. I love it.
I love it I listen to it everyday thank you guys
First time using it.  Pandora does not work on Island.  Picked soft rock playing awesome music!!
It is awesome
This app use to be great but Spotify just isn‚Äôt what it use to be anymore... look up music you want to hear and then hear everything else except until many songs later ..
When you switch phones your playlists and songs do come with it when you log into your account
Love love love this app so so much!
I can‚Äôt listen to old music that brings memories, and share with people I love.
At first it was confusing to use but then I got to learn and love it!
Good music but there insistence on signing you up is damb annoying
Thank you for the Music
The best app of the streaming services outside the apple ecosystem.
Great
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
BTS has a playlist saved/pinned of all their songs. It plays for me 24/7 I feel like. I don‚Äôt mind the ads. Overall I love it
Thank you for everything
How cool is it that the app is free and I‚Äôm listening to one of my favorite songs while typing this out to you? Another perk is that you get to organize your music and find recommendations for genres of music!
Nice music app
It just keeps repeatedly crashing... It won‚Äôt even let me in. 
This app is amazing i think its one of the many i use
This is a great music app I listen anytime I get!!!!!!!!!
It‚Äôs sometimes hard to find the songs I‚Äôm looking for but other wise great. I can listen to music without paying money. ü§™
So far found plenty of favorite music
It awesome
Spotify still #1 Thanks for the service.
Lovin the Radio Mix‚Äôs
Well... im from romania but somehow i tricked apple and now i can listen to spotify
Great app love it
Easy to use app. To search artists, albums, genres, and build your own playlists. Family share plan is my favorite feature.
I love Spotify
Best music app out.
Spotify premium is the best music downloading app
I love it
Solid app
Nice one!
If you don‚Äôt have premium it kinda stinks but otherwise it‚Äôs nice!!
Loving it
The app is very easy to use and you can find all kinds of music.
Dope
Very good
Amazing.
Love this app
What a joy this is.  It‚Äôs so easy to use, even for a 61 year old! Any song, or artist just put it in and search, and Boom....there all there music is!  I just bought a new boom box and now I‚Äôm wondering why?  Don‚Äôt miss this wonderful opportunity to listen to your favorites!  Debbie/Fort Wayne, Indiana. 
Amazing album‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è
much much much better than Apple Music :3
Best app ever!
Use it all the time.
Good app
I never wanna live without Spotify.
No apple watch app.
Spotify is the best, and as far as I'm concerned, trumps every other music streaming service out there. Especially Apple Music. One request: make a Spotify app for Apple Watch, as that would make working out more enjoyable because I wouldn't need to carry around my phone in my pocket.
‚ù§Ô∏èlove it !
I used to listen Google music or Apple but there‚Äôs only one winner: Spotify.
Never seen spoken word on a music subscription app!
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Great app
Great options love the quality  of sons and the diversity/////love it... alll the kids like having their own account and being able to download while traveling
The best app for my music
I love spotify!!!!
The app is amazing get every song ever I just wish y‚Äôall would make a alarm clock feature
Love it
This is what I was looking for, I don‚Äôt have to use my phone memory
Es gucci
Whenever I shuffle my library it doesn't cycle through all my songs, it sticks to one letter. For example if I hit shuffle it only plays songs that start with 'A' and 'B' and leaves out the rest of my library
Very easy to use. Can cancel if you want too. Your choice to utilize the plan that‚Äôs best for you and how long u want to be in it. Access to  the music you want or need.  Iisten all you want with songs you download to your Ipod. Listen on your iPhone , iPad or computer. 
This is #1 highly recommend it
Good
Omg I highly recommend it. Too much ads being played though but Premium is at a perfect price to get rid of that. I mean $4.99 a month! Like wow!
Much better than Apple Music!
I gave it a four bcs I think it should let us have just a few more skips for free trial. Or do like Pandora and watch an ad to receive three skips.
I love it
Die hard Spotify fan. I‚Äôm very eclectic, and they have all the flavors.
I like this more than pandora it gets more of the music I like but I wish you could select the song you want to listen to
Spotify is Music
I‚Äôve always used Spotify for my music and I love it, but lately the shuffle feature hasn‚Äôt really been shuffling my 3,000+ song library.  It will play the same 30-40 songs and stick to about 4 or 5 different artists.  It‚Äôs quite frustrating because I prefer to shuffle all of my songs most of the time.  Please fix this!
Best workout stations!
Great
Would include 5 stars but wasn‚Äôt told that I needed to assemble Spotify to use it. I still like using it for washing dishes and painting the cat. Changing tires on the car is a breeze with Spotify. 4 stars and 2 slices of üçïüçï
Music is Music and I love Music so Musica is Music! Music Music Music :3
I love deh appe
ü§ô
Works really well
I love Spotify and I use it all the time! I recommend everyone reading this review downloads it. I am also soon going to buy premium.
Amazing place to listen to music u would recommend it to any one.
It‚Äôs perfect.
I have premium and I love it.
I love the wide music selection but I hate that I can't pick my own songs, how much money are you losing by letting me pick my own songs.
I love heavy metal and I found some bands I thought I would never find but I found them thx 2 u and you‚Äôre app goodbye m8‚Äôs
This is a really good app for the ones who love music
Enjoy it a lot. Very good selection of songs.
Bar none the best 9.99 a month your ever going to spend. If you love music this is a no brainer.
Is good because can hear officials songs and other things but Is bad need premium forma listen a song un your playlist and when don't have premium don't can hear nothing when you count Is free
Spotify makes my day shine on!
First time user as of about an hour ago. Enjoying it far more than Apple Music. There‚Äôs an ‚ÄúExtreme‚Äù quality button?!? How cool is that? Quite a bit of music I couldn‚Äôt find before. Also enjoying the radio feature. :)
Awesome!!!

The beat app for music! Way better than Apple Music by far
Check out weekly recommended! One feature I absolutely love!
I like I just don‚Äôt want to pay......
Love it. My daughter set it up for me and now I just sit back and enjoy.
Can I jus get an extra 3 weeks I need this for school when I walk to and home this is an excellent App
I love this app so much! I can listen to artists I like and form playlists! However there are a few issues. One, I don‚Äôt like how they took out the ability to listen to individual songs on free mode. It‚Äôs almost worth buying premium just for that feature. Two, I don‚Äôt mind the ads so much as I don‚Äôt like that there are only 6 skips per hour. I understand that Spotify can only offer a certain amount on free mode but I wish it were a bit more than 6.   Three, I find the suggested tracks a bit annoying. I‚Äôll be listening to my,while not exactly kid friendly but still clean, playlist and a suggested track with some foul language will come on and my mother will get angry with me. I wish there were a way to turn off suggestions. If you‚Äôve made it this far, I thank you for reading my long review
I like how it is but their is a lot of ads
This app is way better than any music app I have ever used. Its better than Pandora! I recommend everyone get this app now!! üòÅüòÄüëçüëç
Great
^
Being able to download songs is really great for when I'm in school or traveling, and the quality is great. I love this app!!!üòÅ
Good musica
This is the best music sharing app
Sometimes albums just disappear and certain artists won‚Äôt have certain albums or certain artists just aren‚Äôt on Spotify. Also it seems you have to be attentive to the radio with the thumbs up or thumbs down or  you‚Äôll hear the same artists over and over
Truly the best. I love it
Cause I get to choose any song I can listen to everyday. This app is wonderful. My family uses this app a lot to listen to music while on a road trip to somewhere. I am glad I found this app. Thank you Spotify for making me happy again.
Never hear of this until I was playing with my iPad and man it‚Äôs unbelievable.
Everyone and Every Band from here to there and  everywhere . My variety is covered with Spotify !!!
Turnip
Recommend an account
This is a awesome the music is so smooth and they have a wide selection of songs
Great It‚Äôs the best I‚Äôm writing a review 
Awesome app...
I can listen to all of my favorite songs for free! Only a little bit of ads
It‚Äôs awesome
Spotify is still the unquestionable king of music streaming services. They just desperately need to make an Apple Watch app.
I don‚Äôt know why but I always preferred Spotify more than iTunes. Maybe it‚Äôs the colors üòçüòÉüòúüëçüèΩ
Love it! Thanks!!
Like the Netflix of music 11/10
Good
I really enjoy the music!! And love the fact that there‚Äôs hardly any commercials!!!üß°
Amazingggg
It rocks!
I honestly wouldn‚Äôt generally write a review but Spotify is quality. I would choose Spotify over Apple Music any day. They are equal on almost everything but Spotify is so much better on recommending music that relates to your taste. For example, I just hopped on Spotify for the first time in a couple days and the first thing that came up was a recommendation to listen to the new ‚ÄòBlack Panther‚Äô album. Worth the $4.99 as a student any day.
Spotify has the most amount of music and it is so easy to use. It‚Äôs also so much more cheap than Apple Music.
Grate
spotify is good and it has alot of songs you can use it on any device ( i think because i am using ipad). I downloaded spotify when i actually wanted to download joox but then i realised that joox wasnt for ipad then i found spotify and it was available for ipad
Mostly music selection, and feels like using it can be more user intuitive
Best Music App
More Colors
Spotify is sexy
Alex es lo mejor
my only complaint is that i share my account with my sister and we can‚Äôt both listen to music at the same time and then it becomes a war of turning each others music off. apple music is awful compared to you guys. thank you for supplying me with playlists and endless music ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I can not find songs that I love.. Example.. Anita baker's song serious I love this song why don't you have it.. I believe that you should update your song lists with your artist I know some left but we can live without them.. Thank you
Has a lot of different genres and varieties of music and still not overly greedy about money like Pandora :)) rlly good app, i should have been using it earlier!!!!!!
I love it and the student discount is perfect
I can't believe how dependent on this app I have become. Honestly don't know what my life would look like without Spotify. I definitely would recommend getting Spotify premium for the full experience of this app. Either way, I love it!!
I love this so much it‚Äôs way better than pandora and you can listen to it on replay
Just upgraded to the premium service and do not regret it. Easy to use and all the songs I like are in here
I‚Äôve used it with premium and it‚Äôs always been great and knows what I like, But lately it‚Äôs been playing dumb. Every time I go to my discover weekly, It shows just plain AWFUL songs. (At least in my opinion) And I‚Äôm just confused. When I‚Äôm listening to rock, After the playlist is done it automatically goes to things like country. But it doesn‚Äôt happen when I play off my computer. Can you fix that?
Me encantooo
Best App EVER!!
Tremendous library and choices of music, news and many other programs
I love the app
Muy muy buena el app
Took break from site but missed my playlists SO MUCH that I re-upped at annual fee instead of monthly. With download feature I‚Äôm good to go anywhere my phone catches a signal. Spotify comes in strong to soothe the soul. TY Spotify!
I love all the artists here and they even have Madonna material girl !!!!
Honestly, amazing choices are all on here. I recommend to anyone who wants to listen to music
Some years back I needed to cancel my subscription. I did, So I thought. Then the next month in that year which was March, they billed me again. I was SO MAD!!!! I couldn‚Äôt get any help canceling my subscription. I had to figure it out all by myself!!!! This is not good business practice!!! This is one of the Big reasons I never turned turned back on a paid subscription!!!!! There Is No customer service to help us. I am no happy with that.
Outstanding platform! Ilove it!
Fantastic app
nice app huge selection moods
This is the best app to hear music !!üëçüèΩ
Love it. Find more music and bands than any of their competitors.  Thank you Spotify!
Even if you don‚Äôt have premium you can still listen to the music you like. Also Spotify try‚Äôs to play songs you might like so it‚Äôs a win win. I highly recommend Spotify
It‚Äôs really good there is no adds
I've tried amazon apple and Google music. This is the best so far.   I would give 5 stars if I could upload music not available in the library. I wish there was a 4.8 star option because even without this, I find the service to be superior. 
Awesome app
Great
D best
It‚Äôs amazing I love the app. I get to listen to music without buying it. But you need to buy premium to skip ads and songs...
I‚Äôd love to give this app a higher score, but I simply can‚Äôt stand the fact that when I‚Äôm listening to my playlist it will put on a song that‚Äôs not on the playlist. I didn‚Äôt put that song on for a reason I want to listen to my music, not what you recommend. üëç
I really like all your songs keep it up
Awesome app
Surely Spotify is a great music app. That's about it that I can clearly say for now.
Better than Apple Music.
Easier to navigate and still top notch
I love this app. If you are a music lover it is a must have.
I love Spotify
I love this app so much I use it every day during my workout and while I‚Äôm just hanging out. The music is awesome. But I hate how when you don‚Äôt have the premium you don‚Äôt have as many skips or you can‚Äôt use it offline.
AWESOMESAUCE!!
I have one request, can you please work with the audio of music while your on the phone like have one go to each ear or something or an option for that atleast would be edited to a 5* and could be an idea you coin so people come to Spotify instead of pandora.
Gets the job done and has pretty good mixes for each station
The family account is amazing and to the point that u have radio  albums even playlist it‚Äôs amazing!!!
I have been using Spotify for years and have no real complaints. Every app has minor bugs between it and the phone but over one of the best music apps I‚Äôve ever used. Highly recommend. I have a family plan with a few other people.
Offers all songs. Excellent app. One of my favorites
Great Music streaming service, even the free version with ads is great. Great playlist.
It‚Äôs better than Apples music app
Wish it was free :-/
Add Acid Rap and I'll give you the extra star.
Amazing get it u should
Its purdy cool
I think it's great but it would be better if you don't have to buy premium  and still listen to your favorite songs
Woohoo
Love it the Is it the music
Any song I want any time anywhere!
Sprint offered a free trial of spotify premium, and it replaced my satellite radio subscription. Skip Pandora, and go Premium with spotify.
pam and ken has this at their pool party and recommended it. i really like it. thanks pam and ken!
Its is the best music app ever!
I love this app. I especially appreciate the ability to create shared playlists with my daughters, siblings, parents, and friends.
Spotify is my favorite music streaming app!
Though the subscription is a bit pricey, it is truly a pleasure being able to download music and skip when you please. 100% worth it!
I can play anywhere i can exept u have to pay for it
Perfect
Great!!!!!!!!
Amazing mixes! Love it!
Best for music bet
Five stars
I love premium I can listen to whatever I want whenever :))
I was using another Ap.  Thought I was ok with it till they started messing with my free lists so I would be forced to buy into there plan.  Wrong!! Hate that!  Family members had  Spotify and loved it. Now I do too!  So much more to offer free but so impressed probably going to purchase monthly plan.
Love the content
It‚Äôs really good
First ever trail you don‚Äôt have to put credit card info in
I love it when I want to play music in the back round and when I‚Äôm not connected to WiFi
Love Spotify!!!
Spotify premium is great!
Never lets me down.
It‚Äôs great so far:)
wish premium didn‚Äôt have a cost but that‚Äôs okay
Very good. Only wish you could pick the exact song to listen to. Need more free skips
Spotify is life
It‚Äôs very awesome
Nice music app
We paid for the upgrade and now Spotify has become an essential subscription, just like our phones and Hulu! Love it
Good
The mainstream ones are there. And a lot of boring ones. All the fun niche stuff in other ecosystems isn‚Äôt found :(
i miss the, hold down a song title and hear a little of it. it helped me find tracks in albums i‚Äôm not familiar with. bRING IT BAAAAAACK please
Doing the free days to determine, if I will be switching from pandora to Spotify...so far so good.
Awesomely
It‚Äôs great for exercise
BEST MUSIC APP EVER
THIS APP IS AWESOME I LOVE IT I CAN LISTEN TO ANYHING I WANT
<3
favorite app to listen to music on!
Such a good app I love
I find new artists here all the time.
The best.
Spotify is definitely my fav music app and I recommend it
Hooray fabulous app
Always has the albums I need
I love this app, I can find all my favorite music.
It's good for 2 songs then starts to play songs not even associated with what I was listening to very frustrating when you only get a few skips!
This is a ok app, hate suggested songs out of nowhere when my playlist has 18 songs already
Perfect app
Been using Spotify for over a year and never have I regretted it. I used the 3 month trial of Apple Music and it doesn‚Äôt even compete. Spotify also takes use of Apple‚Äôs 3D Touch feature in a different more appreciated approach. Spotify you may continue to take my money lol.
Cool app
It has all my favorite songs and if you watch an ad it will give you 30min of add free music take that pandora üòè
I love this app
Wow the best music application ever, much better than pandora
Need to meek it where Baird does not have to be premium to listen to off-line music or Wi-Fi
Excellent
love it!!!! i would be better if the had unlimited skips.
Just the best. Listening all day errday!
Amazing App!!
Absolutely worth the monthly subscription. I use it to motivate my work life, my workouts, and my household chores with endless playlist and radio possibilities.
Spotify premium is so worth it
You shouldn't need to read this. Essential service.
I‚Äôll never use pandora again!
Thank you Spotify üëç
Love how it plays the songs I want to hear
Lovely. Easy to use. The radio station playlists are so enjoyable. A pleasure and very diverse.
Love the mixes and ease of use
Very goodüëçüèΩ
Gucci gucci
Would recommend Spotify to anybody! Great playlists, fantastic app design and performance. It‚Äôs so easy to take for granted how seamless and polished the Spotify app and experience is. The only downfall is Apple music is just far more compatible on it‚Äôs devices it‚Äôs hard to turn away from the integration that Spotify unfortunately doesn‚Äôt have access too since iOS is restrictive on apps abilities.
It‚Äôs the best !!!! You guys are the best
Happy user.
O melhor de todos! A √∫nica coisa que eu colocaria era as LYRICS pra cantar junto com a m√∫sica!
I hate it. I‚Äôm one of the people that doesn‚Äôt want to spend money on apps so I can‚Äôt actually play my music. It just plays random songs and won‚Äôt let me play my own playlists. I don‚Äôt recommend this to anyone that doesn‚Äôt want to spend money
+++111AAA
Good for all of your streaming needs.
Best music app on the market!!!
Glad Spotify is recognizing song writers and producers. Right thing to do. Artists would be just voices without them.
I love Spotify
Best app!
I have never enjoyed listening to music using my phone until SPOTIFY!
Happy with this app
Tbh it is less expensive then apple and better
sooo many ads! stop it! i would rather buy music than listen to 4 adds in a row. we get it ‚Äúyou need spotify premium‚Äù i don‚Äôt really care! i‚Äôm not buying it for $10 a month! netflix is cheaper than that! chill on the ads!
Great music and sound quality. Highly recommend it.
Love it
Thank you so much for this beautiful, multitasking music app! üòçüòçüé∂üéß.   Also, I appreciate the diversity of genres and artists represented in the black history month section and hope to see this sort of diversity continue beyond February! 
Just a great app. Free music at a price, bust still completely worth it
I‚Äôm new and just starting to use smartly but I thoroughly enjoy it.
Spotify gets me through my day!
I was using Spotify like I do 42069x a day and up popped the icon asking if I‚Äôd rate Spotify. Like any good app user I tried to hit decline but unfortunately I hit the ‚Äòrate now‚Äô button. So here we are- Spotify is good.
I‚Äôve been paying for premium subscription for months and it‚Äôs not wrkn at all
Pretty cool, music like it, is the best
Love it
Very impress been having it for two years and haven‚Äôt gave me any problems
I love Spotify!!!!
New update crashes when you: Edit playlist while playing a song, it also crashes if you add a song while playing.  Not good. 
I love that I can find all the music I like! :)
Spotify is an amazing app, easy and convenient to use. It is also user friendly. I recommend it to anyone who wants the best music experience.
Best app to listen to music!!!
Great!!!
better user experience and its the same price as apple :)
I currently have no problems with Spotify it is an amazing app to listen to music. And I made a playlist already with a bunch of songs!
Amazing app
Keep it up
It‚Äôs the best simple and easy
Love this app
I love spotify play list
Premium is worth it. The playlists are so easy to use and compile your favorites.
Great thank you
Spotify is such an amazing music experience where you can listen to music and download songs for free! Thanks Spotify for making me happy every day! üòò
THE BEST MUISC APP EVER EVERYONE SHOULD TRY IT AND YOU WILL LOVE IT
AMAZING
Excelente
Always heard about people talk about how awesome spotify was,  finally just made an account and have been listening with Ads and they really aren‚Äôt that intrusive and I‚Äôve really enjoyed it.
Best!!
No question, easiest and most comprehensive mobile music platform available today
I recently deleted a few songs from one of my playlists but for some reason it keeps playing them like I never deleted them??? Other then that it‚Äôs a great app!
Love Spotify
Spotify is amazing because you can enjoy music where ever you go because you can buy a monthly,and a yearly subscription.
Thank you for this amazing program that allows me to relax to some of my favorite sounds! You guys rock -itspro
ERRATTstr
Ye
You need parental controls. I am 13 and I can not use Spotify any more because it does not have clean music. Please, please! I am tired of using Apple Music! And I do not like it! 
Great app, great collection.
Very nice app
What did we even do before this...üôåüèª
Like
I can‚Äôt get enough of Spotify! All the features and abilities I have to personalize my playlists and download for use when there is no WiFi available makes this app a keeper!
I made my account and it crashed now I can‚Äôt enter it
Hi Spotify! Would it be possible if you can utilize the 3D Touch feature of most phones that support 3D Touch. Would be useful for instant previews of certain albums or songs. Thanks! üòâ
Love my Spotify!!!
Note: I not used Apple Music
The best in music
YES JUST YES PLEASE DOWNLOAD THIS YOUR LIFE WILL CHANGE IF YOU CANT TELL IM LISTENING TO SOMETHING RIGHT NOW SK IF YOU WANT THIS DOWNLOAD NOW 
The best ever I love it
This app is üî•üî•
I use Spotify for hours and hours daily!!!!
Better than pandora
Excelente
Bing back song preview feature.
I love this it‚Äôs a great way to listen to music
Thumbs up
One word FANTASTIC
I‚Äôve been using Apple Music for years and I have no idea why lol Spotify is so much better for music lovers
wow
So I've had Spotify for a couple of years now, but now I can't listen to my songs now. I used to be able to skip all of he songs I want and be able to pick any song I want. Now it's like only premium users can skip and choose songs. Please fix this issue because I got Spotify to choose any song I want to listen to.
The new experimental UI being used on popular playlists like ‚ÄúDance Pop‚Äù is not only ABHORRENT, it takes away essential functions such as editing the QUEUE (yes some people actually use that feature and don‚Äôt want to lose it).
What I want, when I want it!
Thanks for making music great again!
Best music app I‚Äôve had in a long time. Whether premium or not, get all the music you want.
For the last few weeks, my daily mix 1 always throws an error. AND I can't find any place in the app or support site to file a bug or feedback. Help is anybody reading this? ü§ï
This is a great app and I especially like the download function because at my school they purposely sabotaged the wifi and LTE so I can still listen to music.
The best app ever!!!
LOVIN IT!
I‚Äôve been using Spotify for years and it‚Äôs hands down the best music app available. Premium is 100% worth the money. Between having the capability to create your own playlists with the hundreds of thousands of songs accessible by all of your favorite artists and being able to download them for non-streaming enjoyment makes this app a staple. Not to mention the new artists and music genres Spotify provides for exciting discoveries everyday.
Awesome app. I didn‚Äôt upgrade to premium but still better than radio.
Es genial üòçüî•
I get to explore genres of music that I would never have checked out except for the usefulness and extensive music library with this app
There‚Äôs a bug in the latest version that prevents from adding songs to any of your playlists, nothing happens when you tap on the playlist name.
Great
It‚Äôs great.
I like
Me encanta Robarte el Coraz√≥n del Artista Johny Surhtt
Good!
Not expncive at all
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Me encanta esta aplicaci√≥n
Incredible if you have the membership
When I first got Spotify my life changed!  With Spotify premium you can download songs in one second and listen to them anywhere.  I make playlists for party and just for me!  They have all of your songs a variety of pop rock heaven metal..etc!
It plays music
My go to music app.
Excellent music
I‚Äôve had Spotify for years. Great music selection. Streaming works everywhere.
Almost everting there... great interface. Link vi BT or AirPlay no prob.
I love Spotify I have not found a music app that can top Spotify
Great App Best music collection, Even the free version. 
Good great
Love it
My favorite app period!!!!
These latest versions have been causing the app to have some delays. It takes like 5 secs before the app responses when opening it up or going back to it after doing something else. At the moment, this app is crap.
<3
It‚Äôs worth it, and my life is better because of it, so cop this app for all the little kids in Africa who can‚Äôt.
Awesome
I couldn‚Äôt possibly love Spotify more than I do. I use it every single day without fail, and it‚Äôs incredible every single time! And for just $5 with Hulu, it‚Äôs perfect for all of my needs. Thanks so much for making an incredible streaming service!
Best way to party without a DJü•Çü•Ç
Very very gooooood‚ù§Ô∏è
The Scandinavian geniuses show an uncanny commitment to getting license so we can listen again and again to everything out there. I recommend that they have a thing like music match so you can see the lyrics on their platform from their own coders coders. Seriously for $10 a month it's basically free. Figure you listen to music every day that's $.30 a day for having access to millions literally millions of all the music you'll ever. Just get it
i love this app and have been using it for years now, but the thing that‚Äôs keeping it from 5 stars is the fact that you took away previews of songs. i liked being able to listen to previews before adding a song to my queue or playlist
Need more skips
Usually just listen to music on radio stations in the car but since I downloaded Spotify I can‚Äôt get enough of music. So many genres. Love it
Love it!
This app is so good
With the exclusion of some major stars of classic rock, Spotify has the most comprehensive collection of music out there. Even if you don't have premium, you can still enjoy 30min commercial free if you watch some videos in between.
Great start. Can‚Äôt download individual songs without adding to a playlist where the entire playlist is set to download. Can‚Äôt remove an individual song from a playlist.   NO IN APP LYRICS! ‚ÄúInside the Lyrics‚Äù doesn‚Äôt count. 
Itsss littttt üî•üî•üî•üî•
K
Spotify really does a great job suggesting new songs based on what I am listening.
I love how you don‚Äôt have to even buy any of the songs!!
Love Spotify
This app is honestly great. The layout of the app is nice and it‚Äôs easy to get the hang of if you‚Äôre new. I‚Äôve always had premium though, so you may want to hear about others who have the regular because I know there‚Äôs adds and stuff which I cannot stand.
It‚Äôs great
A lot better than weak sauce Pandora!! Had Spotify since ‚Äò12 and cant imagine going with anything else (:
Been a Premium member for a few months now and I love it. The app is well designed and easy to use, and has great playlists too. Many of the artists you know and love can be found on the app, with music selections/playlists updated frequently.
Thank you Spotify. I was paying 22$ for 2 children and did not know you had a family plan. But thank for having it.
So many
excellent
Awesome music application!
I used Apple Music and I have used Spotify and I always end up coming back to Spotify. The daily playlists, discover weekly, and slick UI make this a pleasure to use and just sit back and listen to. It‚Äôs difficult to argue what app does Music better but for what this offers, it‚Äôs just nice to sit around and enjoy my playlists
This app is great by its self but with the premium it‚Äôs amazing
This is the perfect app to play my music. Very minimal adds!
It‚Äôs amazing
Great way to listen to your favorite music when and where you want!
So good
Nice
DPG SW SATX
For a free streaming service it‚Äôs impressive. I like it
soo much better than apple music gonna use it to dj
Yeeeeepppp
Just lots of music... great social aspect with sharing playlists and good random selection based on played songs.
Bbsvb
(Finger guns)
I don‚Äôt listen to anything but Spotify!
where am i?
I am so happy I can hear music while staying In Thailand!
Great app. Better than Apple Music
If you have a specific song you want to listen to but your phone/tablet doesn‚Äôt have it and you don‚Äôt want to spend money get this it is so helpful
No need to ever buy any more music. Spotify has revolutionized this industry and is the future for all music lovers like me.
Solid app! Good selection of music.

This is a amazing app
The beeeesttt
Love it
Such as SiriKit, and have no Apple watch app
Better than Apple Music !
Worth it
This is the best app ever created!!!!! Follow my playlist, Welcome to the best playlistü§òüé∂ü§ò
Great!!!!
Very good
Fast loading and better quality vs YouTube music
I love Spotify I listen to it almost everyday!-I love music!- But the thing is there is too many adds. I know they‚Äôre trying to make you buy premium, but I honestly think they should not add as many ads. It sorta irritates me when I‚Äôm jamming(idk send help) to my music then the ads pop up like .-.
I wish we could just choose the song instead of having to skip through a bunch of them. I do love this app though!!! Great job to whoever came up with this app!!
OMG, LOVE THIS APP!!!!!! THATS LITERALLY ALL I HAVE TO SAY!!! 
I love Spotify!
Cant even select the sing i want i have to shuffle it instead like fix that plz i tried  everything i tap a song AND IT FREAKIN SHUFFLES

Spotify is the best music playing app I‚Äôve ever played.‚ò∫Ô∏è
Awesome
Search for any tune. Anytime. I makes iTunes look so bad. -N- 
I love the fact you can listen to a single artist all day. The download option helps where service is unavailable.üòÑ
I f*cking love Spotify.
I think this is better than a lot of other music apps
Love spotifyüòç
I love it because I enjoy music. It‚Äôs convenient relatively cheap, great quality and more!
F*ck you fix your app. I have 1800 songs that get deleted randomly that i have to redownload
I love this app
I‚Äôve been using Spotify for a very long time now, and I love it! However, it would be so much better if they included an option to open song lyrics on the app itself. It would prevent many alternatives, such as YouTube, or simply having to search for the lyrics yourself on google.
On every other device that I have it doesn‚Äôt make you play random, I have it on kindle fire hd (don‚Äôt remember the gen) the adds freeze my kindle of it plays clicks and static, when there is an add for premium I tap on it and it tells me why I should get it and what it does but it won‚Äôt let me get it
This app its great! Im lovet!
It‚Äôs a really great app love it
I like this app Spotify I listen to lots of different songs and stations that have different artists I really like it and love it I‚Äôll recommend this app to my family and friends
Minty üëåüèª
Awesome!!
Enjoy the flexibility and the endless variety in Spotify.
If that doesn't say it all I don't know what will
Es muy bueno a m√≠ me encanta  es una s√∫per aplicaci√≥n
That‚Äôs it
This is 100 times better than Apple Music/ Beats. One try and you will never try any other music app again. üòÄüëçüèª serious talk!
It works out of app and just great in general
I love the ability to download my favorite songs and the variety of the different playlists for my mood and genre
When you can‚Äôt think of what to listen to Spotify has great mixes for every type of music your into
It just works.  Everywhere.
I love this app it‚Äôs even better than pandora.
I like this bc it‚Äôs is so fun listening to music and this app is for free this app is so incredibly awesome
Great recommendations and selections
Speechless !!  You guys rock !
It‚Äôs gud.
What are you waiting for ?? Best app out there !!
I love the app and it‚Äôs worth paying
It‚Äôs ok
Excelente
Favorite app of all time for me. Really haven't had many problems at all. I will always be a member provided that the good folks at Spotify stay good to me! (:
It good but premeuim should be free for a limited time for new accounts
1. Food 2. Water 3. Shelter 4. Spotify 
Spotify is amazing. Nice and easy to operate. I‚Äôd recommend it to everyone. Search A Tyshaun Wilson for great music too. üëèüèΩüí™üèΩ
I love Spotify, best music streaming app in my opinion!
Why did Spotify Premium become a thing? I wish it never came.. Why can‚Äôt you listen to things Freely?? This needs more work.
I like the option of listening to all of the songs to one artist. Enjoying this music app a lot.
Clean, simple and effective. The playlists that show up on the homepage are an excellent way to discover new music. Plus huge library. Yay spotify
Yes you do
Awesome way to listen to your favorite music, love it!
Really good to listen to your fav music
It is so freaking Awesome but you need to make to where you can have unlimited skips even without premium
I love Spotify. Not much else to say.
Great song selections and ease of use. Love it!
It‚Äôs amazing!!
A DREAM source of Music!
Great
I love everything about SPOTIFY. Clean easy look & usability.
Only thing I wish is a way to have support for the Apple Watch! I love using Spotify for my workouts but if you had an Apple Watch compatible app that would be an amazing game changer.
One of the best streaming apps for music lovers
Love the playlist
This is by far my favorite music app on planet earth and I highly recommend getting this, but I‚Äôve been having a problem. Sometime when I‚Äôm listening to my music, it will randomly pause or skip to the next song without me pressing anything..I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the app or not, but other than that I love Spotify. üòÅ
Better than all other options.  I was using YouTube and iTunes but this blows them away.
Dope
I thought this was gonna be like pandora where u can‚Äôt even listen to the music that you want. Though I have to dock it one star because sometimes it keeps pausing the song.
I LOVE THIS APPüòçüòçüòçüòç it is so good I recommend EVERYONE GETS THIS APP!!!!!
Love the ability to save and create play lists, also alerts on concerts in my area and new releases!!!
Love it
My go to music app
Better then iTunes anyway.
Amazing app!
I hate that it costs money, but I love playing whatever song I want!!
It is great I listen all the time and it has my favorite artists! I recommend it to music lovers!
I‚Äôve been using Spotify more and more, following interesting playlists and I‚Äôm really liking it a lot.
I like the even flow of new music. Whether it R&B hip hop or new euro blends....
Great service
Muy buena
I love Spotify! It plays all of the genres of music I like! I plan on buying the the premium package indefinitely!
Keep up good work Spotify ü§§
Everything I want is there and works great for me.
üñïüèΩpandora
Bangin
Enjoying all muy favorite music from al world. Thank you.üëç
Always the best need not say anything else!!!
This appp is awesome
Every update clearly shows Spotify‚Äôs listening skills when it comes to their community aside from that it is the most convenient music app on the market
Doesn‚Äôt Disappoint
I can listen to a specific artist as much as I want and don't have to worry about the constant interruption of ads!!!!
You can listen to your favorite songs from Spotify and any music
Good music from country to rap
It's straightforward and works well.
Spotify rocks!
I like it a lot better then other ones I‚Äôve used!
New privacy policy gives Spotify access to all your device's data. Now uninstalled and moved to other services!
Spotify is my favriote app to listen to music on its good quality it has a bit of everything and has all of my most favriote artist and it will have your favorites too
Love it
I luv this app completely, the one thing that I luv is that you don‚Äôt got to pay in order to listen to music wherever you go! Which I think is pretty LITüòùü§™ Anyways you do have to pay in order to be like an Premium or V.I.P , I don‚Äôt even know but it‚Äôs pretty üëç
Love it
I like it bcoz its really easy to use and download
ü§¨
This is all I use for music now. It has everything I want.
Spotify is great, unlimited free music and all, but the ads are repetitive and annoying, and the recommended songs that will play in the middle of your playlist can also get annoying, if you don‚Äôt turn that feature off.
üñ§ amazing music app
I been trying to find a app like this
Like that I can keep up to date with music on this, and make custom playlist. The only annoying thing is ads.
Fabulous
Spotify...rocks!!
Super great app! They finally have Taylor Swift on it which makes me so happy! I LOVE SPOTIFY!
This is a excellent app for all type of music. I'm glad that I change to this app.
ü§ôüèª
It‚Äôs ok but it takes you a while to understand it
Absolutely love it
Awesome just awesome m
Good app, still tryna figure out how to download on my üì≤
Great app wish it wasn‚Äôt so expensive to get a membership
I love it. I pay a little each month and I get to listen to whatever, whenever. Definitely a good investment if you love music and don‚Äôt want to pay an arm and a leg.
Love it! The whole family uses it.
Love that it‚Äôs commercial free for 30 mins üòé
I enjoy Spotify immensely!
Every attempt on opening the app it just crashes
Yghfg
It's awesome  Get it.
I always use it so I really can‚Äôt say anything negative about it.
I‚Äôm addicted to creating my own playlists. Sound is clear. Wide diverse variety of music.
Great 30 minute sessions and it free
I love how Spotify stays updated with new music trends and songs it‚Äôs awesome
Excellent
Love all music connecting to Spotify üíôüíúüíØüíúüíØ
Spotify has all the music I loveüòçüòçü§©
This app is awesome. The commercials are surprisingly-informative as well.
It's so great cause I can find songs so easily! And it's free!
This app is amazing no words üôäüòç
Love this app
Wonderful music selection as well as an abundant library for podcasts
Some songs that I would want to find I can‚Äôt find but the quality and the cuantitativo of the music is excellent
Needs Explicit Fight Night Migos
The best period!!!!
Couldn‚Äôt ask for more.
Good stuff
I love it üíØüíØüíØ
Spotify is amazing! I use it every day. I thought it only had secular music, but it has Christian music as well. It has everything! I have gotten the chance to rest in the Lord, and to know Him more. He has shown me how much He loves me through these songs! Thank you!
I am so thankful for Spotify. From the daily mixes, to suggestions, radio options, downloading songs to play offline, following friends... I use Spotify everyday!
Love spotify.
Hey
We need to be able to follow people
I live the different music that it plays.
It‚Äôs great you can listen to music all day
It‚Äôs not even letting me log in. My phone that I used my Spotify on for years was stolen last night and I‚Äôm trying to redo wood it on my boyfriends phone and it doesn‚Äôt let me. I press login and it can‚Äôt even take me to the login screen.
The wide range of options makes Spotify the most flexible and diverse. The option to play offline or stream is great
Spotify and this Spotify app are one of the best ways to listen to a wide range of music anywhere you want.
If you like music then this app is for you. It has everything you can imagine and it's only $10/month! Much better than buying songs on iTunes!
Spot on Spotify! Worth buying the premium package. Thanks for making the music experience enjoyable. 
It has everything I need
Nuff said.
I can't imagine life without Spotify. I know that sounds crazy, but I can't go back. I love it.
Could be better
I started premium a few months ago, it's worth it!! Not only to be rid of ads, but to play that one song or playlist exactly when and how I want.  Nice to see tour dates and upcoming releases for artist I follow.  Like the radio algorithm (although it seems to favor a smallish group of songs; I've had very different playlists get a lot of overlapping radio choices; maybe it is over-valuing the user profile, my playlists are varied and shouldn't be considered as a whole when determining a radio choice for a single playlist).  Development suggestion: I have dozens of playlists, so when adding a song to a playlist it can be hard to scroll through and find the one I'm looking for. Can you add a search bar into the "add to playlist" screen, so I can find playlists by name? Also, would be nice to be able to organize and sort playlist, maybe with folders or sub-lists. 
At first I was getting frustrated while making a playlist but then it started giving me suggestions and then it got easier.
It‚Äôs a better way for me
One of my favorite apps for music.
As an application, it‚Äôs perfect! Able to Chromecast correctly to my devices to stream music. When traveling, never had an issue when going between dead zones.  The reason for 3 stars is because of unbalanced ads. When I‚Äôm listening to quiet classical/ I need to turn the volume up to accommodate it.  When the ads play, they‚Äôre about 20% louder than the normal music.  I didn‚Äôt realize this and the ads damaged a pair of speakers I had. 
The daily playlists Spotify generates are incredible! All of the super-specific stuff I like is represented, and after trying all of the other services, no other company does that.
Keep it rockin!
Really great app, background videos and lyrics add too quality of content.
My church has a station on here with all the music we play and more and so I don‚Äôt have to go out and spend money on cds and having to google each song to figure out what the name of it is so that I can download it. So this is beyond helpful!! ‚ô•Ô∏è
Amazing
Great app!

Spotify has the best music!!! Best thing ever! 
Awesome
I love the music and all but I wish Spotify had more perks like Spotify premium does... really other than that it‚Äôs great
I keep skipping songs and the app keeps giving em to me. Girl I do not want to listen Katie while I jam to heathers.
Awesome app to listen to God‚Äôs plan! 10: is
It‚Äôs great but I deserve a free trial üò≠üòÇ
Pretty good app.
It keeps crashing and playing music not on my playlist
good
Best music app ever!
Its okay.
Love their stations and how they shuffle play all my favorites ‚ù§Ô∏è
My only complaint is the monthly subscription fee. It's a little steep but love the product so much it's worth every penny!
Hi
I only recently downloaded this app and it is wonderful!!!!!
Awesome!
I‚Äôm of course using the free version, thus listening with some limitations. In toto a fascinating experience. Simply splendid.
I‚Äôm listening in South America right now and was listening in Germany 2 weeks ago ... Best music app for me! 
Simplicity the best
Love it!!
The best
Spotify give the song that I want the albums and song I‚Äôve never heard it‚Äôs better than SoundCloud and IHeartRadio who ever made this is amazing TYSM
The best music app ever
Yeah Spotify is pretty lit
read the title again.
I LOVEEEEE ITT!!!!! I honestly find out about new artists thanks to Spotify haha
Keep it up
Tried the competition and came back to Spotify and upgraded to premium. Use it every day.
Good,good,good
Loving it as a friend shared a playlist and it‚Äôs been great!
Is the best
Great selection!!!
Excelente app
Love streaming my favorite artist in my truck at home etc
Fantastic service!
I pay for the premium and all it does is skip. Has worked great for years other than the past 6 months. I‚Äôll be canceling my membership if not corrected soon. IPhone X  up to date*
Very good, but it is kind of useless without preuimium because you can't click a certain song, you have to shuffle playüéªüé∏üé§üåüüéπ
Eh not the best not the worst
This is great! I get to hear music genres that I like and some of these song I‚Äôve never heard before and they are still good!
Exceedingly better than Pandora!
Content is extensive, navigation is cumbersome. now that I‚Äôve been using it for a few days navigation is much better!
I love having Spotify! It gives me the wind down that I need as well as the pick me up every morning!
Good app :) everything‚Äôs nice & easy to use, one thing that‚Äôd be nice though is if you can add an option to open up the lyrics of the song like if you were to type on the screen & lyrics pop up then tap again to put it back. Just an idea!!
The Emojis in The Emoji Movie made this app look sooooo kewl so I just had to get it and the Emojis said that I must rate it 5 stars before I become a social outcast like That One Boii in da movie! Must Buy This App.
It‚Äôs amazing honestly üòÇ I use it on my way to school, or when I‚Äôm trying to block out everything around me. It bends with what I‚Äôd prefer to listen too. You don‚Äôt even need premium to enjoy it!
It‚Äôs great for listening to the music I don‚Äôt have but love
Nice u can choose your artist and what I want to hear
I‚Äôve been on Spotify for about a year now and I listen to my music on my library with service and it‚Äôs been 2 months since my phone played Spotify with service. Please fix this program ASAP It says it‚Äôs connected but not playing please fix this I‚Äôve been listening music on My Xbox one.
Amazing but me and my dad share an account and we can listen to our music at the same time
The best hands down
i'm trying to create an account for two days and all i get is error !! Stupid app , not worth my time
It works for music and stuff really cool
Love the ease of requests for my Old Rock n Roll music. Have not heard the Staten Island PS 39 Elegance boys song in a while. Attended this school when Vito and his group would sing in halls of this school , these old songs are great, just ask Google. Thanks Google from one of the South Beach boys, The South Beach of Staten Island NY not Florida.  Bobby 
Beautifulll App Ever üòçüòò‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I have no other issues with the app other than Spotify removing the long hold/hover option to preview songs. I had used that feature all the time to preview albums/playlists and discover new artists‚Äô top hits. To me, that gets 2 stars removed and also because the ‚ÄúGenres & Moods‚Äù section needs a HUGE overhaul and redesign.
ÿÆŸàÿ®Ÿá ... Ÿáÿ±⁄ÜŸÜÿØ ŸÉŸá ÿ¢ÿ±ÿ¥ŸäŸàÿ¥ ŸÉŸÖŸá
I‚Äôm hooked.
Fantastic app...not sure what format is the songs are...not bad
Very good
The best!!!
I love it
Follow the long long road to your true love
Recently have come back to using Spotify because of their Xbox One integration. That alone is an awesome feature, and basically has me sold on them for the time being. There are just a few more things which could be added which would be great. I'm sure I'm not the only person who enjoyed landscape orientation cover flow of the original itunes music. Tidal has a landscape player and it is pretty awesome. It would also be nice to see them add functionality with the smart invert of iOS. Where if the user has the device set to smart invert Spotify still stays dark. One thing about Spotify which has always been great is the application design language and the darker theme. There are times when it is night though and I don't wanna have the bright lights but I am still using the music app. I turn smart invert on to make everything needed to be dark dark.
Good!
Hi
Great App
Great music with an easy way to get it.
yep
Muy bueno üí™üèºüí™üèºü§ôüèºüëâüèº‚úåüèº
It‚Äôs a great app but... I wish there were less adds I wish that when I put it in Shawn Mendes playlist for example that it would just play him and not all of a sudden play Liam Payne‚Äôs songs!  But besides that it‚Äôs a great app and would recommendüôÇ 
UX is way better than Apple Music, fight me.
Works
I listen to the app EVERYDAY! You need to fully subscribe to get the full experience! Pick what you wanna hear, when you wanna hear it! Custom playlist! Endless music!
Good
It‚Äôs a super good app even if you don‚Äôt have premium.
Spotify is my atmosphere setter, when I do my writing. The music selections are outstanding and the variety of genres is exceptional.
She go mayja kine tings
It be good to give me a longer trail on premium since I have you a 5/5 just saying
Love the app
Really much better then I though. I just deleted pandora which I used on a regular basis until Now.    Check it out.  :-) 
The best music app you can find on app store... Amazing experience without any buffering or loading
App
Great!
Awsm
Amazing.
Pretty good stuff
La amo es la mejor aplicaci√≥n para descargar m√∫sica
My favorite music app!!!!
The best music don‚Äôt have to pay for every song like SoundCloud or Pandora ur the best keep up the good works boys
It‚Äôs great
I like it, but for premium 10$ a month is too much
Absolutely perfect
Normally when you have a playlist with a certain song it plays, but now it won't even play the song and random songs play...
Great app easy to use on desktop and iPhone
Excellent
Buenas canciones y variadas
Very good I teach Spanish and there‚Äôs songs everywhere very useful
People should be able to change their usernames.
Love this app! Use it daily!!
I used to use Spotify for a long time but since this premium thing Spotify wants to make more money out of. It‚Äôs been really hard for me to the music I want to listen too and you have to shuffle play the songs and I always don‚Äôt get the music I want. But back then it was just click and voila but now it‚Äôs horrible. I just want the old version back.
I had Spotify way back when it needed invitation to register and hadn't come to US yet! It has much better song discovery and play lists than Apple music. Much better.
Awesome
:)
I goooooood
I have Apple Music too, this one has more of a radio variety. I found a lot more music I like.
Not good for driving. They should make a separate app for easy searches and quick mixes for driving. Very difficult to search for groups/artists when driving with you one hand
Great app, no issues at all. Upgraded to premium and love it. Rocking all day long with great quality
Great app!
Love the interface. When I get high it‚Äôs smooth sailing.
Excellent and up-to-date music
Finally something better!
Love it !
This app is one of the best music apps I‚Äôve ever tried out!!! One thing I suggest is to add more jpop or Japanese songs in there.  Thank You! ;) 
It‚Äôs got all your aural pleasures cover
still need to add WCW - WWE The NWO theme song and Booker-T can you dig it the WCW Version. Also add disc one of WWF anthology and macho Man Randy Savage theme song WWE version, self hi-fi diamond Dallas page. And Goldberg WCW version.
Spotify is by far the best music discovery space.. discover weekly is an incredibly intuitive feature that brings me fresh new finds regularly. Also love the ease and user friendly design that allows me to switch from computer to phone. I honestly love this brand and have been a daily user since 2012. Huge advocate for Spotify and can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm just now writing a review. Would love to be a content creator for this company even üôåüèΩ
Spotify is amazing! You can make whatever playlists you want. Plus, you can make your own playlists. There are barely any ads.  When there are, it‚Äôs usually only like 5-10 seconds long, or one so that you can watch a short video so you can listen to ad-free music for 30 minutes It. Is. AMAZING! It doesn‚Äôt cost money, and all you have to do is sign up with an email. It‚Äôs that easy.   I RATE 5 STARS!!!  I LOVE IT!!!!! 
I‚Äôll make a video review and edit
Great
This used to be one of my favorite apps for music but I tried to log in again using Facebook and it won‚Äôt let me anymore. It just pops up saying error 404 or 401. Please fix this
Better than pandora!
Best app ever! Way better than pandora!
Thank you for giving me free music
I really love this app!!!
Honestly I love it so much for it being free and I wish I had premium but I don‚Äôt wanna use my money on it cause I listen to not many music and I just shuffle and the extra skips and etc would be nice but I‚Äôm good
I have enjoyed this App for so many years now.  I love listening to old music that have been part of my maturing years.  Thank you Spotify.
My go-to app for music. Well worth the $10 a month.

This app is all that you can ask for. It has all the songs you can possibly think of. It's worth having premium or not!
FIX YOUR F***ING AUTO REPEAT FOR YOUR APP.  I‚Äôve tried everything and you stupid app keeps turning on repeat after EVERY. F***ING. SONG.  Your customers pay YOU to provide us with a smooth running app.  FIX YOUR CRAP APP OR I‚ÄôM CANCELLING MY PREMIUM AND SWITCHING TO APPLE MUSIC. 
I share the account and it gets annoying when you are listening to music and the other person starts listening to theirs and your music stops
Lol best app ever for music
I love to choose who I want to listen and what type of music most fits me, create playlists for each mood I‚Äôm in. In all I think it‚Äôs just a great app.
Puedes descargar toda la m√∫sica que quieras y escucharla sin internet
Cool to hear music
Oh my, where has this been all my life.
Fake
Awesome selection of multiple genres!
One of the best in the world
Cool
It‚Äôs great to find new music
It‚Äôs good
Easy to maneuver.
Wayyy better than pandora!
Love it, so much better then the regular radio.
Exactaly
Wish you could choose the song you want without having to get Permium.
I don‚Äôt know how I lived without Spotify!
Love Spotify with all its choices!
Better than pandora have more variety of songs
Good
Pretty self explanatory, get dope music at the cost of an ad every once and a while and even that they have special deal ( that are still free) while doing what YouTube dosent and playing in the background. It is honestly spoiling us with the price
My favorite music app.
Just started using it.... I like it so far. üëåüèª
It has all of my favorite artists and music. I told my friends about Spotify and they love the app.
..
it‚Äôs amazing the way it find almost every song you want to listen and every artist it‚Äôs amazing
Very nice quality and I can jam for hours
Omg
It is awesome
Smooth lovely songs between opera and pop!
Well, if you don‚Äôt have premium it is not worth it. You could make a playlist and shuffle play it, then Spotify plays something THAT IS NOT EVEN ON THE PLAYLIST. Serious problem they need to fix, at least other apps don‚Äôt play random stuff.
I really enjoy listening to Spotify. So many different kinds of music. New and old. I do recommend it highly. üòÄ
I love using this app!!!
Spotify is the best music streaming service available, in my opinion. They have a decent catalog. Any songs they don‚Äôt have but that you already own, you can import into the app using the Spotify desktop software.  The mobile app is really only worthwhile if you have a premium membership (unlike Spotify for the desktop and iPad, the mobile app doesn‚Äôt allow free subscribers to choose songs on-demand).  That said, premium is well worth it if you listen to a lot of music on the go. 
An excellent app.. 100% recommend
As a musician and worship leader, having such an extensive library readily available has been a huge help to me and the various teams I play with.
Great selection and UI !
I love it but it isn‚Äôt all free so be careful  And check me out on musically Alexis_v_miller 
:)
Love this!
you need to get this app it always has the new songs and it‚Äôs soo easy to set up a playlist
Everything is great, but they sometimes don‚Äôt have all the songs you need.
üëçüëçgreat
Spotify pro for students is 1/2 off per month. As an opera singer it's very useful having a whole world of music at my fingertips and  listening to country is always a plus!
I love Spotify but if it worked better if WiFi I would like it better

Awesome App
Freaking awesome
Love just love
Perfect
Waayy better than Pandora
All the music apps today cost money to buy the songs. Spotify has so much more than that!!! And, if you want more from your music, it costs money, but Spotify premium is worth it!
Spotify was great because it let‚Äôs me pick a song and play that exact song I picked. It could have a sleep timer and if it does I can‚Äôt seem to find it‚ò∫Ô∏èüíúüëçüèº
Better than apple music
Good app for music and makenyour on list
I just updated this app and really regret it. The downloads tab was my most used feature- as someone who commutes and listens to music offline it conveniently had my saved music sorted by playlists and albums. Now, the process of finding your offline music has become incredibly cumbersome- you have to filter it out in each category and scroll through a long list. I don't understand why they would sabotage their users like this and take away something like the download tab. As someone who's been subscribed to Spotify for three years, this is making me consider dropping it for Apple Music. The developers of this app have no clue what the users want.
Too limited without premium
It‚Äôs lit
Enjoy the sting a lot
Was with Apple Music almost a year but when I got on Spotify it was a wrap. Great Selection and I find music I can‚Äôt find on Apple Music. Making playlist and being recommended music and getting a playlist that matches my taste is amazing and makes me feel special. Kudos to you Spotify.
I love this app so so much it's so awesome!!!!
I cant find one of the song from some Album that Spotify has :(
Terrific music selections comprised of your favorite artists.  I highly recommend the Spotify app to anyone that enjoys music, variety and simplicity!!!
It‚Äôs really good because it plays when the screen is off and when it‚Äôs not in the app
Awesome
Spotify is AWESOME
Si eres un amante de la m√∫sica y te gusta estar al d√≠a con todo lo nuevo y viejo de todos los artistas del mundo. Est√° sopa es ideal para ti!
Spotify is awesome!! I love how much variety it has, in everything I search. And also the quality is great. Trust me, premium is totally worth the money, little cost too!!üéâüéâüéâüíØüíØ
So nice works really well.
Great.
I enjoy  spotifyüëçüëçüëç
I can not login. I uninstalled and re-downloaded and it will not allow me to move past the log in or create account screen.
Decent but very good with premium
Very Cool sounds
I‚Äôm canceling my subscription to this app. Something as simple as making it harder for me to fund my downloads has kind of turned me off from using it. The library of songs is amazing, but if I‚Äôm paying to download music I shouldn‚Äôt have to search through loads of songs that I‚Äôve listened to to find a single album.
Good app
It's great
‚ù§Ô∏è an amazing app!
When I open the app it crashes and goes to my home page
Great customer support, great suggestions matching your taste, easy to find your way in your own hundreds of playlists, their catalogue is growing and improving over time. Of course it's not perfect but it's as good as it can be and keeps improving according to their customers wishes.
Awesome !
Five stars
I chose Spotify over Apple Music for many reasons. Spotify has a sick UI and is has the best music streaming algorithm. One of the small things that can be improved is being able to move playlists in a specific order. When selecting playlists then edit, the user should be able to move those playlists cells up and down to keep playlists organized.
Hi! My name is Lucy! I love Spotify! My dad found out about it (he is obsessed) and said I should get it. I was like, ‚ÄúNo, I have pandora, I‚Äôm fine!‚Äù But he kept telling me to, so I did, and it was great! On Pandora, you pick a station. On Spotify, you can pick the specific songs you want played! It‚Äôs really great. I would recommend this to anyone who likes music.
It‚Äôs a great app killing satellite radio
I love this app and always listen to music when I work out or do other things.
It's so cool
Hey can you please of all songs add I don‚Äôt Understand This by xxxtentacion
Easy setup and easy to use between devices
Great app !  Nice to listen to a variety of songs that remind you of the story of your life ... ‚úåÔ∏è
Good music and great format
If you like music then you need this app.
Great program, gets better with each revision.  The family plan is definitely worth it!  Five year and counting user.
Great
Has all the latest music.
Great tunes
Yes
Had this app for a while now and have enjoyed it! Essential for any music lover. The radio and playlists have improved outright.
Great streaming service but you are essentially bullied into premium. Probably worth it but I keep the free service just to be stubborn.
It‚Äôs dank asf
For iPad this is amazing.
I love it
This is great
It‚Äôs amazing try it for yourself
Obviously it doesn‚Äôt have underground titles but they have almost everyone bigger. I was disappointed with the removal of the some Sloppy Toppy Travis and Migos. Kinda broke my heart
I‚Äôm ok with the commercials but would like other things you get with a monthly subscription. But for free this is very good
What the title says.
Starting yesterday (2/7/18), the Spotify ads are using a swear word. Not necessary and will go back to Pandora if it doesn‚Äôt stop. I certainly can‚Äôt have Spotify on with my kids around now, but really, I don‚Äôt want to hear it either.  Take out the swearing and I‚Äôll go back to 5 stars. 
U can listen 2 any song 4 free and make playlists and so much more
I've turned over to Spotify from pandora. You get more of a personalized selection of music.
Si
The best music app
It was really good to listen to music while I was reading and the music is really good as well when you have nothing to do
a
My grandson introduced my to Spotify. He is very active in theater and loves to listen to show tunes.
Love the music although there are sometimes many ads which gets annoying, also you only have a certain amount of skips unless you buy Spotify premium. Otherwise great app thoughüëç
This is a anywhere anytime type radio. Love being able to get my music
It‚Äôs good
üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº
Yay
best app all around, it‚Äôs really great.
Too quality!!
When I was a little boy, alone and walking the earth and having adventures, I came upon a wisened little man in an empty swimming pool, behind an abandoned two-story house, in the Sonora Dessert. And he spoke these, the most valuable words to me, on the meaning of human life, on this strange, little planet...
I‚Äôll start by saying there are a lot of really useful features and I really love using Spotify but my only big complaint and reason I left Spotify is that I have a lot of personal mp3 files that are not available on Spotify and getting them to sync from your pc to your phone does not work the way it should. I set everything up the way it should and it eventually syncs over after several attempts and like half an hour of screwing with it
amazing
Everytime you lock your phone, the music skips ahead. Everytime you unlock your phone, the music skips back. It will pause and skip songs automatically. The app became extremely glitchy and if the next update doesn't fix this, I will not be using Spotify (Premium) anymore.
Tried several other apps over the years and I always come back to Spotify. Simply the best and easiest to use. One feature I would love to see is a song identification function that will listen to music in the room and direct you to the song in the app.
Spotify is awesome! i wish i had found it before. Enjoy it! 
I love the fact that I have offline playlists.
They have the best quality of music and all the songs you want !!
I like the idea and music of Spotify, but the app design is shockingly bad for such a major platform. Tiny and often cryptic buttons, horrible queue management, and generally bad control of everything has led me to being unable to see and manage my queue, accidentally delete songs from my library, and a host of other frustrating outcomes.  I‚Äôm an interaction designer and usability researcher, and it‚Äôs hard to imagine either of those disciplines being applied to Spotify. If they were, you would have never released the app in this state. It‚Äôs appalling to use, and I‚Äôm seriously thinking of stopping my Spotify subscription because of how much I hate using the app. It‚Äôs in need of a serious redesign based on real user needs and testing. 
Love the app in every way. Incredibly convenient and easy to use. However the biggest annoyance I‚Äôve noticed over the years has to be making playlists. There has been no major changes to Spotify in quite a while which is ok, but I wish they‚Äôd make it easier to create playlists. I think there should be a way to select songs from your library and move them to playlists. That would make it so much easier considering the only way to make a playlist right now is one song at a time or by album. Look forward to seeing Spotify change for the better
Buena variedad de m√∫sica y muy amigable para el usuario
I love Spotify but I don‚Äôt like how you have to pay to listen to all the songs
Love the variety in playlists!
I have tried just about every music app out there. Spotify has the best selection and easy to use. Glad I tried it!
it‚Äôs gr8
awesome
Better selection of today‚Äôs music and the classics!!
Convenient
Nice and smooth
Does very well
Fix the unnecessary stops on the iPhone X when locked. I‚Äôm the only one on my account.
The best
Use this service everyday. Great platform with custom playlists and personalization to music interests.
Love Spotify and how easy it is to discover new music and ones that interest me. One thing I wish was able to do is combine and midge playlists so I can listen to music on both playlists instead of individually adding every song (which may not be a big deal unless there‚Äôs a lot of songs on the playlist). I really enjoy the app and look forward to improvements.
Premium is always worth it, super awesome. Great selections, very diverse.
‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
The only thing that bugs me is paying for premium but I understand why that is
Misic 4ever
It‚Äôs got tons of great music!!! Love the app definitely recommend it to anyone who wants an app that doubles as not an app that allows you to listen to jut about any song you can think of, and an app similar to Pandora, but better!!! Definitely love this  app!
Amazing breadth of music selection, seamless user interface, and great sound quality. Must have app.  As for the Spotify Premium thing, I certainly find it worth it for the offline use and access to individual songs, but the app is still perfectly fine without it. 
Spotify is good even without premium cuz there's always ways to get around stuff and the ads I don't rlly mind it's just there's some songs they don't have the only other thing I use is SoundCloud but yeah u should get Spotify if u listen to music
Maybe
Really good app
In high school I didn‚Äôt have many friends, and the only family I had was a distant stepmother with borderline personality disorder. Some days I had a loving mother some days I had a woman who hated my guts and blamed me for her misery. Through my loneliness and depression I had Spotify. My stepmom didn‚Äôt allow me to have any social media, the only phone I could have was hacked by her. Music was my only expression, I spent hours every day making playlist that were over 200 songs. Spotify saved my life and kept me sane because even though I was alone I could still listen to someone out there painting my picture.  -Thankyou 
I use to have another music app, but love this one üíØ! I just love concert alerts and helps me to decide whether I want to go or not and I usually do!!! Thank you Spotify!!!
Amazing music app
Awesome
I love this app! Not only does it have fewer ads than Pandora but you can also make your own personal playlist.
Just love Spotify! Easy to navigate. Love the weekly discovery they create based off music you seem to like. They offer great mixes. Reliable and brings me joy!
Love it
Love that I can find anything I'm looking for
It‚Äôs the best it has the that I can actually listen too when I can‚Äôt find it on amazon or iTunes
Overall great
its the best thing ever
A todos lados llevo mi m√∫sica favorita Gracias a Spotifyüëåüëä
You get a discounted membership for only 5$ a month to listen to all of the music you want, it‚Äôs Awesome.
A great app to creat a play list to enjoy music at work!
Complete music package for anywhere (at least if you have CarPlay)
Best music app and streaming service. Great features and really caters too you.
I absolutely loved Spotify, listening to all the music I wanted whenever I wanted. But yesterday I figured out that I now can‚Äôt pick out the songs I want unless I shuffle!! This stupid premium is so annoying and now I‚Äôm thinking on deleting the app!!! If you change this by  2/15/18, I‚Äôll Definitely keep the app, but if not and I keep having the same problem, I‚Äôm going to delete it!!
I've had Spotify for close to 2 years and never had an issue. One day out of the blue I was logged out of my account when I tryed to log back in my account was inaccessible. I finally received an email that my google account had been hacked from Spain. I put the pieces together and found out my account had been hacked from Spain. My bank account was charged another payment. I was able to access the hacked account for a brief moment to try and cancel the subscription and all my playlists were gone and replaced with foreign music. All that work and it's gone. Done with Spotify. You've lost a loyal customer. Because you have no customer support besides email. I don't have time for that! Where is a phone number so I can get help NOW?
Esta. Muuuuuy bueno. Esto. Primos. Hermanooooo. üòÇüòÇüò¨üò¨üò¨
I love Spotify so much. I use it everyday. Perfect for anyone and everyone
Great app
It says that i will get 30 minutes of ad-free music but i get ads every 10 minutes and it pisses me off. why you gotta lie to your customers/users. shame
üëçüëçüëçit's awesomeü§òü§òü§òü§ò
Spotify is easy to use and has a wide variety of my favorites. Thank you Spotify I listen daily!!!
The app lets you listen to anything you want but I can‚Äôt find the playlist
Great music app
Great selection for groups I grew up with in the 70s and 80s
Love the Spotify app; great music and can even share with discord.
Best music streaming app out there!
The app is good but the only bad part is that you need premium to have a true music experience.
For some reason the Equalizer is messed up, anywhere beyond like 40% will start clipping lower frequencies if I want more bass. My other phone does not do it, it‚Äôs an android, I think that this equalizer needs to be fine tuned.
Just buy premium don‚Äôt be s broke boi
I commute to college everyday, it‚Äôs about an hour and a half each way. Thanks to the deal on Spotify premium for students, the commutes enjoyable. I‚Äôm also appreciative of how concerts in my area will appear under artists! Spotify is the best!!
Good music and no bugs for me so far!  I like it!!
Just cool
I‚Äôve had Spotify for about 2 years and I absolutely love it! But now whenever I get a ad for 30 minuets of free music, it gives me like 5 ads! I find this annoying but everything else is fine in my opinion.
Hands down still the best music streaming app out there!
LUV THIS APP.  Helps me through the dayüòç
I love all the music. Can you make more?
This app is awesome! Streams absolutely every song.
I love Spotify. But I‚Äôm on a premium plan and I‚Äôm not getting the premium features, so I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the problem.
It‚Äôs just AWSOME. I honestly think it‚Äôs better than Pandora üòçüòä KEE·ë≠ ·ëå·ë≠ T·ïºE GOO·ó™ ·óØO·ñáK ·îï·ë≠OTI·ñ¥Y
I can download my favorite music! And don‚Äôt have to worry about my data running out with the offline mode! The price is real good and reasonableü§üü§ü
So I don't know if Spotify actually reads our suggestions. I love Spotify and I use it all the time. I am a premium member and I enjoy not online and offline features. I can play it on my PS4, computer, phone. If I listen to all songs on my playlist (or artist/album) Spotify finds music similar so that I don't have to be music free.    But I still have Pandora on my phone. Why is this? Because when I am going to bed I like the fact that Pandora has a sleep timer. The timer has the option to set a amount of time that way it will shut off the music after I fall asleep, instead of playing all night long. If Spotify had that feature I would 100% un-download Pandora and just use Spotify. Something to consider for future. I honestly wish Spotify had that feature. I don't like Pandora at all. 
.
Just perfect
Nice
Great at shuffling music!!!
Every time I go to get into Spotify, it takes me in, the screen flickers a few times, then it kicks me back out.. fix this, please.
I love this app so much ü§™üòçüòç
I‚Äôve loved this app even paid for premium, until recently where it would pause with ever and any notification, plus whenever I create a radio station it‚Äôs always the same songs even if I thumbs up or thumbs down, should be a way to actually change that up without repeating songs
Love it
But this is the THIRD time one ONE month that I‚Äôve had to re-download my ENTIRE library. Having over 1600 songs in my library and having to download them again constantly is a major pain. I can‚Äôt stream due to data limits. So I‚Äôm stuck listening to whatever was downloaded while I was connected to WiFi rather than what I want to listen to. Please fix this bug or I‚Äôm cancelling my account and moving to Apple Music.
Greasy
Good music
Spotify is AWESOME!! I love the fact that there's no commercials and also that it plays the song I'm looking for.‚ù§Ô∏èüòä
I'm in love with Spotify - EVEN ON SPOTIFY FREE. Of course we should pay for the amazing range of music they provide us with. Even then we get very few (and short) ads.  Definitely upgrading to premium as soon as I'm a student. Although regular premium price is not half bad considering the wide range of artists provided, shoooooot. I love it. I really do. Thank you Jesus for Spotify. Honestly.  Update: I HAVE PREMIUM NOW AND MY LIFE IS CHANGED FOR THE BETTERRR!! You can also ‚Äúdownload‚Äù songs to allow playback OFFLINE and it‚Äôs the best when you‚Äôre on airplane mode or without service in certain zones. It‚Äôs great. You also get all of the underground artists that Apple Music still has yet to discover and you get unlimited plays and skips and podcasts and ‚Äúradio station‚Äù selections from SONGS you love. My favorite is the station for Massive Attack‚Äôs Be Thankful for What you‚Äôve got. So good. I love Spotify!!! 
The Spotify codes are fun!  Print out a playlist and put it on your wall as decoration to scan and enjoy your faves.  Also the student Hulu discount is clutch.   ü§ôüèæ
Wish to have lyrics.
So many artists and new music to enjoy!
Love it!!
I used Spotify for years, then switched to Apple Music so that I could play music from my Apple TV.  Apple Music has less selection, fewer good playlists, and an awkward interface. As a classical music listener, it really bothered me that Apple Music has forced gaps in between music tracks (which are often meant to be played continuously).  Spotify has none of these defects. I bought a pair of Sonos One speakers, and I‚Äôm glad to be back with Spotify! 
Best music app in the world
I love the option of creating my own play list. The idea of listening to my music based on my mood or my situation is awesome. I am not a conformist and this lets me be me my way
Awesome Music app
J
i love it
If you have internet it's great
Kewl
I love this app I get to listen to a lot of good artist but if I want to play a certain song it won‚Äôt let me it will just play songs similar not the one I want then when I try to skip through them then I‚Äôm out of skips and still on some random song
I love this app, I have premium!  One of the only apps I use everyday 
Great app
I love, love this streaming app, and would recommend getting premium. ... doing this bc Spotify made me.
Please let me listen to when off line... Or at least download a hand full of songs for free to see if preamium is work it
Access to so much music. Great music service. And app is chic in appearance ad functional at the same time.
My favorite app. No complaints .
üëçüèæ
üôÉ I like it.
I loved the app until I couldn‚Äôt just play that one song I loved. I have to get premium to do that. I think that‚Äôs stupid. Because when I get mad I just want to listen to that one song but no I have to wait through my playlist until it comes. By the time it does come I‚Äôm not mad anymore. I also HATE that you run out of skips. That‚Äôs just f-stupid. Please please please fix!!!!!
Please fix the cause of the slow downloads on iPhone X !
Just wish the songs had lyrics along with Genius
Is the best for exercising
Good
Great app if you have premium
Amazing app
Its affordable and It makes it really easy to explore new music.
Only if you have premium everyone should get premium
Now I know how to sleep at night!
ayeyeyehyeyeyeye
Love the app. Lots of music!
I love it... it just has to many ads.
I like the fact that when I choose an artist or group, I can hear their music, not a bunch of other spin-offs or kinda likes!
This app has come far, making a hybrid app that cover Pandoras radio algorithms and SoundCloud instructed Dev. Making radio and demand together, thank you Spotify.
Love this appüíõit has so many things you could choose from ‚ú®üî•üíõ
I love the app, but I went to go play another song and it said skipping was only for premium members, what‚Äôs that about?
Love this app always using it !!! Also is affordable which is the best
Wowüòç
Awesome, all kinds of music, playlists, sharing!
Like it‚Äôs the best to hera music
Glad I made the decision to download
Spotify is love. Spotify is life.
Love it, I pay for premium. Totally worth it. Highly recommend
I used to use then suddenly my account got hacked and I couldn‚Äôt use Spotify since.
Really great app 1 star if you have free,  4 Star if premium hmmm ü§îü§îü§î Needs more options on the radio too 
It would be a 5 if songs didn‚Äôt default to pg versions
My favorite music streaming service!
It gave you 7days of free trial with no paying good Spotify
Good selection of music
My favorite feature is how it auto generates a top 100 playlist for most listened to songs of that year.
Luv this app it is awesome as heck üíúü§™
Good variety of music!!!
Es lo m√°ximo. De verdad no tiene rival.
Absolutely love Spotify! I just wish premium was free.
Very fantastic music and no price
It is a great app you don‚Äôt pay for anything unless you have premium
I‚Äôve used Spotify for five years and I‚Äôve dealt with this premium problem for almost two years until it created a download button. I absolutely loved it! I use to listen to Hamilton the musical track on other apps and I could never get the transition to go smoothly. But when I figured out Spotify transitioned it perfectly, I loved it! But now... the premium thing is back... now I have to wait another couple more years until it becomes better again. Like seriously? No one is going to want to use this app if it‚Äôs gonna have all these problem with premium ads and stuff. I literally cried when I tried to tap the download button and the premium thing popped up. I was so sad. SPOTIFY, YOU BETTER QUIT THIS PREMIUM AD STUFF!üò≠üòûüëø
Glad to be able to find my favorite music in high quality.
M√°s que excelente
AWESOME! DOWNLOAD!
My personal rating is 5 stars! I love this app because it introduces me to music I never heard before.üëåüèºvery good performance. üëåüèº Although I love it, I wish I could search up a song and play only the song instead of a playlist.üòçüòçüëåüèºüëåüèº 
Love this app!
Amazing love it
This is the best for students. That discount too üíñüëåüèºüåù I love that I can download all my music for when I go on trips, or just taking the bus. I don‚Äôt have to waste data. And I can find playlist for any mood or genre. Wish it had a few more indie artist but it still has a great library.
(Just no words to describe it) JUST AMAZING
Waze in the way, music vids bugging out and making it impossible to add songs to my library and wasting my data, and COMMENTARY!?! Spotify's for music!!! If I wanted vids and commentary then I'd go-to YouTube (which I never do anyway)!!
Every now and then when either my iPhone has to restart or runs out of battery, Spotify logs off from my account and simply deletes every single downloaded song I had for offline listening.  It amounts to around 2200+ songs that I have to download all over again everytime it happens.  It needs a permanent fix, urgently. 
it's good
Good
The app is perfect and would be even better and possibly even being more money if they set up an alarm for premium members so they could wake up to their favorite songs in the morning
Greatest song library in the world.
You all are very Lit  - Blake Go Wavy 
It‚Äôs amazing
I love using it
Love this app so much
Love it üíÅüèºüíï
Love it!!
What can i say‚Äîgreat!
Love it
My songs on my saved list keep skipping.
Helpful to me :) thanks
Very enjoyable and quite interesting.  Paranormal is always something to think about.
Every 30 seconds spotify seems to pause during playback on wifi or 4g lte. They only way the intermittent pauses stop is if i change the music quality to extreme. Im on an iphone 8 plus with ios 11.2.5.  Please fix
Check it out...,,
Great music I recommend this app to everyone
plays everything but the music on my playlist
üëçüèΩüíã‚ù§Ô∏è
Along with many more people I own premium & I am not happy, because of the storage situation... I have 4 very small playlists ( 5 songs. 14 songs. 20 songs & 30 songs) and none of them are downloaded. And it takes up 8 gigabytes!! And it obviously shouldn't. I hope y'all fix this soon.
Love this app so much .
Love it! My 2nd day & I'm totally addicted.  Way better than other services.  May go premium at some point but right now I‚Äôm getting so much more than I bargained for, I don't see the need for it yet.
WAY better than the others!
Thank you mostly gospel music love being able to pick and choose üëèüèæüëèüèæüëèüèæ
Obviously my best music app
Would recommend
Many music app had restrictions on playing music but Spotify.
Honestly Spotify is such a great app if let‚Äôs you hear songs that sometimes aren‚Äôt even that popular and it also lets you hear songs that fit with your taste of music. Great app!
I'm freaked
Huge Catalog if music for all. We have 3 different profiles, the family plan. It works very well.
I‚Äôm honestly very disappointed I used to love Spotify but now they play songs that I don‚Äôt put on my playlist and it‚Äôs really annoying pleas fix this if it doesn‚Äôt get fixed or something doesn‚Äôt change I‚Äôm deleting all I want to do is listen to music!!!
3 stars because I used it once and it was pretty good. Like I said, ONCE.  Now whenever I try to open the app it shows the logo, and after a few seconds it just crashes. 
So simple, so awesome!  No more buying singles. For lovers of different music. This is it 
I use this app all the the me and it is simply amazing and useful
:)
Amazing! My fav is free 20 day premium üòé
Love Spotify!! Always has great playlists to fit all of my moods ‚ù§Ô∏èü§ì
This is honestly the best music app I‚Äôve tried. I‚Äôve payed for SoundCloud membership, Apple Music and even tidal. But Spotify wins on all sides. Music selection is great. Shuffling and personal playlists are very neat and well done. And last but not least the custom curated playlists that Spotify makes for you. All around definitely deserves the 5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
I love this app, it has all the music I listen to. But..there‚Äôs a little problem, you took away the preview feature! That was my favorite feature of all features! Why? So I don‚Äôt have to listen to the whole song and just be able to listen to a particular part, sometimes it even could be the best part of the song!  In conclusion, please bring that feature back.. it was one of the best features in my opinion. Hope you read this! 
Meets my expectations!
Best music app!

It‚Äôs just so good
I love this app but it is very disappointing that the app is not offered on Apple Watch
So amazing and it‚Äôs free!!!
My husband had been using free Spotify at work, meanwhile we had an Apple Music subscription that we used on our iPhones. Apple Music playlists seemed to be getting stale and I received a 2 mo free trial from Spotify so figured, why not. I was afraid I‚Äôd miss my old playlists but so far I haven‚Äôt even looked back. Initial thoughts‚ÄîPROS: Spotify‚Äôs playlist are better and I like the look of app better too. CONS: I don‚Äôt like that when signed in to one account you can not listen to different songs on different devices at the same time.
I don‚Äôt even know that there are such a good app like this in my store.
I used to love it but now it‚Äôs just annoying. If I wanted Pandora, I would‚Äôve downloaded Pandora. If I make a playlist, it means I wanna listen to my fricken playlist, not a playlist similar to it. Sometimes I‚Äôll hit shuffle and I won‚Äôt even get ONE song that‚Äôs on my playlist. That‚Äôs INCREDIBLY frustrating.
Provides lots of free music to shuffle through. Great at what it wants to be.
AMAZING
The best singer ever üé•üé•
Can‚Äôt live without it!
Lot of thought put into ithis app! It has a lot of bells and whistles.
It doesn't let you choose your songs after some time. The premium for Spotify ad always pops up but it costs money. Other than this I love ‚ù§Ô∏è Spotify.
Nice app
Always with the latest music. Couple mixtapes missing but still a solid app. 
This app is great for listening to music that you can skip if you‚Äôd like or request to listen to. You can also create your own playlists for free with which ever music you like. I recommend it to anyone.
I have premium and have never had a problem with the app!! The free version is great too but premium is well worth it, you learn so much about the artists and get ‚Äúbehind the lyrics‚Äù and even get to see what music is trending in what country! It‚Äôs amazing for all the music nerds out there.
‚ù§Ô∏è enough said
Best music app ever
Honestly don‚Äôt get me started on this app. When I don‚Äôt want to listen to a song but I ran out of skips it‚Äôs says to upgrade to premium. So I try to upgrade to premium. But to this day I have not even seen a option to upgrade to PREMIUM
..but no complaints. My most used app, word!
üòçüòçüòò
It really is :p
I thought premium just meant you skip the commercials but apparently it means of you don‚Äôt have it you can‚Äôt listen to anything you want at all.... deleting this app. No thanks!!!
I had avoided checking out Spotify I until  I heard about a free version. It‚Äôs fabulous! Si much variety and the commercials aren‚Äôt half bad, even entertaining at times. Def worth it.
I love it so much. Before I had Spotify I‚Äôm trying to get Apple Music but it wouldn‚Äôt work until I came across Spotify I love Spotify so much it is so cool I got to turn my phone off just like Apple Music except is better than Apple Music
Good app
I have used Spotify for a few years now and have been a premium user for about as long. I have used both Apple Music and this and they are both fairly comparable. No instability in the app and the ‚Äòdiscovery‚Äô portion is my favorite part. I like finding new artists based on what I listen to. A larger discover weekly plst would be a very good addition. Keep the progress coming.
The best music app I have ever used
Listen I don‚Äôt care about any other reviews that pepole give you Spotify your supposed to be #1 in music,but unfortunately pepole can‚Äôt be perfect,but I LOVE that you send me E-Mails for free trails and I would like to say THANKYOU!
just give us that button
Great app for music!!
Spotify or ‚ÄúSpoofy‚Äù as some like to call it, is a great app. I‚Äôve been using it for almost two years and the only problem I had is that sometimes it would crash for no apparent reason but it was rare. Hell, I‚Äôm listening to Spotify as I‚Äôm writing this review. I would recommend Spotify to anyone who has different tastes in music and hates switch channels like on Pandora.
It‚Äôs a 5
Best app of all time
The variety of music is very good!!
Great app.
It is amazing and worth the try!
Has great music and yeah I like it
Great music app
Must have music app for those music lovers!!!
Awesome. I've tried all of the paid ones and I still come back to Spotify
Great quality of music! Highly recommend!!
Good
A vast library of music and it keeps growing, and I use it everyday. Just what I needed.
Good app for music.
Spotify never fails to amaze me in terms of the content and recommendations- it‚Äôs wonderful!
Much more variety and control!!!

Historically, I've been a purchaser of records/albums. When there was an issue with my iTunes account and I lost all of my music, I decided to try Spotify.   It seems to be a great alternative to buying all of the aforementioned records over again.   I have been using the free version, but the pay-to-play version is a great deal, as well. I will be upgrading later this evening.   Definitely try it out if you've never used a streaming service before, or if you're stuck using that Pandora BS.   St√•rw√•lker. 
Great service - great selection
I used to love this app- as a non-premium I‚Äôm willing to tolerate the excessive ads, and the shuffled playlist, and the occasional ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù song. But recently? I go to a playlist, it plays a few (think 4) songs from it and then plays an hour or so worth of recommended (and totally unrelated) songs that aren‚Äôt even from the same genre. Then MAYBE it comes back to the playlist, plays one song, and goes back to random other songs. I also don‚Äôt understand the ‚Äúup next‚Äù feature. A song could be listed as the next one on the ‚Äúup next‚Äù and then ten random songs will play before it (if it ever does, in fact, come on). I can listen to a playlist and hear the same 5 songs it always plays before switching to random recommended music, meaning I will never even hear the other 100+ songs on my playlist. I‚Äôm not going to listen to five hours worth of songs from a genre I don‚Äôt even like (random pop and rap songs come on ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù most often...) just to hear one song from a playlist that I put together. I have switched to Pandora. The free pandora app actually brings up new songs in the same genre as the ones you‚Äôre already listening to on each station, and cycles through the songs you ‚Äúthumbs up‚Äù fairly regularly. I check back in on spotify every few months to see if they‚Äôve fixed these issues, and since they have not I will no longer use the app. Might want to keep up with the competition a bit more.
All the hits !
Love Spotify!
Always have the most up to date music!
Seamless music streamed anywhere is a dream and with the ability to watch a short ad for ad free music it'll keep you listening.
Love this app so much but lately it‚Äôs been having problems. Can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs just my phone or the app but so many times it will stop my music when I get a Snapchat notification. Also the other day I had my sound up all the way and I could barely hear it. When I played music from iTunes and YouTube a couple minutes later the sound was great so that was just a Spotify problem. Not sure what‚Äôs going on here
Very cool!
H
Cool thing you guys made.
Better than iTunes and iHeart Radio, premium is very much worth the money
I made my account today. I have used Spotify before but it had been a long time. Didn‚Äôt know by passwords anymore. I clicked download and it asked me if I wanted to try Spotify premium for 30 days free. Usually it says 7 days which is great too. But now it‚Äôs not letting me do the premium free trial and won‚Äôt let me download! Really hoping this gets fixed.   I used to LOVE Spotify but now idk. 
Indi dibanyakin lagi + lirik
Monica, you know Spotify. Come onnnnnn!
Still the best!
I can hear all the tunes I choose, I love it!!
This is free and it plays better than iTunes besides the ads but that doesn't bother me
Love music
Can‚Äôt complain really about anything when you have premium
Great
It‚Äôs free and u don‚Äôt have to buy songs
Wonderful app!!
Me encanta Spotify
Always just disregarded this app. Glad I gave it second chance!!!
I'm a music lover. I can listen to music 24/7 so this app is definitely my favorite!!!!
Spotify is the current standard in music streaming. If you enjoy music you would be foolish not to get a subscription.
This app is getting it all together, just take all of the review into consideration Please 
Love this app a lot!!! Best!
The radio channels actually blended the genres I‚Äôm into and introduced me to new bands and styles I haven‚Äôt heard before. That and the commercials aren‚Äôt the worst thing ever. I‚Äôm actually going to a concert now because of how helpful it was.
Really enjoy the experience and the UI is amazing
Love the Bollywood collection
Spotify is the bomb student discount plus Hulu is where it's at Apple Music can eat a can of expired beans
Use it everyday
I‚Äôm speechless
This app is better than Apple Music app.
It's a legit app all it needs is the mix tapes of the artist & there is some artists that has no albums & it a lil sad beside that its a coo app....if u buy a album a month this is the app for you
Do you think Apple will take down this review because of the title? It‚Äôs the best, the curated playlists destroy Apple‚Äôs. Keep it up Spotify
I absolutely love this app!! I listen to it everyday
I love it!
Big gay
I think that I love this app all the music and everything but I wish you could make it so that you do not need to use wifi or you do not have to waste data
By far my favorite app for music!
Great service
OK I WANTED TO KNOW CAN I DOWNLOAD THE SONGS THAT I WANT AND WILL THEY BE ON MY PHONE TO PLAY WHENEVER I WANT TO IF IM OFF LINE ARE ON LINE I JUST WANTED TO KNOW THAT SO I CAN BE SURE THAT  IT'S NOT LIKE PANDORA WHERE IF YOUR OFF LINE ARE IN OFF LINE MODE YOU CAN'T PLAY ANY MUSICK AT ALL UNTILL YOUR BACK ONLINE OK  BUT SO FAR SPOTIFY IS REALLY FUN AND E.Z. TO RUN AND LOOK UP AND DOWNLOAD STUFF 
I like Spotify, it‚Äôs gud!
Does what it should and is straight forward.
Better than google play
Music choices are great and ads are minimal. I like how the music continues to play even when I go out of the app to do other things on my phone. I enjoy using the Spotify app!
The only thing I would change, is taking some of the things from premium and putting it with the regular
For me it's better than any other music app out there. HIGHLY RECOMMEND
Perfect
I love it for work and school
Best music app
Appears to be a bug on iPhone X
Whether for working out or finding the perfect playlist for clients to listen to at my place of biz. Spotify is always my first choice.
i hate it
I like it because it's like Pandora but better
Coo
Great app. Offers just the right mix according to your preferences!
Love that I can have music and podcasts and customizable tracks. I just need it to have a widget for iPhone so I can access suuuper easily. Please!
Honest review:   I have used a variety of music streaming services and hands down, Spotify is the best.  - The user interface is stupid simple.   - Every album you could think of is on here and Spotify updates new albums every Friday (New releases).   - Spotify curated playlists are awesome!   - Student discount!!!!   - Offline mode is perfect if you plan on traveling to a place with poor signal.   - Other apps have a lot of bugs and it drives me crazy. Spotify does a great job at squashing any bugs.  If you need a reason to download this app, simply try it and then try other services. You'll come back in the first week. 
Yup. Neato.
I am so god I can download an awesome app! which  allows me to praise God freely!thank you Spotify for your plethora of great awesome music For dancing, singing and hopefully D.J. One day! 
The only problem is when I play artist records they play other people I never heard of and every 3 songs is when they play my selected artists
This app is perfect for me to get pumped up before my hockey games.
With the flick of your finger Spotify allows you to a access millions of songs instantly. With an exception of ads I‚Äôm able to listen to hours on end of songs.
Hello, starting today‚Äôs morning my app is repeatedly crashing after few seconds of being open. I‚Äôm using iPhone X. I tried reinstall the app but it didn‚Äôt fix issue.
We need an offline watch app for playlist! Please !!!
The best music
I love everything about Spotify. Great music, easy to use, and well worth the price!!
Awesome
Great musical options available.
Everything I could ask for.
It is cool i like this a lot thank you for your gente decisions
Great music selection and ability to create playlists!!! Love it!!!!
This app is THE way to listen!!! Thank u!!!
I Enjoy this app daily and everywhere
Really good for music
Need more grupo massore
Always playing the jams whenever you need them  Great services Spotify üëç 
Nothing to hate.
Been a loyal user since ‚Äò15 If you guys could add a sliding thingie to help scroll down faster that would be really helpful. Rn I have about 1000 songs and it takes forever to scroll down. I know you have a filter feature but just saying lol 
I was using YouTube red for the longest ya it‚Äôs great but they charge to much a month just so you are able to close your screen and listen to your videos. Don‚Äôt get me work gatherer are benefits to youtube but if you want a better control, flexibility and more money in your pocket at the end of the day I recommend Spotify.
When I meet someone who doesn't use Spotify, I immediately question our relationship.  It takes some convincing to not categorize ‚Äúnotspots‚Äù with flat earthers, 9/11 truthers, or anti-vaxers. Reasonably, In response to these groups, one wonders if some should surrender their abilities to make decisions all together.   Anyway..... Spotify is great. You should use it.

Great choice for listening to music!
It‚Äôs amazing you don‚Äôt have to pay for anything
A good app for ps3 and pls4 and Xbox one and Xbox 360
Awesome Music
It is perfect. It is great to use when riding a motorcycle.
First of all, family loves Spotify! From our individualized playlists to actually discovering new music we like, it delivers exactly what it promises. The ONLY suggestion for the developers is to come up with a way to play music in the background even if you are using the video function on your iPhone camera. I run Spotify from my iPhone and my kids dance around the house but, when I go to take a video to show grandma, the music stops. I know I can run Spotify from a different source but, these days, I pretty much use my iPhone for everything. Don‚Äôt stop the music!
Fantastic and diverse range of great music!
Best music app out there, i can make my own playlist and play any song i want, and i dont have to buy every song, 99¬¢ is worth it
It would be nice if some features from the desktop program are implemented to the app, such as the ability to view your friends‚Äô listening activity. Overall, smooth performance and cool/easy to navigate interface. I really like how it‚Äôs dark themed unlike the Apple Music app which is too bright for my taste.
So far so good
Worth paying the membership üòÉüëçüèº

Spotify brought music back into my life during hard times, something that somehow slipped away from all the constant chaos of my life. I‚Äôm rockin my balls off now!!
I love this!
Amazing music player !
Great app! I get to listen to songs that IHeartRadio doesn't have. Quality mixes with great songs from Bethel, Elevation, etc.
Spotify is a great app I love listening to music. Spotify has almost every song.
It works consistently. Selection can‚Äôt be beat. Personalized playlists and sharing playlists.
Definitely worth it. Great app. Great customer service
Offers so many suggestions for any vibe you‚Äôre after, and the app consistently works well. Spotify is amazing!
The best app for music
Still has some things that they can update like when I select an album it should sink right away also more choices on the radio with new material or variety other than a great App:)
Best app out there.
Great option for music!
I love this app but, I only listen to sad music (my chemical romance, and twenty one pilots newer songs) I would tell all my friends to get this app if I had any of those
I love my new jukebox it provides a massive selection for all music for my many moods!
Greater music selection than any other app out there
Better then Pandora. Nd that‚Äôs what I was using. On to this now. Nd You get to create Your Own Playlist. My Homie told Me about this. I See You Spotify. .. Stay Up. ..
I couldn't find any more music like this
My life is before and after this app. Spotify makes every day a good day
Best music app by far

Best music app ever
Once upon a time I wasn‚Äôt completely frustrated with Spotify. I love music and always have it playing. So i loved Spotify once. Once upon a time when you got ‚Äú30 minutes ad free‚Äù it was a real thing. Spotify no long plays the songs on your playlist unless you have a LOT of music on a playlist. Im talking 50+ songs on there. It has more and more ads then ever before, and the ads are back to back. It used to be a 30 second ad once in a while. Now its 3-5 30 second ads in a row then a few songs later there are 2-3 more. It doesn‚Äôt do what it promises EVER unless you want to spend so much money a month, which come one people, its hard enough to provide for yourself anymore these days, so why spend the money on this app? I used to be completely fine with ads, completely reasonable for a free version, I also did not mind having to shuffle my playlist, also occasional songs not on my playlist being put up there once on a while  wasn‚Äôt terrible. When it was 1-2 at the end of my playlist. But now I can hardly play anything i would like to. Some of us really don‚Äôt like certain songs and a lot of songs are very offensive to a lot of people. So you need yo watch it with the suggestions Spotify. Also your suggestions never even match up to what i‚Äôm listening to. Im very disappointed in Spotify and rather upset actually. I‚Äôve only recently tried using it again after not having it for about 8-9 months, but it was all to just remember why i left before. Spotify needs to fix this. You guys are offending a lot of people with your music ‚Äúsuggestions‚Äù i‚Äôve noticed and you are lying to your non-Premium customers about your features. Also what happened to the tap and hold to preview the song? Why would you even get rid of such a small but important feature? Im tired of having 5 skips and having to use all of them because music that isn‚Äôt even in my playlist keep bombarding me. I‚Äôll be switching to Pandora, and if I were to pay for a music app, you can bet i‚Äôll be taking my business elsewhere.
Honestly , BEST music app out there. You can listen to any song for free , and this app is just all around perfect. Not glitchy , keeps all your music organized , and there is hardly an adds. Get this app , you WILL NOT regret.
üëç
At this very moment, all the app is playing is what I saved in my library a few hours ago while on shuffle. I‚Äôm a premium member (in which I love by the way) and I have a mixture between music that was released in the 80‚Äôs to within the last month. I would rather keep listening to what I saved last year than what I saved an hour ago.
Hey. So now the new Snapchat story that lasts longer than 10 seconds is broken down!? No. Not happy. I don‚Äôt care who listens in 10 sec to intervals, it was a ‚Äústory‚Äù that lasted longer than 10 sec. give me back the old story!!!
Basically worthless unless you pay for premium
I love this app!!
As you see 5 stars!!
Great app
Well for the review you should have kept the fast raps like the can you keep up, mista tung twista or add the tung twista running off da mouth thing but I like this app,dome split by twista insane, and from da tip of my tongue by twista so that all I have to say.
I‚Äôm begging you ;)
I lovvvee this appp
The app is ok but if you make a playlist it will play random recommend songs that arent on the playlist, which, Spotify, it is very annoying to some people who just want to listen to songs they know.
I like Spotify it‚Äôs super cool
We‚Äôll know more soon. These ‚Äúrate me 5!!!!!‚Äù Pop up way too fast on apps.
I love the range of songs! But I wish Spotify Premium was free for everyone.
Perfect app
I have tried all of your troubleshooting and Spotify still will not go online? Help! 
having access to all the music i want consistently had truly changed my life! love this app!
Love the HD sound
Scrolling is ridiculously laggy... it gets worse with every update and this app used to be relatively smooth, massive framedrops ruin the experience and even cause miss-clicks, like when adding a song to a playlist... I still love discover weekly and release radar though! Barely keeping me from switching to Apple Music..
I think it would be great if the app had a sleep timer option so i dont have music playing all night as i sleep
I think that Spotify is a great app for portable and for your use of speakers they have veriety of songs and even radio is and potion too. So far Spotify is great and is  deserves 5 stars ‚Äú. This was written by a 12 year old btw üôÄ.
Perfect for simple easy to access custom playlists.
Needs Apple Watch app to be 5 star
Most music apps are pretty basic but Spotify takes it to the next level. Even without buying premium it‚Äôs still a great app. They have tons of playlists that they‚Äôve created and you will never be bored of them. They have 6 daily mixes for you and they all include different artists. I would always recommend this app over any other streaming service because Spotify adds the personal touch to their app.
Love it !
I love this app. Great music app
Best music app !!

I love Spotify. It's my everything. But sometimes it‚Äôs annoying with the ads if you don‚Äôt get premium.
Ok I was listening to my fav music then the app corrupted plz fix this =((((((((((
I love Spotify but, I have considerably large playlists and it is often hard to search specific songs inside said playlists. It would be nice for you guys to include a search engine inside the playlist or the ability to sort the songs by artist or alphabetical order. Thanks!
Legit
Its great I love the variety of music
Pretty satisfied with this app. Would give this a four star if I didn‚Äôt have premium (which is totally worth it by the way.) Although they do not have all my favorite albums, it is still by far my most used app. Weather I‚Äôm skating or studying, Spotify helps me do my best. They also recently sent me a pretty sketchy email saying that my package was shipped. After about three weeks it came and low and behold there was a t shirt from my favorite band. Although is it was three sizes wayyy to big, I am very short, it was still nice to see that there is some rewards for having premium.
I personally think that it‚Äôs better than Apple Music, what do you (the person reading this) think and why?
You. Are the reason.   For everything. 
Better than all the other music apps
I will have my favorite songs on my playlist. Then I‚Äôll have songs that aren‚Äôt on the playlist play. Please stop this because this is extremely frustrating
Just get premium  I wish Spotify had the licensing for more music to be hosted however. 
What else is there to say?
I love Spotify ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Has a the songs that you want
I have had premium for over a year, and due to a billing issue with iTunes, I went back to Spotify free for a couple days. Before upgrading to premium, I LOVED the free version, but the premium version definitely had me spoiled. Both versions are great and premium is a little pricey, but definitely worth it.. Customer service is great too!
The best app in the universe!!!üòçüòç‚ô•Ô∏è
Litty
so so good
Cool app
@eduardoswaze on instagram
Smart and awesome. Great way to find new music.
Great app, it is great to use when I'm in the shower! So many of great songs including ALL my favorites!!
I love ‚ù§Ô∏è Spotify it‚Äôs free it has great music and whichever song you want.
I need your love from pentatonix doesn‚Äôt want to play
When i just want to listen to one song i cant unless i pay $10 a month for unlimited skips. Its really annoying
Way better than any other subscription music service I‚Äôve ever used...and there have been many.
It is cool
ITS LIT
Great Music.
It's pretty okay, I mean I hate the fact that you have to shuffle all of your saved or favorite songs if you haven't purchased Premium....
Good
All day every day.
One day my ability to see my list of downloaded tracks disappeared from my library, making it much less efficient for me to listen to the favorites on the road. Very frustrating.
Awesome
Hey, it‚Äôs free (with ads)!
Awsome
ITS SUPER DUPWR GOODüëßüèæüëçüèæ
Great music service and really has everything you need in one app! Has a lot more variety and community curated playlist compared to Apple Music
This app is great uh i love it
Would give a full 5 but some of the lesser known artists only have select albums available. (Obviously I know why but it does affect the rating) other than that no complaints.
Pay for it... Love how I can play songs and do other things on my phone‚Ä¶ And it works with my echo
TY!
Spotify has become my go-to for all of my music. No more downloading, hunting for artists, albums and finding space to store all those gigabytes. Sure they could implement a few features that would make it even more awesome, but even so, Spotify is the best $10 I spend each month.
This is an amazing app especially when you get to try out premium. It has a great variety of songs of your choice
Love Spotify music.I can choose any song!and I enjoy the songs.Theres even sleeping music!
This app works great not every song is here sadly but that's to be expected. But regardless this app works great and is great
Awesome
Muy buena aplicaci√≥n gracias
The easy way to listen to music
A great way to discover new music!
The app provides a lot of exploration that can give listeners what they need. Premium is great, it‚Äôs just like having Apple Music, for less. Good job Spotify.
I love it, you guys who made this is gineus(I‚Äôm 11)
I like music it‚Äôs cool
Love the app!  Works great
Great
I love using Spotify. I just used to listen on my iPad while doing homework or writing my stories or texting. Just any app that I use that will allow music playing. I get to hear all my favorite songs! I love Spotify.
I use Spotify more than I use any other app on my phone. I love the personalized daily mixes they make for you, and I feel the radio is on par with Pandora. What makes Spotify better than Pandora is they have a wider variety of music. I will continue to use!
This is bar far one of the best music apps you can get.
This is the best music app i have ever had and what like the most is that if you don‚Äôt want to pay for it they don‚Äôt obstruct your experience too much to where the app becomes annoying
Can‚Äôt even make an account
Thank you Spotify Ltd.!
Love Spotify although I do wish when I clicked to watch a video for 30 min of add free it wouldn‚Äôt glitch at the end logging out of Spotify
Has everything I‚Äôm looking for with no commercials! And I got hulu
Does its job
This app is amazing‚ú®
it‚Äôs a great app
GG NO RE!
Top notch app!
Do it
I tried this, and was excited, but the app doesn‚Äôt let me listen to my actual music, and gives me some dumb suggested one instead.
Love it. I Recommend it
Better than SoundCloud üôÑüôÑüôÑ
Kind of hard to fine the musici like on heat for me
Super app
I love it but with premium duh üòÇüò§ü§§
a must have !
Spotify is absolutely amazing! If I could,I would rate a million stars ‚≠êÔ∏è!!! I LOVE SPOTIFYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!>
One of the Best things I ever had
Great song, great App
Been going back and forth with Apple Music and Spotify lately and a ton of my favorite bands/artists end up releasing on Spotify first, or making great playlists with their sets in them. It‚Äôs really enjoyable üëèüèæ
Spotify is by far the best music streaming company out there!
I like Spotify but recently when I play my playlist I hear songs that I didn‚Äôt add. When I try to skip them another song that isn‚Äôt on the playlist is playing. If I want to listen to other tracks I will listen to one of those R&B playlist or something. I might as well use SoundCloud if I want to hear random songs playing.
It is a f***ing amazing app for music
Amazing
Just got Spotify premium and it‚Äôs the best. Would strongly recommend this app for musicü§ó
üëåüèæ
Gr8tü§©
It‚Äôs annoying on less you pay for it but it‚Äôs not that bad I would recommend it
Has everything to listen to, and you can close the app and still listen!
I‚Äôve been using Spotify for almost 3 years now and I love it
Spotify is the best
Nice app
I‚Äôm  Also A Artist On There . My name is ‚ÄúItsZo‚Äù.
I love Spotify!!!!
Definitely A Match!
That's it
I love this app
It‚Äôll randomly freeze, closing the app doesn‚Äôt fix the issue, only restarting my phone
I am an old time one from in the 1950's and I always look some different. Sometimes  I find albums that but at still there  is others. Thank You
Goid job
The best music app out there for sure! Premium is the way to go, makes pandora look like a punk!
I don‚Äôt mind the ads, but maybe you guys could add a few more skips?

Best music app hands down worth the money
Get it
M√∫sica todo el d√≠a y noche
I really like the app, and the downloading feature. The fact that you get a 7 day trial of premium is also awesome.
Still missing a few songs I really love but pretty awesome app
Enough said.
It‚Äôs a nice app
It's nice, and I recently got premium, but what the hell is up with all its crashing?! Fix it or me along with others I know will be deleting
I simply love this app! For a small amount a month I simply have all the songs of the world!
I just upgraded to the family plan and and super happy with it!
This is an awesome app but could make a way that you could listen to ONLY your saved songs?
This is one of the best music apps I‚Äôve seen. The quality of the music is extremely good. Some improvements that could be done are, I think it‚Äôs unfair that computers get to skip songs and phone, you need premium. I have to get all the way home to skip music! üò•üò•üò•
Have never tried Spotify until now and I loved it. I‚Äôve always had Apple Music.
This is like the best app for music!!
Ok app
If I wanted to be hear new artists, I would use Pandora. But no, Spotify says, ‚ÄúHere, spend time creating a playlist that you won‚Äôt get to listen to because we‚Äôll ignore it and suggest non related music to you instead.‚Äù
The greatest
Great
Great, no complaints
I wish there was more personalization with playlists and accounts but other than that, it's a really solid music service.
I have only had this for half an hour and I already love it I wish it were free but the cost is worth buying for a little download
Cancelled Apple Music for Spotify,  best decision I‚Äôve ever made.
Love this music app
Love it
(Sorry about spelling above) this is the best freakin app ever!!!!!!!
Great
Great way to learn new classics from my favorite composers
Fantastic! Love the long periods of commercial free listening!

Spotify - it‚Äôs the best esp for listening off line or 6 family members
Love it
Great selection of music. Of course there are ads with the free version, that‚Äôs business. You can upgrade to change that if desired. Really like the choice to play complete albums.
Everyone in my family uses it every day
Is so Dope!!

I remember when Pandora was the only option you had for portable music, without purchasing every single album or song online. When Spotify came out, I absolutely loved it ‚Äì you had tons of selection, and rarely do I find a song that I want to listen to that I do not find. I have millions of playlists for different things ‚Äì and when I‚Äôm in the mood to discover something new, I like the Discover weekly that you have. I‚Äôve been a member and paid the $9.99 monthly ever since you offered that option ‚Äì I love that I can be in the middle of a lake in an unknown place and have my favorite playlist :-) I know that Apple Music is around now, but Keep on Keeping on! Thank you for the service you provide.:)
I really love it but I hate having to pay
My favorite app to play music!!!!!!
It‚Äôs great
It's cool, and also useful, I guess.
It is a very good app especially for iPad and desktop, but a problem that I ran into for this version is security, and by that I mean when I hit sign me out everywhere from Spotify account overview this did not respond at all where as all my other devices across all other platforms imaginable did.. apart from that it is a very good music service that offers more for the amount your paying that any other service out there.

Love spotify,
Works exactly how it‚Äôs supposed to
Spotify is very user friendly and makes finding new and old music a breeze. Having the ability to download some songs to your phone to listen to without using data or WiFi connection is ideal. For me this was essential to being able to use my playlists on the mountain all day with my phone on airplane mode!
I have given this app 5 stars.
It is my all time favorite app for music
I‚Äôve been using Spotify for years now, I try to convince every person that hasn‚Äôt tried it yet to give it a shot because the perks of premium are worth it! Will continue to use on the daily!
It‚Äôs great
It is good
üëçüèæüëçüèæüôèüèæ
The only thing is the pay for premium because i can only do shuffle is a little annoying but overall the best
I would really like there to be less premium features or have it be at least less expensive. Good music but you need to improve a bit.  Thank You,     Spotify User 
This is the SH!T!!! Create the playlists That YOU want to hear. Mot√∂rhead followed by Bob Dylan...YEAH! I created that!!!
It‚Äôs lit
Cool
Everything you need, easy, mobile
Skajjssj Kdkdkdj 
I love this app has a great selection it's easy to use and gives you easy access to your music as well as new music.
Cualquier plataforma y trabaja bien con Musixmatch
Better then Pandora and Apple Music, thanks for getting it right!
ü§ôüèªü§ôüèª
Love it!
Also, can u pls give notifications when u have a chance to get 30 minutes as free by watching an ad?
I love that you can make playlists and be in any mood you want with Spotify. Sometimes I need calm classical and others I want to pump up the jam!
It is great everyone should use!! üòçü§§
This app is perfect for getting work done. Focus Flow is an amazing playlist.
Won‚Äôt let me try the free trial
Amazing
Perfect
I have been using Spotify every day for two years and still cant get enough of it!
In love with app.
Everything would be perfect if it didn‚Äôt keep adding random songs to my playlists, it pisses me off, it keeps replaying the songs I didn‚Äôt add to my playlist never giving me a chance to listen to the songs I added on
It‚Äôs great
Spotify!
Dropped pandora and its commercials for good!
Love being able to control Spotify from my phone. It saves my computer crashing from too many alt-tab actions!!
Love everything about Spotify!
I used to use Pandora, but I got tired of all the adds. I didn‚Äôt get premium because I don‚Äôt pay for music. Paying for music is ridiculous lol we‚Äôre not in the 90‚Äôs anymore lol Both Pandora and Spotify have their pros and cons, but I like Spotify better. Less adds, and when you choose  a station, Spotify is more on point. Spotify and YouTube are my go to‚Äôs for music now üòéüëåüíØ
Great variety of music regardless of the genre. Your spirits are put on a musical high.
One of my most used apps. But they took away the most useful feature, in my opinion. The downloads tab that had all of your downloaded music all in one place has disappeared. Now the only way to view your downloaded music is through recently played lists, or going to album/artist tabs then filtering downloads only. This is a tedious process, and it‚Äôs a much less organized way to view my downloaded music.   If this feature isn‚Äôt replaced, I will probably cancel Spotify and move back to Apple Music because the main reason I pay for Spotify is listening to downloaded music in my car. 
Love listening to the radio
Spotify is absolutely excellent! An amazing music service! I recommend it too all ages, all genre selections. I love Spotify!!!!
Great selection of music!
This is probably my favorite app out of all my apps but there‚Äôs just too many adds, I know I don‚Äôt have premium but sometimes I‚Äôll get two to three ads in a row that are all the same. Also, way to many ads leads me to not getting premium because sometimes they get really annoying. Another problem is I will play a playlist and then after two to three songs, some random song not in my playlist comes on and I skip it to either find another song that‚Äôs not in my playlist or I don‚Äôt have any skips left. So in all, this is the best music app except for the fact that it has way too many ads. 
I love Calum ever since he performed this song on Xfactor! I could listen to this song over and over!!
The best music app ever
Let this app purify your material world and send you on an endless voyage of joyfulness. Simple, clean and easy to use. Digital has never been more practical.
Great music app
Who doesn‚Äôt like easy access to music? It‚Äôs so easy to use. Great music
I love putting this app on in my free time and while at work for some relaxation and a pick me up when I need it.
Wow es s√∫per buena
Great music
has a very wide variety of music. love it all but the fact you have to pay for spotify premium. LOVE IT!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
All music offered is OUTSTANDING and SPOT on!!!
I like this app a lot honestlyüåπ
I am really enjoying the music today.
I LOVE THIS APP!!!
Best music streaming service I‚Äôve come across so far! Please keep up the great work!
If you want a music streaming app that works across all platforms and does it well then choose this one
Love the app. It works great
Loves the app
Our family loves Spotify! We have 2 accounts! The kids love having music from the movies they watch, the teens love the variety of today‚Äôs music, and my husband and I love to choose a mix of classic rock, classical, jazz, country, and easy listening ‚ÄúSunday chill‚Äù playlists.
Yeah
I've been using Spotify for over 7 years and it's the best music app out there. You're killin it it's worth the $$
I can listen my musics because I don't have spotify premium, so please change this... :(
Easy to use. Playlists are great! They have about 80-90% of anything you could ever want to listen to. 
Great app love it been using it for 4 years now

WAYYYYY BETTER THAN PANDORA BRO . haha my dad and i argue which is better but uhhh spotify is just amazing, thank you and keep making better updates üòä
Great
For some reason I have to restart my phone every time I get in my car to get it to play Spotify music. Not sure what you did on feb 1, but you should undo it. It‚Äôs annoying
They horny for money so many ads
I‚Äôm just rating it cause it told me to. But I really do like Spotify.
Yes
Amazing app
All of my family and mostly I use this app but some of the reviews I think are not really explaining the app in thorough detail so let me tell you pros and  cons about this app Spotify is used by millions of people explains why for some cases it might lag a lot so to prevent that problem what I do is I  just go to my multitasking folder and just swipe up that resets or refreshes the app and that is really the only con I've experienced with. This app but let me tell you the pros first this app has all the music on earth and also has sounds of waves birds and many more

What a disappointment! I used to have this on another device and loved out. I don't know why they ruined it! Navigation is terrible. I have tried many crosswords apps and have not liked many. I was so happy when I found this and then was totally disappointed.
If you enjoy crosswords this the best app, period. In my day there was an advertising phase "no one better" that meant you needn't look any further for a product. SHORTYZ, meets the criteria for "none better". You just need it.
Love the app! (Seriously, where can I donate?) But please fix the animated "downloading" icon in the menu bar, it keeps animating even after all downloading is done and only stops when I drag down the menu and swipe it away. A tiny inconvenience for such a great app, though!
Good app, easy to use. Needs a little polish. It would be nice to have new puzzles default to 'Hide Errors', I ruined many a puzzle by starting off with 'Show Errors' turned on by mistake. Also, clue navigation should jump to the next line once one line is done.
I'd rate 5 if this had a scrollbar on the puzzle list. Please, please add one. Really tired of swipe scrolling to the bottom.
I've had Shortyz installed for almost 5 years now and it's become almost a nightly routine. There's a good selection of puzzlesand easy sorting options for which you'd like to view.
It would be sweet if the user could disable multi-touch zoom altogether.

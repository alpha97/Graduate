Hey friend I like your game very much but hearts solitaire is missing in this game please add hearts solitaire in these game.
Works good! No ads!!! Thank you! Please add Hearts.
Best solitaire app...got it on my phone and tablet. Wish I could download it to my pc?
Good app but the graphics are so small you need a magnifying glass to play the game
this app is going to cost me /hours/. very nice. thank you.
Best solitaire collection out there. Love it. Thanks. Been playing it awhile now love the changes.
Thank you for making this so simple to play on mobile.
For those of you who played the hell out of the Ken Magic Solitaire app and are disappointed that it's unplayable since it hasn't been updated in seven years, this is the replacement you want. P. S. It's even better, with more games, a smoother interface, and still zero ads. This now takes the title of the best Solitaire app on Google Play. Thank you, Tobias!
Problem with Vegas Solitaire. Unable to reuse the discard pile. They will not return to the main pile!!! I enjoy the variety of Solitaire options on this app.
I've now been using this game for six months and have changed my review. It is superb. Great selection of solitaire games. Card speed is configurable.and best of all no annoying ads. Great job. Love it.

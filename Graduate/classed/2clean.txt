I can‚Äôt search nor can I purchase items on the app now.! Please fix this problem. üò°
App is not working form me, as soon as I click on an item all I get is a blank flashing screen! As much as you charge me for prime and music I should have no issues. Because of this, I am seriously thinking about canceling! Shipping is never one time , you couldn‚Äôt even get a gift card to someone in the expected time!
This app isn‚Äôt bad, but: Whenever I add anything to subscribe and save, it adds the item but at the same time, I get a pop-up telling me something went wrong. Clicking on links back to products ordered usually sends you to an oops page with a dog on it. Notifications are random. Worst of all - it‚Äôs useless with Amazon links from browsers. Click on a link in safari or chrome to take you to say an amazon page to manage your prime tv channels? It‚Äôll open up this app and tell you the page isn‚Äôt available.. it was at that point I decided to delete this and just go back to the web. 
I should have been able to change my address by now. Get some better interfacing amazon!
The app has trouble doing so much stuff it‚Äôs just easier to go on desktop. Can‚Äôt even add a new address through this app
One star for reeling me in to get the app with a $5.00 gift card and then never sending it to me.  After reading the reviews, it‚Äôs not a far stretch to just delete it.
Very quickly becoming more of a pain in the butt than a convenience.  Causes more frustration than anything.  My packages lately have either not been delivered at all or beaten up so badly that the items inside are damaged. Skip Amazon.
Never got my $5 gift card for downloading the app. It‚Äôs been 3 weeks. üò°
You know what this review is about Amazon. Fix this issue. Let us know where you stand.
I use to love this app til my account got hacked and amazon did nothing about I asked them to delete my account and I make a new one and they didn‚Äôt do that. Every time I make a order something always goes wrong or they say they shipped my items and on the day it‚Äôs supposed to be here it‚Äôs never here and they said something went wrong with my order but yet charge me for it. So I‚Äôm done with amazon!
GET RID OF ALL ADD ON ITEMS, I can‚Äôt order anything at the time I want, if it is an add on item and I have to spend more money if I want that item. That‚Äôs is the worst design ever, if I want something I should be able to get it.
Everytime I try & buy something it errors out & says ‚Äúunable to load to cart‚Äù
Finger print verification is always a problem. They send code to email but I always receive those codes after 2-3 hours later.
When I was buying a portable charger everything was going fine until I got to the checkout and it wouldn‚Äôt actually let me buy it. I thought it was a glitch at First or my iPad wasn‚Äôt working properly, but then I tried to buy a 1.00$ item and it still wouldn‚Äôt work.( the first item was eligible for free shipping but even when I selected the free shipping option it would not work) I do like the app but it stopped working and needs to be fixed.
Cannot add Shipping address
Under Menu I see nothing about seeing all programs ot a treasure truck.
Am I the only one experiencing problems with the app? It‚Äôs not loading pictures or it‚Äôs always telling me their always telling me ‚ÄúAmazon encountered an error. Please try again shortly‚Äù and it crashes. Makes online shopping a hassle üôÑ
For as long as I can remember, I have always toggled my ‚ÄúSave Browsing History‚Äù to the off position. Lo and behold, every time I open the screen, a whole page of every item I‚Äôve looked up recently or placed in my order cart is present. I delete the history, I check to make sure the setting is toggled off - which it always is. Next time I use the app, same cycle. Browsing history saved.   What is the purpose of this? I know exactly what I looked up and if I want to purchase it, I will place it in my cart. I don‚Äôt want a reminder or record of it, especially when I have specifically set the feature to the off position.  Also, I despise having the ‚Äúgarage‚Äù and ‚Äúpet‚Äù feature in my account. I will NEVER use Amazon for car parts & services and I don‚Äôt own a pet. Why not make these features optional instead of having them take up space?    I‚Äôve been an Amazon shopper for over 17 years and your app makes the shopping experience a poor and annoying one. I am using your services less and less as time goes on. 
I would love tmfor you guys to stop getting rid of the easy access wish list at the bottom of the screen. It‚Äôs so convenient. Would love for you want to keep it there or at least put an option in the app for people who want it there and for people who don‚Äôt. :)
Took me 45 minutes to order ONE ITEM. app was not responding. Had to keep writing in my info about 8 times. Almost gave up and went to a different website.
I thought I was gonna love it then my orders gone day revise payment method and they never like it happens to everyone scammers
Using the app to make purchases has always been very convenient and useful. Lately though? Not at all. I have to use the website on my desktop to actually place any orders because I can‚Äôt sign in. Touch ID doesn‚Äôt work, and when I type in the same password I use on the actual website it gives me the same message every time. ‚ÄúSomething went wrong, try again later.‚Äù Every single time I try to buy anything or even just apply a gift card to my balance. Why do I even have the app still?
Only giving one star to get this fixed. This has been like this for months.  When trying to select recent reviews on a product the screen just darkens but no prompt comes up. I just want to see the most recent review in a product. 
Trying to add new ship to address during checkout and the process starts over with the new address not saved.
I LOVE amazon and shop here all the time for what I need and even have there credit card, which I love. The only thing I don't on this app is there is no way to see my credit balance or a way to make a payment. I have to resort to getting out my laptop, logging in, and checking my balance and make a payment. I would love this app way more if I can check and pay my balance through the app. PLEASE make it happen
The new update wont let me to sign in. It became useless for shopping unless i sign in from the browser
I really like this app, but prefer to use amazon smile.. hope soon this will be an option with the app.
Amazon calls itself a tech company but cannot deliver an app that is fully functional. Oh, sure, you‚Äôll be able to place your order and pay for it but you may not have the same features from one version to the next. The last update removed users ability to vote on whether a review is useful or to flag a review or even to report a product that is fake, dangerous, or raises other concerns. Also users ability to ask questions about a product is gone.   The app NEVER has offered all of the options that the website does. Nor do all the options offered even work. I seriously doubt that Amazon even tests their app. 
Every time I try to order something, my order gets cancelled. I love amazon, but this is making me very mad.
This app used to work flawlessly. Recently, the app began saying ‚ÄúSomething Went Wrong‚Äù every time it asks for a password, which is WHENEVER I want to buy something. I have to close out of the app and log in via browser and finish the purchase there. Why even have an app at that point?
Hardly ever works, hardly ever shows pictures when searching, can never access My Lists, half the time won‚Äôt let me change sizes, add to cart, change colors, leave feedback....works less than 30% of the time
Option choose square totally broken
Very good app and amazon the best goods and services of online marketing and shopping thanks for all teams in amazon
Will change rating when app is fix.
Since the last update the app continually crashes just after opening. Can‚Äôt do anything with it. I deleted the app and downloaded again with no change.
Please fix. App crashes every time I open it.
Can‚Äôt do anything the app is crashing in about 20 seconds every. Single. Time.
The app wont let me see my order history. As soon as i click on Order History, it will ask for ny password and after entering the correct password it will just keep loafing. I will have to click on some other tab and then back on Order history to see the list but as soon as i click on any past order, i will throw me back to Password screen and same thing will happen that it will just keep loading after the correct password entry. I also can‚Äôt change shipping method/speed through the app, if i click on the shipping tab, it will just take me back to my cart. It is so annoying. I have just started using the mobile web browser version instead.
I lost my job because I was shopping on this app and when you add something to the cart, Amazon obnoxiously thinks it's okay to vibrate your phone and this feature cannot be turned off. Needless to say my boss didn't appreciate the vibration that came from my obsessive online shopping disorder and fired me... Thanks Amazon!
The only thing that works on the app is buying stuff. If I want to access my account to manage anything it tells me something went wrong.
New update won‚Äôt let me search, my ‚Äúsave for later‚Äù is gone, everything in the left-hand menus says ‚Äúsorry, something went wrong. Please try again...‚Äù.
Searching and viewing products works great. When I try to checkout I receive an error message after putting in my password. I am unable to purchase any items from the app and am forced to resort to the website.
Amazing app, I buy everything frequently from mobile Amazon, particularly stuff from Daily Deals, only bug I sporadically see is product images disappear when I‚Äôm deep down in the default list view. Please fix and maybe even add a feature to save place (in list) and deep link back to same spot after a time sensitive LD checkout.
This app, while offering gorgeous design, cannot complete the singular purpose of Amazon: to purchase a product. I've never once been able to complete an order, always getting some error message and being forced to wait until I can get to a computer. I expect better; this is such a disappointment.
I had an account and I had used a $50 gift card I used some of it but after a few months of not using the app all my information was gone to my account event my money. I had some help but it still isn‚Äôt fixed. However amazon is a good shopping app.
I‚Äôm tired of finding knock-off items with bogus reviews.   Amazon, you need to do something about this NOW.   ALSO. Fix the notifications. Why is there always 1 notification that won‚Äôt go away. 
This app tells me ‚Äúoops, something went wrong‚Äù anytime I try to do anything besides browse. Or it just keeps taking me back to my cart after I choose my delivery address. I end up having to use safari to order anything.
App goes into an endless loop when I try to check out. Perfect way to stop me from buying anything, ever!!!!!!!!!!
The latest update on this app is not good.  While looking at an item, I can‚Äôt pick a different color or and quantities to purchase. There is an arrow for selecting the color or quantity but it doesn‚Äôt work. I have to go to the online store (not the app) to select color or quantity.  I really hope they fix this.
It has been a while that I couldn‚Äôt submit orders using app. It kept sending error message after I typed in login info. After put items in cart it looked ok until I clicked ‚Äúsubmit order‚Äù. It came back to the same page without submitting the order. I sent feedback to amazon and was told they were aware of this issue, but it has been weeks and I still face this problem. I just deleted this app.
If I could give a 0 Star I would! This new app is horrible every time I try to sign in it states sorry something went wrong! I‚Äôm fixing to do away with Amazon and their Prime that really is a joke to begin with
Ever since the previous 2 updates, when I try to log in, it‚Äôs says ‚Äúoops something went wrong‚Äù and then is stuck on the ‚Äústill loading....‚Äù page. I know I‚Äôm using the correct password cause I can login on the website. I can‚Äôt order or track an order from the app, I have to go to the website to do both. Very frustrating.
My only complaint currently is that Apple Pay isn‚Äôt a functional option for me. I use it everywhere else and up to a month ago used it on here. Now there is no way to use the tool that I feel is very secure and safe with my money. Any feedback on what has transpired with this problem would be greatly appreciated.
App won‚Äôt let you click on and use your reward money after update happened
Ever since your last update whenever I sign into your app on my phone I get a message that says something went wrong and to try again later. I am writing this here because I couldn‚Äôt find anyplace to submit feedback on it.
Can no longer sort my wishlist by price drops. Please bring it back!!! Also when you add an item to a wish list, there's a little box that pops up. Even if you close the pop up box, it stays open everytime you add something to your wishlist. 
The ap is great except for the fact I can‚Äôt leave feedback on some items. There is no option.
No option to leave seller feedback in app. Cannot do in mobile either. MUST BE ON DESKTOP? FIX FIX FIX!!!
I get REALLY tired of my shipping preferences being shifted to standard from free when I try to correct or change my order. Really guys it l hate ordering from you and find myself using jet more and more.
Look like the shopping list at the bottom disappears after the update.  I can‚Äôt find the setting to enable it.    It is very convenience to have that list there so I can drag shopping item there for quick review and comparing at a later time.   Please put it back or provide an option to enable it.  Thanks 
I adore amazon but this app is super buggy - it won‚Äôt let me log in or place any orders. If it worked properly it would be 5 stars.
Major problem: Cannot use pull down menus on any item pages.   Also seems like a big waste of space horizontally which also means I have to do much scrolling for info. 
This app is my number 2 shopping app I use for all time but just need to add more things in there, not much option lol. Maybe a little more about Asian stuff? Since me and all of my friends r recommended by me using the app! I love how it‚Äôs primed, but NEED MORE products and things are little pricy. Thx
I can no longer look at my previous orders! Everytime it asks for my password and says and error has occurred and won‚Äôt let me view anything!
My mobile app stopped working in December after I reached out to support I‚Äôve been told that it‚Äôs a known issue and they are working on a problem. No update since then. The app crushes every time I‚Äôm prompted to enter my password.
New app closes or puts you in a loop for checking out. Stalls. Forces you to use the app even when trying to do anything on Amazons web page via web browser. Horrible build and major issues
I can't sign in since the new update, had to use the web browser to complete my most recent transaction. Please fix soon!
Had to change my password and all of sudden nothing was working on the app. Even after I was finally able to enter my new password it wouldn't let me place any orders. Didn't even give an error. If I clicked "place order" it just took me back to my cart. Endlessly annoying. Had to delete the app twice and reload before it allowed me to place orders again.   New bar on bottom of the screen wants me to drag items there to save. NO THANKS. My phone has limited screen space to begin with. I hate annoying banners that I cannot get rid of. I use my various lists to save items if I want. Worst feature ever for mobile, please get rid of it! Starting to get super annoyed with Amazon lately and with all the negative things I hear and read about their business practices and the way they treat their workers I'm rethinking my Amazon usage.   The best thing Amazon had was their reviews and now they've revamped how stars are calculated and with all the fraud rampant on their site with reviews I just can't trust any reviews now either. And why are all the Amazon prime items $10 more than third party sellers offering free shipping?!? We are already paying $100 a year for prime plus a huge markup on each individual item?? This is starting to seem like a ripoff. I guess all good things come to an end. 
Keeps asking me to log in. States there‚Äôs an error when I hit ‚Äúplace my order‚Äù.  But I can change my credit card info and add to cart. I have to log in to web page to place order
It never lets me reset my password! Once I get the code section.
3 times of trying to add an address for a gift it closed out sent me back to shopping cart and eliminated all my gift card info and the new address.  The other 3 times if told me there were invalid characters in the phone number.  Area code, check.  Actual seven digit number, check.  No dashes or parentheses, still nope.  Any combination of dashes or dashes and parentheses, still no.  I guess Amazon doesn‚Äôt like numbers in a phone number...............
Everytime I scroll through my cart, when it loads more times it will duplicate what's in my cart, so I'll see 3-5 of the same item. Frustrating as can be.
I used to be able to use this app before Christmas, but now it doesn‚Äôt allow me to select cards and even typing in the Password and will error out. 1 Star for messing up your app. Fix it ASAP!!
I can‚Äôt sign in and I can‚Äôt view my orders. It just says something went wrong and to try again later. I‚Äôve tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it doesn‚Äôt work
Won‚Äôt let me proceed to checkout
no touch id. won‚Äôt save password. forces you to constantly re-enter password. huge time waster.
The shopping cart has no feature to allow the user to continue with payment and shipping.
I try to change my payment to not use my gift card balance and it just takes me back to the order page.  Also when I log in it always gives an error message although it seemed to work.  I expect more from Amazon. 
Why am I being asked to put in my card information for a free app to update?
I had issues with the app for a long while despite it‚Äôs up to date. Issues such as it keeps saying ‚Äúloading...‚Äù when viewing account or scanning gift cards. After I deleted it and reinstalled it, it works again. I also noticed the navigation interface had changed also. So be aware that App Update doesn‚Äôt always work. You will have to manually delete the app and reinstall it. 1 star less for this glitch.
Amason used to be great but now they are just money hungry. First off if you have a amazon gift card you can‚Äôt use it unless you have a credit card...change that because not everyone has a credit card. Secondly you can‚Äôt order an item under $25 anymore your entire order has to be $25 or order. Amazon needs to realize that people don‚Äôt have that much money. And I hate the ADD ON ITEMS you have to actually buy something else with it. Honestly amazon needs to think about this. Guess I have a gift card and can‚Äôt use it
No Touch ID support? Ask to log in then says ‚Äúsomething went wrong‚Äù. Complete trash. Can‚Äôt look at my orders. Can‚Äôt believe this is from amazon. Unbelievable
Great app, would love to minimize the wishlist tray.
I can‚Äôt use the app without getting that message. I can‚Äôt check my last orders or place new orders. You can buy Whole Foods but have a shaky app?!?
Impossible to access Account settings, which don‚Äôt show in the menu. I.e. cannot view Prime Membership details or payment options. I have tried to report the problem to Amazon through their feedback email/chat, and was connected to 8 representatives whose only concern is to refer me to someone else. I hope they read these reviews.
Get rid of the one click purchase. I‚Äôve bought things on accident 3 times now.
TURN THIS OFF, you may buy something of high cost and not even realize it! I am not too happy>:|
App used to work great. But the last two updates broke it all over the place. Touch ID no longer works. Can‚Äôt change shipping options. Can‚Äôt even CHECK OUT!  I‚Äôm using the browser version. 
Whenever I change the sorting to priority(high to low) and I change the number or priority of something on my wishlist and save it, it goes back to the default sorting. I wish it would stay in the priority (high to low) setting.
After the latest software update, the app no longer works properly. I can search for things but I can‚Äôt view orders, place orders or add things to my cart or wishlist. And today it won‚Äôt allow me to sign in. I keep getting a message that says ‚ÄúSorry, something went wrong. Please try again.‚Äù
Love the app. Buy all my textbooks from amazon. But the app keeps saying ‚Äúsomething‚Äôs wrong‚Äù when I sign into my account through this app. It‚Äôs fine if I type it in using a browser though. Definetly needs fixed.
Literally can‚Äôt save anything or drag anything to my wishlist. This app has been like this for at least the most of 2017!!! Was hoping it be fixed after how constantly like every week there‚Äôs always an update and it‚Äôs Amazon IMO data eater!!!
Some sort of glitch when I go to my shopping cart to purchase my items, it makes me long in again, then tells me there is a problem and to try again later üò° so frustrating!
My go to online shopping platform.
I am not receiving shipping delivery alerts. The setting notification is turned on but no message is sent.  This requires to consistently looking up manually the order status from the App.  Please enable the notification.
You guys are simply amazing! The app is so user friendly! I couldn‚Äôt ask for a better shopping experience! Thank you! This app runs great on the X!
I cant view my orders or buy anything without the app telling me something went wrong. So im not sure what this app is really for at this point.
Every time I‚Äôm redirected to login to view my account it says ‚ÄúSorry there has been an error‚Äù. Every time. Started before Christmas and had to do all online shopping at a desktop. App isn‚Äôt great
Put an option to disable it because it is aggravating that it pops up EVERYTIME I save something to my wish list. It's ANNOYING!!
I‚Äôve tried to make purchases but keep getting the ‚Äúsomething went wrong‚Äù error when I try to complete the transaction. If I try to make changes, like picking a different card, it sends me back to the shopping cart. I also have similar problems when checking out order history after I go through a login prompt.
You use it I use it everybody uses it saves you time gas energy and most of our money!!
This is such a bad thing I have never seen like this. Every time I add 4 items it‚Äôs just saying I can‚Äôt get free shipping. Each stuff has option to choose free shipping but some items doesn‚Äôt and if I try another time it never works. Please do something. This is makes me feel irritate.
I love shopping on Amazon but two fixes are needed. They need to stop charging my credit card for prime when I don‚Äôt even sign up for prime and every time I try and look at an existing order, I enter my password, and it always says an error has occurred. Then I have to use the web version of amazon. Please fix this error message and allow us to use TouchID for our password.
It appears with the latest update that the app is freezing terribly. This wasnt happening before... now its almost impossible to shop!
Overall I really like using this app, but it gets 3 starts for 2 reasons: the number of bugs, most recently the issue with the top taskbar becoming unresponsive after a few minutes (have to view a wish list then search from there to make it work).  My biggest issue though is the service from USPS. Just like I‚Äôve seen others mentions online and in my apartment building, there‚Äôs a real issue with getting packages delivered.  At my building, if it‚Äôs the weekend you‚Äôve got maybe a 50/50 shot of it arriving, they will lie and say they cant‚Äôt ‚Äúaccess the building‚Äù, when in reality they just don‚Äôt try to deliver it. Amazon will give you all the sympathy in the world, and even extend your prime membership but they just don‚Äôt get that no one cares about that‚Äîwe just want our stuff on time! They need to switch back to UPS or FedEx and stop being cheap! 
Unable to check the option to use points. Happened after the last update.
Usually works great but today it‚Äôs freezing every time I open it. Also, disable list tray. I placed Christmas present ideas In lists and every time I open the app it shows the items which defeats the purpose of hiding them in a list.
Cannot use top menu bar at all. You add something to your cart and you cannot checkout.
This app has too many glitches. Half the time I have to get on my laptop to order products. Every time I go to check out on the app something goes wrong. Either I get stuck in a weird loop of clicking the same buttons over and over or there is just an issue and it won‚Äôt allow me to proceed with my checkout. I pay for a prime membership too and I have yet to be able to use my benefits because it will never allow me to on my phone. Thinking about ending my relationship with Amazon all together. They really need to step up their game if they want to keep happy customers.
I‚Äôm rating the app a 1 star rating only for the simple fact that the pesky tray feature is absolutely annoying! I can hide it, I can minimize it, but no matter what I do I can‚Äôt ever seem to get rid of it. It‚Äôs absolutely annoying that every time I save something to one of my wishlists, that stupid tray will automatically pop up again. If it wasn‚Äôt for this feature, I would have give the app a 5 star rating because other than this, I absolutely love this app.
The app won‚Äôt let me update anything! After trying to checkout 50 times, when I finally get to the checkout I can‚Äôt update shipping, point preferences etc. When checking out it asks for my password then I receive a ‚Äúsomething went wrong error‚Äù but if I keep trying it finally lets me checkout. Then in checkout it won‚Äôt let me change to free shipping or choose to use my points or not. It glitches and throws me back to my cart. Seriously the most frustrating app ever. I‚Äôd rather go to the store and buy what I need than have to mess with this dang app!
You guys broke the nav bar!!! When I first open the app the nav bar works great. BUT, after I select YOUR LISTS I'm taken to the default list, fine. But then when I try to change to a different list, shopping cart or do anything in the nav bar NOTHING WORKS!!!! Frustrating!!!
this last update my app does not work anything stays stuck
DON'T THESE KAZILLIONAIRES HAVE ENOUGH CASH TO FIX THIS MOTHER FUKKING APP GET IT DONE SLACKERS
I love amazon but the app keeps freezing, won‚Äôt let me search anything after the new update. I have to completely restart the app in order to search for new items. Wish list items are showing up as duplicates when the wish list tray is not hidden. Please fix these bugs
I get error messages when logging into cart to submit purchase and while i‚Äôm attempting to review past orders. It also has been crashing when I change delivery address before purchase. I have to move to a web browser to finish purchases.
I get an error message stating, ‚ÄúSorry something went wrong, Please try again.‚Äù as of lately everytime I attempt to checkout, update subscribe and save, review orders etc....  That seems to be the only thing the app can do. 
With the last iOS update, my Amazon App is freezing up. I cannot go back, click on the menu, or search. It's completely frozen. I have to close out the app and begin my search over. Which, if I'm searching for something specific, is a pain in the butt.
It's been working well with no issues until lately.  Every time I go to purchase something, I get a something went wrong error.  Doesn't matter what I do.  I spent an hour trying to make it work to buy a little $10 present for my wife. Please fix it.  In the mean time I won't be buying anything from Amazon.  It's NOT worth the hassle. 
So this app which was a good way of ordering stuff quickly is little by little becoming a bloated app whose purpose is to deliver ads to you.  It‚Äôs starting to feel Orwellian. 
Many touch events are not working in the latest build released today. I wish there was a revert to previous version option.
I bought a golf cart off Amazon and now the app inundated me with ‚Äúrelated‚Äù items to this purchase but all they show are more golf carts. If I just bought a golf cart from you, why would you push me to view more golf carts. Can‚Äôt disable this view either. So now I am stuck seeing golf carts when ever I go on the app.
I find an item in my list select the item I want to purchase again. Goes to screen continue shopping not to purchase, go to cart And same thing I can not purchase just continue shopping. You now know why I DON‚ÄôT PURCHASE MORE ITEMS.
Amazon ended up locking my account when i couldn‚Äôt confirm a card i didn‚Äôt have
New update today and I still can't login. I get the "Oops something went wrong" message that plagued the previous version.
I would like to make a recommendation to improve your app dealing with entering new card information. Could it please ask for billing address instead of defaulting it to the shipping address. Many of my orders are not to my home address which is my billing address
The touch login doesn‚Äôt work, rendering the app useless because it requires it instead of password login. My touch login works on other apps.
Literally loved this app until a few months ago. The app requires to enter password OR to use your Touch ID to either review past and recent orders, and to make purchases. As others have stated it does not work and says ‚Äúan error has occurred‚Äù.   To make it more irritating every item I had in my ‚Äúsave for later‚Äù has completely disappeared. So I had to relocate things and just put them in my cart when I was ready to buy or having it sit in my cart until I can get to a computer. It won‚Äôt even link up and show when I go from the app to the computer either it turns out. 
Can no longer view my orders without signing in several times and can‚Äôt place my order it force closes. Please fix! I love and need my Amz
Whisper automatically redirects me here repeatedly to give you a poor rating. Just following through with what feels right at this point. Stop constantly redirecting me here and my review may change.
I love the app except for one thing.  I don‚Äôt want to have to verify my stupid credit card for purchases regardless of where I choose to ship it. It makes my purchases less convenient because when I‚Äôm relaxing and shopping online, I don‚Äôt want to go get my wallet and dig out my credit card info.  My Account has a password, my credit cards have protection against fraud.  Please don‚Äôt over regulate me.  Ugh!!
Bought a Xbox and PlayStation gift card 30mins  ago and still didn‚Äôt get the code
Used to be great... couple weeks now I can shop, add to cart, etc. Now when i click check out it scans my face, acknowledges, then goes to a white screen and says error.  If i cancel and try again, it'll go, but then if i try to change shipping address, payment method, or anything else, same issue.   have resorted to the mobile web site. 
Any time I try to sign in, it says ‚ÄúSorry something went wrong. Try again later.‚Äù I just end up opening up chrome on my phone to buy stuff.
This used to be a great app and how I did 99% of my Amazon shopping. Now, I can‚Äôt even use it. Forces me to login every time, Then tells me something went wrong. If I can make it past that loop, I have to re-login multiple times. I can‚Äôt ever get to checkout, I get stuck in another loop to select shipping address then back to my cart. Serves no purpose to my anymore which is a bummer because it used to be very convenient and 5 start quality.
The only way I can order anything through amazon is through the actual website. I‚Äôve reset my password, I‚Äôve tried signing out of the app, I‚Äôve tried uninstalling and reinstalling and no matter what I always get a BS something went wrong error message. It is SO frustrating to be able to shop in the app and browse all I want while signed in, but then I go to check out and it makes me put in my password and I get an error message. I‚Äôve contacted customer support and they can‚Äôt figure it out either.
Every time I try to place an order I get kicked back one step (review your order). Every time I try to view my past orders I get caught in a "enter your password" "sorry something went wrong loop". This has been going on for three or four MONTHS. To actually place an order I have to use a mobile browser. Amazon is a massive tech company. Get it together, Jeff Bezos! You're slippin'
This app has so many issues. The most annoying is when you try to review one of your purchases and are denied because it allows only "verified purchases" reviews. And yet you're trying to submit it from your purchase!! Horrible app.
We use a long password of well more than 20 characters. The App does not allow sign in with that. Instead it says: ‚ÄúSomething went wrong. Please try again later‚Äù
App won‚Äôt let you delete receiving recommendations, nor will it let you delete notifications on Today‚Äôs Truck ... very unfortunate.
The app doesn‚Äôt let me check out... takes me back to my shopping cart after I pick a shipping address. App is useless if I can‚Äôt buy my items unless I‚Äôm on a physical computer
This is a great app to shop and purchase Always feel secure in my payment There is no down side
Sometimes one LEGO set looks the same as another. And when I save it to a list I have to go through the list to see if it is one I already have on that list so it would be cool if you tried to save the same item you already saved a message or something will say you already saved it.
Mobile app on an iPhone 6s has become very buggy during the checkout process in the past few months of updates.   Right now I can‚Äôt even check out, no error messages. Just keeps going back to the cart after picking a shipping address. 
I noticed tonight that the app seems to have an issue with the bottom portion of the screen on my iPhone X. Kind of a bummer that I cannot select things if they‚Äôre on the bottom edge of the display.
Recently, I cannot checkout or see my previous orders using this app. When the app asks me to login and I do, there is an error message on the screen stating ‚Äúsorry something went wrong‚Äù. When I get to the final step in the checkout process, it sends me back to my cart.
It‚Äôs crap because every time I order something and I go out of the app then come back it‚Äôs gone so I have to re order it and stay on the app
My default payment method is a credit card, but Amazon always defaults to my gift card balance. I used to be able to change my payment method back to a credit card. Since I changed my password I can't change payment methods. Makes the app unusable. I think amazon should be better than this.
Idk what happened but recently every time i click on anything, it‚Äôll ask me to reenter my password and the after i do ‚Äúsomething went wrong!‚Äù will pop up and i cant move forward, i have to go back to the menu options. And its gotten so annoying that i have to leave a poor review. I love amazon and buy from them all the time. But when I'm being asked a literal 6 times to sign in/enter my password to do ANYTHING in the app, it gets freaking annoying. Id rather use walmart‚Äôs app. At least it doesn't harass me. Please for the love of god, fix this bug.
I have NEVER had this issue with my Amazon app and I am a heavy user of Prime. Use it to buy almost everything except groceries. And even then I use Prime Now pretty frequently.  -Won't let me choose shipping, keeps putting me back to checkout overview -Keeps logging me out -KEEPS ASKING TO RE-ENTER PW EVERY NEW PAGE 
Amazons app is useless and unusable. How can a tech giant like amazon publish such a poor excuse for software? Do they not use it themselves? Like others I can‚Äôt sign in, can‚Äôt change payment method, can‚Äôt check out. I thought it must be just me but I see now it‚Äôs not. This app runs me around in circles. Worse than useless.
This app is basically useless. It won't let me add stuff to the cart half the time, and when it does it is never able to complete a purchase. It prompts you to pick an address and a payment and then back to the address and then payment...over and over again. The software is trash and needs to be debugged.
I have uninstalled and installed the app and the same issue pops up despite updated app. I can‚Äôt successfully order anything. It asks me to enter my password and then says there was an error in retrieving the app. It doesn‚Äôt merit one star   Hoping this bug gets fixed. It‚Äôs been like this for at 6 months.
I love the amazon app, the experience is normally so easy and very user friendly BUT ever since the beginning of December it has been glitching way too often! It asks for my password every 5 seconds and doesn‚Äôt allow me to use touch-id instead. Every time I want to view my orders or my cart, it says there was an error and eventually after fighting with the app it allows you to view these things. But the whole app as a whole recently has just been BAD! Amazon needs to address these bugs and do a little update on this app. Once it is glitch free, I can give the app 5 stars but for now I can only give it 1 since there‚Äôs no option for 0.
I've been scammed twice now on this app for 50 dollars that I wish I could have back. If you want to save money, use a different online shopping app.
The current version has several annoying bugs but the deal-breaker is that I can‚Äôt place an order!! (1) Touch ID does not work at all. Even after I enter the password manually, I‚Äôm prompted to re-enter it every time I select a different menu option, change lists, access the cart, etc. (2) after logging in manually, I receive an error ‚ÄúOops, something went wrong.‚Äù I have no idea what that would be, because the app still lets me continue doing whatever I was doing. (3) this is the important one - PAY ATTENTION AMAZON - I can‚Äôt please an order through the app. When in the Shopping Cart, I click proceed to checkout and I‚Äôm prompted to select the Delivery address. Not a big deal except the app previously showed the default address, which could be changed if needed. Now I have an extra, unnecessary step.  Then I click Deliver to this Address, the app returns me to the Shopping Cart. Really?   I‚Äôve uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but no improvement. 
Sometime in the last few updates, my Amazon app no longer allows me to make a purchase or to search my orders. After inputting my password, I get "Oops! Something went wrong!" Every. Time. Don't bother downloading this POS app because when you choose "app support" in the store, it sends you to a pointless faq page that doesn't actually allow you to send in feedback. Save yourself the headache and just order from a web site. Also, I hate that I can't turn off notifications that I never asked for, don't want and don't need.
Amazon‚Äôs app will never be truly great until  it supports touch id or face id features.
Can‚Äôt place order.  It just returns user to proceed to checkout - looping forever.  When try to display orders it asks for the login again (even if I just logged in a minute ago).  The login completes  and then displays a pop up box saying  there was a problem try again. You click ok and the app hangs saying loading information  Minutes pass.  When you get tired of waiting and go back to the item, again you get into the same loop.  Sometimes you can get in on the 2nd or  3rd try, just did 8 try and still didn‚Äôt work.  This app used to work fully and now my am pretty useless - Been a month since this version was released and no fix in sight. 
Yo dude, I think the app updated and now it won‚Äôt log me back in, aka when I go to submit my order it tells me to enter my password then I put in the password and it says ‚Äúops something went wrong‚Äù  I‚Äôm trying to spend money but ops something went wrong 
I accidentally ordered two things with really high prices and I need money for something, and it‚Äôs not close to shipping but they said they couldn‚Äôt cancel the order.
The app is easy to use and visually appealing, but I‚Äôve twice placed orders accidentally cause of the ‚ÄúBuy now with 1-Click‚Äù button that is purposely placed where the ‚Äúadd to cart‚Äù option is on the website. Obviously this is no accident by Amazon, and I find it quite frustrating and disappointing. I feel less inclined to use the app at this point.
When I try to scroll down the page in the daily deals, the page will automatically scroll back up a few items making it very frustrating to keep my place.
Why can I not buy e-books on this application? I suspect I know and it‚Äôs stupid! Why can I not watch videos on iTunes? The copyright laws in this country are idiotic. But the only place I‚Äôm able to buy any book is on my laptop online, so dumb? This app is virtually unless!
I thought it was great you could by literally anything but the one thing i cant stand is that there is no option to minimize the wish list
Used to be a great app, but now the app doesn‚Äôt work for most things. Not sure what Amazon is doing, they have screwed it up so it doesn‚Äôt work. This will definitely affect my purchasing habits.  I cannot view past orders, cannot load gift cards, etc.  it keeps asking me to log in, I log in and then it says ‚Äú...oops something went wrong try again later...‚Äù.   I guess I should try Walmart‚Äôs app.
It constantly asks for me password which I correctly enter but then will say that there is an error. Well, the error still lets me submits orders properly. So which is it is it?
Update: I noticed another person was having the same problems as me. They deleted app and downloaded again. This fixed all my problems.  App wants my password, then says something went wrong. Then it goes to info anyway. I can't check out. App will unexpectedly quit. If I am looking at my orders it will suddenly go to enter password, and it all begins again. This is not the first order I have had a problem with. Last update needs some work. I am thoroughly frustrated!!!  I have no problem on Safari. 
The app will make you sign in, immediately say an error had occurred and then if you try to access that page again it will suddenly work? This bug is ridiculously annoying.
Every time I try to order, it says ‚Äúsomething went wrong‚Äù and then sends me to a loading page that never loads
It worked fine until the last update. Now I can‚Äôt do anything without a screen popping up and asking for me to sign in despite the fact that I‚Äôm already signed in. Then it gives the message of oops something went wrong and I‚Äôm back where I started. Please fix this!
The application prompts for authentication way too often. I cant do anything without it prompting me for my password. If you have a highly secure password like me then entering it every single time is very frustrating.  Please relax the reauth requirement. I would luv to shop and check my orders wo being prompted.  Also entering amazon gift cards prompts for password and then gives error. 
Was good until last update. Always has errors when placing orders now and for some reason my finger print isn‚Äôt signing me in anymore and not taking my password. Works on safari though.  It says ‚Äúsomething went wrong‚Äù. So annoying!!
I can‚Äôt use this anymore because I keep getting the ‚Äúoops something went wrong‚Äù every time I have to enter my password. It won‚Äôt save my password either. Very frustrating. If I want to access Amazon I do it through a web browser.
I put $50 onto my account to buy a playstation card. I confirm the purchase and it shows i buy it. Then it gets cancelled automatically and then when I thought I finally got it to work, it says my account has been disabled. Will I ever even be able to use the $50?
AMAZON ALWAYS WANTS ME TO SPEND MORE THEN MY GIFT CARD BALANCE ! OVER TIME AMAZON HAS BECAME REALLY GREEDY SHIPPING SAYS FREE WHEN IT‚ÄôS REALLY NOT!
Every time I try to view my orders it says there is an error. Every time I try to checkout there is an error. Every time I try to change my list settings there is an error. But I can get on my laptop and do everything just fine. Fix this bug please it‚Äôs so inconvenient and renders the app completely useless.
I downloaded the Amazon app for the ease of shopping on my phone. However when I use my finger print it just says ‚Äòsomething went wrong‚Äô and never loads. The same thing happens. It‚Äôs made the app virtually unusable. I might just delete it.
Can‚Äôt buy or access or print gift cards with the app. After Face ID is approved, error message says ‚ÄúOops... something went wrong.‚Äù What‚Äôs going on?!
I can‚Äôt get rid of the badge notification for this app, so I am temporarily rating the app a 2; I‚Äôll come back and adjust to five whenever this is fixed.
Can‚Äôt add things to cart in fresh without crashing the whole app.
Why can‚Äôt I change the shipping address?? When I try to change it, it exits out of the screen and reverts back to the previous page! So annoying!! Please fix.
Thanks to the most recent update, when you try to add to cart or checkout, you're given a error message, "sorry, something went wrong," and nothing happens.   Similarly, thanks to the update, you can find yourself stuck in checkout purgatory.  Clicking "place your order" will revert your screen to "proceed to checkout."  Fix these bugs that didn't previously exist. 
The app is great I've been using it for years but lately things are glitching or just not working. One thing that I've noticed is when I go to review items that I've purchased and received it won't let me, it says I have not purchased the items. The app is very convenient and useful but could use some maintenance.
There's a persistent notification badge icon that won't go away and I have no idea what the notification is for. Also, "default to these shipping preferences" never defaults to those shipping preferences and that stupid shopping bar at the bottom of the screen won't stay away. I'm just gonna start buying local again. Amazon is corrupt.
Get $20 off when you get app and sign in... blah blah blah.. didn‚Äôt want the app.. got it because of the promo and never got my coupon .. been almost 2 weeks.. will be deleting now
The app makes you jump through hoops to  ship to a new address, but after jumping through those hoops, if you're not careful, it will simply ship to the default address. Should be smart enough after adding a new address to ask if your should go to the new address. Poor UX.
A lot of functionality is broken. I can‚Äôt even buy things in my cart... it keeps asking me to select a shipping address. Just one of many major bugs.  Usually amazon is better... on iPhone X FYI. 
Can shop and place items in cart but when I hit ‚Äúproceed to check out‚Äù it says ‚Äúsomething went wrong‚Äù. Sometimes I can get to the check out page and when I select to check out it still gives that error code. No problems with acct - I can order just fine directly on the website
STOP TAKINGGGGG MY FUKKIN MONEYYYYYY IF YOU SEE I DIDNT FUKKIN PURCHASE IT IN MY NAMEEEEE!!!!   I WANT MY FUKKIN MONEY BACK OR ELSE IM TAKING LEGAL ACTIONS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Won‚Äôt let me use Touch ID or sign in
Well, I can‚Äôt log in these days, either by touch or by logging in. I keep getting a ‚Äúsorry, something went wrong, please try again‚Äù error. Then I‚Äôll go back later and it works for a little bit then throws up the touch login screen, error, try to sign in, error..... endless frustrating cycle. So amazon... you want my money? Fix the app.
Every time I go to order something it has me choose the shipping address over and over again or it will pop up with a message that says ‚Äúsomething is wrong‚Äù I love amazon and I pay for prime. Please fix the app so I can buy things or else I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth it to pay for prime.
I can't place orders from the app.  I saw another review with the same problem, that when you hit 'proceed to checkout' it asks which address to ship to and you can't get past that!  It just slams you right back to the cart!  I have to go to my browser to actually order!  And the Touch ID always has an error!  The current version of the app is just a mess!  I will say that for the most part it works like it should, but just not the important parts!
I love amazon and use it multiple times a week to online browse and order whatever (batteries, vitamins, gifts, etc..), but recently the cart (save for later) has this weird thing that makes viewing my saved items impossible.  When you scroll down the app wants to show you ‚Äúother items‚Äù similar to what you have saved, but all it does is refresh my screen and make it where I can‚Äôt ever scroll down!  Infuriating!  Also, not a fan of that wish list pop up tray at the bottom either.  Just takes up room and it‚Äôs not needed. 
About half of the time for the past few months, every time I try to use the app to view my past orders or change my subscribe and save, a ‚Äúsomething went wrong‚Äù notification comes up. The app is basically useless half the time.
For the past two weeks I am having a hard time logging in to my account on the app. I have to utilize the web version just to sign in. Which can take longer. It‚Äôs becoming more and more frustrating. When I sign I‚Äét I get a notification that reads something went wrong. It‚Äôs not my password because I use the same password for my the web log In and I‚Äét works perfectly fine. I‚Äôm goin to give I‚Äét one more week. If not. I‚Äôm deleting this app. Makes no sense to have something I can‚Äôt use.
I added something to a list and several hours later when reviewing a different order, discovered it had been ordered. I a, confident the app was at fault because I had other items in my cart that were still there. No one touch buy screen came up, and for some reason I didn‚Äôt notice the email amid others from Amazon. I tried to cancel but they said couldn‚Äôt, to which I said not my problem. 8 hours later I get a shipping notification ‚Äî meaning they had plenty of time to stop it but didn‚Äôt, so now I have to deal with all the nonsense.   This was a useful app before, but it appears to have a very inconvenient bug at the moment. 
I haven‚Äôt been able to log in to the app in weeks. It asks for my password, then says something went wrong and won‚Äôt let me do anything. I can‚Äôt view my orders, place orders... anything past the login screen.
Neither FaceID works, nor just the plain old password. I‚Äôm forced to use my PC to view orders. Please fix. It used to work fine. Same goes for changing payment method once in the checkout. When I click on the payment method (in order to change it), it simply reloads the cart instead of offering me the option to choose one of my other payment methods. This app is a complete disaster on iPhone X. 
App has ‚Äúproblem occur‚Äù every time a password is put in.
i always say - give your product/soft to your granny to try. If she is able to use it than  its cool. Why did you place the swipe action Further Info on the scanner page at the bottom? As a result in 90% of cases i swipe up to open the phone's control panel. Also there is the terrible violation of privacy: i must accept your outrageous demand to send scanned photos to you. Never happens. Rolled back to previous version 7.x - it does absolutely everything i need. 
Resets to view cart after adding a new address, no support for Apple Pay or any pay.
All is fine except one thing: I have to delete and reinstall the app once in a while, or it‚Äôll constantly pop out a window says ‚ÄúSomething was wrong blablabla‚Äù when I try to log in
App will no longer allow me to checkout, just sends me back to shipping address continually. Also is now making me sign in with my password every time I want to do anything and gives an error telling me to try again later. Obviously some pretty bad bugs in the app right now (Absolutely love amazon this review is for the app). When the app works it‚Äôs a 5 Star app.
Every 3 mins or sooner the app shift to a screen asking for my password again and again and it always says ‚Äúsorry something went wrong please try again‚Äù .  I have never been able to buy anything with the app so it has failed in its very purpose! I wish I could give this app no stars.
This wish list that pops up is so unnecessary.  I plain out hate it every time Im scrolling down and just happen to hold it for just a second too long for that thing to pop up.   Next thing I know, I dragging this item I have no interests in, knowing that if I let it go it will automatically be added to the ‚Äúwish list‚Äù.  I‚Äôm already addicted to online shopping, I don‚Äôt need any extra help adding ‚Äúwish list‚Äù to my well organized catalog of lists.  And to be clear, aren‚Äôt all lists technically a wish list.  If you could buy them that instant you wouldn‚Äôt need a list to begin with.   Redundant , just plain redundant. 
I have no issues logging in my account with my password but once logged in everything I navigate through the app (such as orders, account, payment) it makes me enter my password again and then gives me a message telling me ‚Äònot working, try back later‚Äô ?????? Why can‚Äôt u buy anything or use this app anymore? I have the correct login and password. Please fix issues and update this app it needs it!!
All of the sudden I can‚Äôt use this app anymore. Every time It asks for my password and I put it in, it just gives me an error message and takes me back to the main menu. The rating would change if the app worked
Amazon, you realize that login inside the app has been broken forna really long time, right? I can't change password, change treasure truck location, etc? Anything that requires a password, I get a "something went wrong, please try again" message after submitting password and then the page reloads withoit completing whatever I was attempting to do. It's been like this for many app revisions.
Wishlist:  - Make the checkout a full page instead of a tiny pop-up. - Accept ApplePay. - Allow AmazonSmile within the app. 
Cannot process Face ID, constantly asks for password and crashes - terrible timing for glitches with holidays approaching, and I have seen no recent updates.  Has worked well in the past, but they really need to fix for X.
Login failed is all I keep seeing even though password is correct. Then it lets you in but I can‚Äôt change payment method and kicks you back to cart. Ugh.
This app has become awful. Every time it asks me to enter my password I receive a pop up message saying, ‚Äúsorry, an error has occurred.‚Äù Now when I try to enter my gift card, it won‚Äôt process it and returns me to my shopping cart. What gives?
Whenever I access the My Orders screen (and even at some random times), it asks me to confirm my password, even if I already am signed in. I understand the security, but it should only need it once for when I open the app. If I'm checking multiple orders, I will have to enter my password upwards of ten times. Intrusive and ridiculous. Pretty decent app otherwise. Would be better with fixing this issue, and allowing the viewing of sub-departments as online. e.g. Electronics>Tablets>iPads. This is possible to find, but not easy.
Since the last update, the app crashes whenever I try to change a shipping or payment address, look at previous orders, or browse more than 2 minutes. It kicks me out and makes me enter my password‚Äîevery time. Not fun to deal with close to Christmas :/
I don‚Äôt know what happened, but suddenly my amazon app is unusable, and I‚Äôm not the only one having the same problem. First, whenever I try to do something on the app, it asks me for my password, then when I put it in, tells me ‚Äúsomething went wrong. Please try again later.‚Äù Then, I pick an item to order, hit ‚Äúproceed to checkout‚Äù, and after I select which address to ship to, the app just goes back to the main page and refuses to complete my order! I can‚Äôt order anything or do anything on this app!
Since the first of October pages don‚Äôt fully load or don‚Äôt load at all, and when they do and I‚Äôm able to shop I can‚Äôt check out! Always asking me for my password....
A glitch will kick you back to cart when you want to check out.
Feels like a bug: Enable Touch ID on ios devices DL Amz app. Login, enable touch ID. Next change your Amz password on a browser. (I have Prime). Now dont logout of Amz on your iOS devices. Check Orders > Use finger for TOuch ID.   Result: error message appears ‚Äú oops, something went wrong‚Äù  Logout/Login of apps. Re-enter new password.  Result: Unable to Touch ID. Exposes all Acct related menus.  Fix this Amazon...üßê 
I downloaded it because I was feeling lazy and didn‚Äôt want to type in my gift card code, and you‚Äôre supposed to be able to scan it on the app. Not only did that not work, even when browsing I can‚Äôt get through a page or two without it asking for my password and giving me an error (even though I‚Äôm already signed in) or it asking to enable Touch ID and then giving me an error. I deleted the app and am going back to the mobile browser, which is pretty well-designed and not nearly as buggy 
Every time I try to purchase from the app, I get message -‚Äúsorry, something went wrong.  Please try again.‚Äù  Have to always bring up within web browser to check out or looking up past orders.
So far the starting page is good has easy to navigate, but it does need some love in the comment section with better flow of people personal image been shown it feel so old trying to view them wish it would be more sliding and reading review of the image that was uploaded but the user.   Also if there can be a butting for same day pick up items that would be amazing. Yes there is prime button but that 2day shipping what if need it soon or something. But so far it‚Äôs good and I have any issues with the app. 
I tegularly get an error when trying to view my orders. The app will ask me to login with my password and them it just errors out.  Eventually it will work, but only after going back to home and trying again multiple times.
Was given the promotion of a $20 credit for my first app sign in. When I never got it, I went to the promo page and it said I wasn‚Äôt eligible. Not worth the memory space
App won‚Äôt let me sign in with thumb print nor with username & password, so I cannot check orders, etc.  It gives me a gray screen that does nothing.  App is VERY invasive privacy-wise, but that‚Äôs just Amazon for ya. 
The app won‚Äôt let me view pictures.  FRUSTRATING!!! 
It is extremely aggravating every time you want to sign or view details with thumbprint or username and password an error message comes up and says something went wrong. Somethings wrong alright, the second biggest retailer can‚Äôt fix a iPhone application...
I have Amazon Prime. I was expecting an item to arrive 2 days later, but instead I get a notification telling me something is wrong with my payment method, but when I go to change it, nothing is wrong with my card information! How are y‚Äôall gonna send me an extremely late notification AND be wrong about what you‚Äôre trying to tell me? If you noticed something was wrong you should have notified me as soon as the problem arose, not when my items were already scheduled to arrive.
I love amazon prime but with the latest update, I can‚Äôt view or track my orders in the app. I can only view/track when I log in on my laptop.   This has been a horrible experience given that I got all my gifts for the holidays from amazon. 
Since the last update, I can browse or search but if I try to check out, review orders, or otherwise need to enter my password it states, ‚ÄúSorry an error occurred...‚Äù or returns to the last screen I was viewing. If I want to do anything but browse or search, I have to close the app and login on with the Chrome app. Please fix this...
A pretty good app, but there are several glitches. It won‚Äôt let me change my payment method and it says ‚Äúerror‚Äù every time I try to log in. But yet, it logs me in... strange. There‚Äôs also a glitch with scrolling between the tabs, as others have stated.
Keeps asking for password every single time I try to checkout. Then it will give me an error. No face recognition either.
Any time another screen comes over the one you‚Äôre on (re-enter password, change shipping address), you can‚Äôt move any further in the flow. Once you tap on something on that screen that comes up, it just closes it and brings you back to the previous screen. Basically, you‚Äôre just stuck in a loop. Please fix this. I literally can‚Äôt buy anything through your app. I‚Äôm trying to give you money but you‚Äôre not letting me.
Keeps saying there‚Äôs an error preventing me from seeing my wish list or even place orders from mobile.
Amazon developers, use the iOS app and try to send a package to a new address.  Copy the address from iMessage and go from there.  Count the number of times you have to re-enter the address, number of times the shipping address switches back to yours and not the new address, and other hurdles along the way.  Please get basics right before venturing in to AR and other crazy stuff.
Everytime I try to place an order, the app asks me to log in. Then i get a message that says Oops! Something went wrong! And I can‚Äôt place the order. This happens on any screen where i need to view my account.  This issue makes the app pretty much useless.
I have looked and not found any way to report the bugs that render this app unusable.  I can only use the app for browsing, not for ordering.   I have to order through a web browser.  These issues have persisted for weeks/months. If i knew Amazon was aware of the bugs or was working on them, I would not have submitted this negative review.  Hopefully this will get their attention.  I enjoy shopping on Amazon, but cannot do so through this app.  If they would like to know, the main bugs are: - When asked to login to confirm password, it will say "oops something went wrong".  However if i continue doing what I'm trying to do it seems that it still recognized the login. - When checking out and trying to change the payment method or shipping address, whatever starts to happen disappears and nothing changes.  I am unable to continue with the order unless i use the current payment method and shipping. 
I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening but maybe it has something to do with ‚ÄúTouch ID‚Äù? Upon trying to check out amazon ask for me to log-in with the Touch ID that I‚Äôve used before. Then a message pops up saying that something went wrong and to try again later. This seems to happen all the time. Then the page continues to say ‚Äústill loading‚Äù after hitting ok. It‚Äôs very frustrating since it happens when I‚Äôm trying to check out.
It‚Äôs on by default. All the links that LOOK as if they‚Äôll allow me to disable it turn out to be dead ends in some way.
It keeps saying ‚Äúsomething went wrong‚Äù when I try to view my orders with either touch ID or my password. Fix this please
Once installed and fingerprint set up you never have to put in a password again. That may seem great, but I mean never even if you change the password or even the login email. You can still get in with a fingerprint. Even if someone gets a hold of your phone they can add a fingerprint and access all your orders and account info.
Checking out is a nightmare. Like going to the DMV   Requests that I re-enter my credit card every time I want to check out. Defeats the purpose of having the credit card on there. Half the addresses don‚Äôt work, and it doesn‚Äôt give you a suggested address that they deem is valid that is close to what you entered, like with other websites. On any of these two instances if you hit back... it‚Äôll take you to the checkout page which if you don‚Äôt watch carefully, it has your last ship to address selected instead of the new one you‚Äôre trying to enter.   Searching for shoes is a nightmare here too. Price advertised is never the true cost, so if you want to pick a range (for obvious budget purposes), you get a shoe that starts at that price, but never is actually that price, and then sizes are rarely available without completely changing the shoe. Doesn‚Äôt let you select a size and then a price, which would then narrow your search.   All in all, I might cancel my Prime if I keep having these basic problems when trying to shop here. 
Tried 5 times in a row. 3 times the "ship to this address" button took me back to the very first screen I get to when I tap on my cart without having saved the address that I just typed in. The other 2 times the button didn't do anything and I had to go back and start over. Going to have to dig up my laptop to make this order. Which year is this? :(
The app works well, but I don‚Äôt use it much because it doesn‚Äôt work with smile.amazon. This is a huge disappointment that prevents me from making the app my preferred way to use Amazon. Also, for security reasons, I would prefer to keep my credit card outside of Amazon and use Apple Pay. This would be a smart implementation.
You literally are not allowed to sign out. Want to use a separate account from your girlfriend so you can buy her a gift without her seeing it on your orders? Good luck.
What the heck?  Every time I use the app now, I‚Äôm prompted to sign in.  Who gives a crap about 1-click buy settings if you‚Äôre constantly bombarded with a prompt to re-enter your password at every turn.  It‚Äôs frustrating ‚Äî what used to be a great app has been seemingly ruined by useless added ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù and updates.
I can‚Äôt add anything to my wish list I can view my wish list. I honestly cannot view any other options on Amazon unless I‚Äôm buying something which is pointless in having the app if I still have to go online.  It‚Äôs always saying something went wrong Haven‚Äôt been able to use amazon in two months 
Trying to select different delivery address and app crashes or takes me back to login. Please fix.
Lately this app has been annoyingly glitchy. When trying to order a product and change the shipping address, it doesn‚Äôt let you and glitches back to the order screen. Also, when trying to view your orders it consistently asks me for the password and a pop up notification appears saying it is unavailable right now?   This app has worked great before. Please fix these issues. 
It‚Äôs been almost half an hour, and I still have been unable to sign out of the application.  This is a reprehensible design error; a total disregard of the customers ease-of-use.  R O-M, NJ. 
When accessing order history, continuously asks for password.  Can‚Äôt scroll through orders with password screen popping up, even after entering password
When I try to view orders, go to customer service, or do anything involving my own account on the app, I get the error box ‚ÄúSomething went wrong‚Äù. What is happening?
I used to love this app, now every time I try to shop from my phone or even look at old orders, it just asks me to enter my password (even tho I‚Äôm already logged in) and when I do, it says something went wrong. It‚Äôs literally only good for browsing and adding to my cart for later. Worthless.
Recent app updates have caused an endless cycle of forcing me to log in all the time, then giving me an error whenever I try to check out. App is rendered totally useless and has been for weeks.
Love this app! Just wanted to submit some feedback- the ‚ÄúAdd to List‚Äù function seems to have stopped working. Whenever I try to use it, it looks like the page just refreshes, and it takes me back to the top. 
This shows up everytime I am prompted to log in and can‚Äôt seem to use the app to notify me or even buy using it. Horrible!
Glitchy, kicks me out every time I try to change shipping address and everytime it asks for my password it glitches out as well. Piss poor app. Not what it used to be. Deleting and using the website instead
I love this app and use it frequently, but for the past 2 months or so, every time I try to sign in with the app, I get a pop up that says ‚ÄúSorry, something went wrong. Please try again.‚Äù and then I get a white screen. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating, please fix this!
Haven‚Äôt been able to look at my orders on this app in over a year and I can‚Äôt look at anything in my account other than my default wishlist. I have to use my mobile browser to Amazon which makes this app useless.
Everyone is giving this app bad reviews, I don‚Äôt know why. This app is amazing. Love shopping from it.
When it prompts for password for any changes in address etc it then reverts back to previous address etc. and loops over and over never making change. Now I log on and it won‚Äôt open ‚Äúorders‚Äù -just stays blank. Very obvious this app is overdue for an update on iOS.
After the last ‚Äòupgrade‚Äô I proceed to my basket I get the eternal log in demand - enter password, ‚Äòsomething went wrong‚Äô - back to basket - enter password, wash, rinse repeat!  Enough already!!!
I used this app religiously and now it wont even sign me into my account without and error message! I can‚Äôt buy anything because the checkout doesn‚Äôt work, I can‚Äôt check orders because it constantly asks for my password. From other reviews I see I‚Äôm not the only one having these issues! I don‚Äôt have these problems on my laptop!
I love shopping through Amazon, but the App won‚Äôt accept my password without a message ‚Äúsorry, something went wrong.‚Äù Won‚Äôt allow me to enter a new shipping address through the app. Won‚Äôt delete addresses from my address book either. Not helpful when traveling and I need things delivered to my hotel!
Developers, using the app to purchase or rent ebooks through the app doesn‚Äôt work. When you click the buy option I can select paperback and checkout but I can‚Äôt do so using ebooks.
When I search for something, say searching my orders list, and I go back to use the search again, the input field is highlighted but nothing I enter shows up in that field.
This last update totally broke my app - I cannot place an order nor view past orders. Right in time for me to go shopping elsewhere for the holidays.
As others have shared, the GIANT of companies can‚Äôt well make SMALL applications.  I‚Äôll want to change the shipping address, but it just runs a complete circle and gets me back to ‚Äòproceed to checkout‚Äô.  This also goes for any other option I choose on the ‚Äòproceed to checkout‚Äô page.
I LOVE Amazon & always shop online with them. I‚Äôve had great customer service & found great products & deals. I‚Äôm an Amazon Prime member.  BUT, the app is basically useless right now. It used to be very convenient, but I‚Äôm getting the same prompt to re-enter my password followed by the ‚Äúsomething went wrong‚Äù message. As soon as that is fixed, I will gladly change my rating to a 5 star to reflect the improvements.  Amazon, please help get this fixed! We need it for the holidays! 
The app won‚Äôt let me change my password and someone is hacking my account adding things to my cart. I called multiple times and had to recover my account. I‚Äôm tired of doing it, it‚Äôs annoying
Won‚Äôt allow me to view my account details or track orders. The app always defaults to the log in page when I‚Äôm already logged in. It will let me shop, but not view my account info or my orders.  It‚Äôs annoying to have to use Amazon in my browser now when I have the app but that‚Äôs what I do now. Deleting until fixed. 
Every time I try to sign in to view my orders I get an oops something went wrong error. So frustrating!!!!!
I have used this app for a long time and its been great until now all the sudden, whenever i put items in my cart and go to checkout whenever im selecting shipping options for the last item in my cart say i have 10 items in the cart and it will stop on the 10th one and keep showing the same 10th item everytime i click proceed forward so I cant purchase any items in my cart and this mobile app is messed up now. Perfect timing with the holidays coming up for Amazon app not to work...
Can‚Äôt enter my password or change it however I can make purchases without needing this information?!?!?!? Can‚Äôt even access customer support or track my packages cause all that needs a password but purchasing doesn‚Äôt...
I tried shopping on amazon for a change bought something and still a month later it never came worst website out there
This is the message I get every time I try to look at ‚Äò your orders ‚Äò.  Using the fingerprint verification doesn‚Äôt work. I have to enter my password using the keyboard each time. Please fix the app so it is useful in reviewing past orders.
This app can‚Äôt get any better! I absolutely love everything you can but on here and I mean anything. It‚Äôs such a simple app to use and it can save you more money than actually going to the store.
Normally a great app, but it keeps crashing sometimes when I log in, try to check out, or change an address. Impossible for me to buy anything at the moment
Normally I love this app but since the last update it constantly asks for my password and tells me something went wrong! It won‚Äôt let me finish reviewing what I am trying to review because it kicks me out of that screw repeatedly. Please fix it!
One star. I am deleting the app as soon as this review is complete. Way inferior to the browser view for purchasing & research, but what has sent me over the edge is the vibration whenever an item is added to the cart. According to Amazon support this cannot be disabled in the app. Just use a browser.
Glitches when I try to view my orders, glitches when I try to change my shipping address, glitches when I try to change my payment method, glitches when I try to add a new payment method. If I log out and try to log back in it just keeps saying "something went wrong."

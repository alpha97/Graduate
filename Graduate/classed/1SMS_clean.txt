Up until the latest update on or about 24 April this would have been 5-stars but it doesn't seem to be working any longer. I really feel like it should be just one-star at the moment but it's been so good up until now. I am hoping that whatever the problem is that it sorts itself out. If so, I will add two more stars.
I have used this app fairly happily for years and despite occasional glitches it has mostly gotten the job done. However since the last update it is refusing to back up certain messages (especially the first 6-7 of the day, there doesn't seem to be any pattern).
I like it. But I always have to do the back up even though I checked to have it done automatically. And it used to not no more my conversations on my end. Now is only the other persons conversation not mine too. How can I add my conversation? Not backup the other person's conversation.
Lol. Let me get this straight: in order to use this app, I have to grant you permission to read all my emails? Why do you need access to my emails for an app that backs up text messages? You don't. It sucks for those who gave you guys permission to creep through their private conversations - they learned nothing from Facebook.
I have been using (and referring) this app for several years, but noticed several months ago that it is not automatically syncing any longer. I have to set a reminder on my calendar to manually go into app and sync it.

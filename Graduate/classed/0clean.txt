You can no longer view buyer/seller messages, or other messages for that matter. I just went through every menu item and there are nowhere to be found! How stupid is that? Argh!! Bring it back!!!
App now (for some reason) now has a bar at the top showing my name and address!!! Why?!?!? Cant get rid of it and don't want anyone seeing it! Please get rid of this terrible feature!!!!!
Amazon what are you doing? Who’s in charge over there? I can’t seem to search my lists anymore!
I have prime membership and every time I order something they tell me my order is being delayed. I call customer service to find out why and I get a huge run around and a bunch of excuses of why and not one of them make any sense. They tell me it might say 2 day but that’s not true and they ship it however the fulfillment center wants to no matter if 2 day overnight or what ever shipping someone pics. I will not recommend amazon or this app to anyone.
So I bought this 100$ gift card , can’t buy anything with it , so i contact their customer service to see want’ going on , and they said I HAD TO WAIT 2 DAYS AND HAD TO WASTE MY TIME TO FAX THE RECEIPT TO THEM JUST SO IS “SAFE” OH COME ON! NOW MY DEAL FOR MY ITEM IS GONE AND I WASTED 2 DAYS !!!
You guys should take Apple Pay, it’s a good app I’ve been using it for almost 2 years but I just want guys take Apple Pay
Using this app on my iPad Pro - doesn’t look ANYTHING like the pictures in the app preview.  Typical crappy Amazon software release discipline - release notes are non-descriptive and don’t indicate what’s been changed.  Come on Amazon - you employ half of the town I live in - can’t you get a simple mobile app correct for customers who spend tens of thousands of dollars with you a year?    One NICE thing - at least landscape mode works again.  Wow. 
If I order something in the morning and later on decide to order more things the system crashes once I get to the payment portal
Why pay $100 a year for 2-day shipping when it’s a gamble whether or not you actually receive 2-day shipping? If it’s not going to ship in the amount of time that you pay for, why not just disclose that! I am incredibly irritated, as I ordered something Thursday only because the app claimed it would be here yesterday. I NEEDED a broken piece of my breast pump for work today. If I had known it wouldn’t arrive till the FOLLOWING WEEK (even though the item advertised WILL ARRIVE BY SATURDAY), I would have just spent the extra money and bought it at the store when I had the chance. However, I had no updates saying the order would be late. I returned home last night with no order and the tracking says it won’t arrive till next week. I am currently at work in a lot of pain because my pump will not work without it. See if I pay for my membership next time around!
I’ve been an Amazon Prime for years. I use this app all day, every day; just because I’m addictive to it; but lately, most of the time I add an item to my cart, I get this error message that says “Amazon encountered a problem”. That’s the only reason I took a star away. LOVE AMAZON ❤️❤️❤️
Unfortunately I have never experienced a time using Amazon when searching for specific product that the search return the filtered products or results that were accurate.  When Using filters, the filters do not filter with accuracy, the worst part is regardless of what you search or filter the results do not provide only the selected product filtered or for that matter a complete category products offered My experience with Amazon is they are notorious for including irrelevant products into your search.    The style of coding creates a complete waste of consumers time and inhibits their customers from actually purchasing the desired products, adding to the company’s bottom line.    ** If Amazon believes providing irrelevant, meaningless, or inaccurate product results when searching or filtering they are seriously mistaken! **  This actually creates the opposite effect and does a disservice to their loyal customers. If this is what the Product and Marketing Owners call convenience, they ought to step back and reevaluate their tactics. These tactics force the consumer to reevaluate shopping with Amazon and return to brick-and-mortar.    Be the industry leader, then follower and STEP UP and change the industry standard and provide consumers with accurate and effective process to locate relevant merchandise. 
Prime shipping is rarely delivered 2 day shipping any more. Customer service has promised my a $30 credit twice because of week overdue orders and never fulfilled they’re promise. Amazon Primevis not what it used to be.
Amazon raised PRIME withholding all explanations for unrealistic increases to their customers....Bad Plan  SHIPPING WITH FedEx... Strike TWO! FedEx under investigation for ILLEGAL SHIPPING OF SHARKFIN DOLPHINS ORCA et.al..  TRACKING feature has now been disabled vs before which DIRECTLY LINKED US TO OFFICIAL SHIPPERS TRACKING WEBSITE  ...fin....  Failure in all aspects of operations testing combined with;  Unwillingness to adhere to: ‘the NUMBER 1 Rule of Business’, will result in Amazon being Bankrupt by JUNE 2018. DrDi 
Amazon’s customer service and the way they handle their business is the best I’ve ever encountered.
Nice app and easier to use than a website on my ipad, however it would be much better if I could order my Kindle books as well!  I can order and pay for any thing except books. WHY?
I’ve been a prime member for a while now and just today i cancel it cause its crap. My orders never on time as they claim the 2-day delivery and its always late. Every-time i call customer service they just say sorry and they will look into it. So if you think Amazon is fast. Think again.
How come on this app most of the items won’t inform me if it fits my vehicle like dash screens
I stared using Amazon for shopping only recently but have truly been delighted with both the selection and prices.  Their shipping is reasonable and gets there fairly close to expected times. I am very happy with this company.
3rd party international sellers should be separated from domestic sellers. They are a pain to deal with and the customer shouldn’t even have to question whether they are purchasing from an international seller unless they navigate to a section that clearly states international 3rd party. I’m sure amazon customer service spend unneeded time to get things resolved with these sellers.
Sorting by low to high price doesn’t work right forcing you to scroll thru hundreds of items. Who has the time for such nonsense?
For a company that does trillions of dollars in business in the US they can't provide customer service reps that speak coherent English.
I was guaranteed delivery by 8pm today. Amazon said it was delivered at my door when it was not. I’ve been home so I would have seen it. Checked with my neighbors and no package. Can’t request a refund until tomorrow at 4pm. What’s the point of Amazon Prime?
Amazon has really bad customer service the supervisor Pau is the worst customer customer person they have. Don’t have a clue what Customer service mean. Fix the problem don’t make it worse for the customer. It need to get fired. To the CEO of the company need to get of  Pau from Customer service supervisor in Amazon. Want to bring your rating up start with that person in customer service supervisor Pau
I’ve been using amazon for a while and it was great with prime deliveries, but now 75% of the time I’m supposed to get my package within 2-3 days, it gets delayed another week.
I use amazon a lot, I really mean a LOT. With that said prime has let me down a lot too, getting worse too. Forget the delivery date they give you, missing more and more of those target dates lately. And while we are at it did you realize that some bad reviews on products they will not let you post, like getting obviously used poorly repackaged items sold as new???? Yea tried to post that twice and they wouldn’t let me warn others. Overall I’m seen using them, just highly disappointed in their delivery promises and their unwillingness to post negative reviews. 
Abysmal!!! Worst app I’ve had to use by a great company I just don’t get it. I just ordered something and it doesn’t take and I can’t see them in “Your Orders” but I get an email for them?
Can you please make a filter for items that you don’t have a prime membership for? I would shop Amazon like a mad man if I didn’t have to pay for a membership... 
Come on- just get the app steady and functional! It would be fantastic if the list function actually worked. It would be great if deleting and adding and creating new lists actually worked.
Application is good, works well and easy to use. But i want an option to choose what shipping carrier service i want to use: FedEx is better for my country and UPS is the worst one, DHL is average and usually give me some trouble and so on. In this case, i prefer to use FedEx but there is no choice.  There is also one problem: users cannot use “Contact Us” menu from the application to chat to customer service (must be done through desktop computer).  Thanks 
I’ve recently placed a couple orders these past few months and I am a prime member. I pay the extra couple bucks for one day shipping and the package never comes what is the point of next day shipping if they never deliver on time?
THREE times now, I’ve ordered something from amazon to arrive at my school in Nashville but for some reason, Amazon keeps thinking I’m sending it to my house in Maine. I explicitly choose my Nashville address every time but regardless it arrives in Maine 2 days later. Im so freaking tired of this.
Annoying issue where you’ll search for something and it’ll say “no results.” This occurs when searching for non-brand name items. Quite frustrating.
I got a new I phone. And tried to access my Amazon account. Could not do it, and the only me option available to was to set up a new account which I did. That gave me access to service or I should say nonservice. This should be a no brained.  My full name is unique as due to family name change I'm the only one on planet Earth.  One man added a second "S" in 1792. With the use of my updated genealogy I can find any Sharpless in existence. There are three Stephen's, but only one with the middle initial "H". DO AN ALPHA SEARCH AND RESTORE MY ACCOUNT
I purchased a 23 and me dna kit from an amazon seller for $156 and after sending my sample to the 23 and me company they emailed me to let me know my sample kit had been destroyed because it was originally purchased from the 23 and me web site with a stolen credit card by the amazon seller who then sold the kit to me, I reported it immediately to amazon and they found that it was not their fault that a seller that they backed had sold me a $156 useless product and thus I wasn’t due any money back, I was cheated by the seller and amazon, cheated out of hard earned money because they allowed a seller to sell stolen items, so BUYERS BEWARE OF AMAZON AND THEIR FAULTY A TO Z CHEAT PEOPLE OUT OF MONEY GUARANTEE
I used to be able to swipe between credit card options for 1-Click purchases on the item page which was terrific and convenient. I now have to go to my account options and select between my saved credit cards, save my choice for 1-click purchases and then go back to the item page and use 1-click. I use different credit cards depending on what I’m purchasing. Why do I have to jump through hoops to use 1-click???
If u need it "fine-fast-& foolproof" AMAZON is ur  #1 "GO TO" guy!  Their quality vendors, impeccable merchandise & services, & ultra-speedy delivery r 2nd to NO ONE. My brother, BRADFORD, is often referred to as the "AMAZON KING." Thank U Amazon 4 being THE BEST.
It’s amazon. It’s fine. You can buy anything and the government subsidizes each package to the tune of $1.47 or some such thing. We all know this.   My issues are these:   1. You can’t delete items in your order history. Yes I know you can hide them. So what. When you go to write a review the item appears again. I don’t need amazon or anyone else remembering everything I have purchased over my entire lifetime. Drop it after 30 days or some such thing OR at least give us an option. “Check this box to permanently delete this order. You understand doing so means you cannot return anything and all reviews associated with this order will be lost.” If I have had a product for 2 years and the warranty was 90 days why do I need it in my history if I don’t want it there? It is my account let me manage it.    2. What is going on with prices? I’m finding lower prices elsewhere online and even locally. That used to be a rare thing. 
They pretend to be this great company with donations to the non-profit of your choice. If you use this App nothing you purchase benefits the nonprofit you have registered.  Seems slimy 
The amazon app used to be a wonderful thing. I am not a “prime” member and I have been seeing a lot of issues with that. I feel like amazon is trying to force me into a membership. I have come across several items that I couldn’t buy because I wasn’t a “prime” member. I have also placed several orders in the last couple of months that have either never showed up or the delivery date has been pushed back by another week. This is starting to occur more and more often. I am disappointed in the way amazon is treating non “prime” members.
I ordered some pre-workout mixes purely because it was on sale for one day only. Then my package got lost. I understand, not Amazon’s fault and I’m not upset that it got lost. But my only option is to now get a refund. I don’t want a refund!! I want my items but now to get it would have to pay 40% more. Terrible service.
App stinks. They can update all they want, it doesn't help since SERVICE continues to go downhill. 4th time this year alone we've not received our guaranteed shipment as prime members. Great idea of having your own delivery service Amazon, & hiring dependable workers, working real well.  NOT! Customer service chat is so clueless, so useless & an absolute waste of time.   Another update, another issue. Now can NOT add anything to my cart! Errr! Says to select a size when a size is already selected & reselected!! What next.  Search suuucks! Type in a SPECIFIC item & get over 1,000 results - 90% which have NOTHING to do with my specific search. C'mon apply search intelligence!  Please fix the scrolling issues once again! It lags & lags! Get RID of the recommendations & what others bought - who cares?!! Hate that.  Read your feedback Amazon! Annoying that I Can NOT even see my full cart & what I have in it, will not scroll all the way down.  Get constant error codes. Oh & customer service chat - terrible! terrible service! Train your people better! 
Guaranteed delivery times seem to have no meaning whatsoever. It’s like there’s no guarantee whatsoever. App freezes a lot. Customer service slow.
You could use amazon to get things instead of going to the store. It’s just shopping from home. If you love shopping like me you have to get this app!! except my little sister once ordered a fingerling (a tiny monkey toy that plays on your finger) and when it came it had a red glowing light on the stomach  and looked like a McDonald’s toy so my mom called and they gave her her money back so you’re probably going to want to see what your getting.  P.S - my sister finally got a fingerling for Christmas. 
Shop here everyday! Great app great company!!! #PrimeMember
Amazon no longer has free return shipping? Their prices also aren't the cheapest. There really in no incentive to shop on Amazon vs other major retailers. If I buy a product I don't like, depending on the price, I lose more then half my investment if I want to return it. Even if the product is damaged, I still have to pay return shipping. You also never know exactly what your going to get from the picture/description. I've always praised their customer service but in past months they have been willing to help. Products I have ordered from them have arrived damaged, late, or not shown up at all. I no longer associate the Amazon brand with good customer service, low prices, or efficiently.
Too many one click order buttons!I made a few orders which I did not intended to, because I clicked the buttons by mistake, or I didn’t know it would lead to an actual order without any further confirmation. I did not know I placed the orders until I tried to check my other orders’ statues, and sometimes it’s too late to cancel the wrong order
The product is good is the price I was not to happy, these 2 items I brought was $45 and changed it up to $59 no, I’m not going to buy amazon again! Plus it was a free shipping and it’s not a free shipping, not going to shop there again.
Amazon. I love your shopping choice. However I pay you every year to be a prime member for 2 day free shipping. And recently this has been hit or miss. I have a message saying if I order in the next 14 hours I get it by x day (2 days from now) and half the time now I don’t get it by x day. I’m lucky to get it a day after that. And I don’t live out in the middle of no where. I live in a decently populated area. So for that I am rating them and their app a 3 star because the choice is awesome. But it lies to me... :/
Tried to buy a pair of shoes. Amazon has added new sizing help, but you can’t actually choose a size. Keeps popping up an error “need to select a size” even though I have. So it’s impossible to buy a pair of shoes. Amazon’s loss. I bought from another store. This is a bummer because I literally turn to Amazon first.
I had a problem with connecting to internet but seems like its apple id issue. Love the 2 day shipping.
I can’t review products unless I spend $50 on a valid credit/debit card? Gift cards and my amazon store card (that I’ve had for 8 years doesn’t count)? This is THE dumbest thing I’ve ever heard of. I should be able to share my opinion about products no matter how I purchased them!!
This used to be reliable but lately it’s buggy. Search results take forever to load and error messages pop up frequently. I’d never shop at amazon if I had to rely on this app and this experience is leaving a bad taste so that I don’t want to seek out alternative ways to buy from amazon. I can get what I’m looking for from target or bed bath and beyond. The app was part of the convenience. Without that why bother?
all versions didn’t show the full price with tax and shipping costs on the last step  i talked to customer service and they told that i’m right and we will fix the issue   still now not fix 
I spent waiting for my phone calls twice over 2 hours. I asked for phone call now. Disgusted I used the chat room and got the best service ever. Resolved my problem in ten minutes. I’m going to use them from now on. The letter from amazon was too long and sorry was not enough.
Got ahold of one person was told I was getting a refund for a shirt I never received. Got an email the next day explaining my refund and how it would take 3-5 business days for it to show in my account. They filed a claim for something I haven’t even opened yet. Then I message customer service and explain I’m getting refunded for the wrong things-not fair to that company to take a hit-and the customer service person tells me it’s a “third party” problem and he’s sending me a link to file a claim. I tell him he needs to take care of it, it’s their responsibility. Low and behold in the email it says to get ahold of Amazon’s customer service department for help to file the claim. Very poor customer service for people who order off of amazon all the time
Hi there a strange behavior on Amazon app when I want to view the shipping thing information some normal select and not normal view and there a video demo that have problem when I click play arrow and went back to home view and I keep try click and it went back to original home on app weird behavior please fix that situation ASAP thanks
The CALL ME feature loops and starts over vs initiate a call. Your artificial intelligence on chat can not understand call me. It also does NOT recognize a phone number when it asks for a number.  Your app turned on Prime Pantry... I did NOT.  As a consequence I cannot place an order because it wants me to order hundreds for a grocery order, I guess. Your app pops a welcome line at the top of the page. This drops the app down the page. You cannot scroll down to CUSTOMER SERVICE, because it is now off the screen because your app places a welcome message at the top.
Considering its an app from one of the biggest companies, it’s pathetic.  Only button works 100% without fail is ‘buy’. The rest, only works when it feels like it.
The latest update’s call me now button doesn’t work. Every time I click it, it just keeps looping back to the selection of questions as to why I am calling. Very irritating!
They routinely take your money, send you empty boxes or the wrong thing, and then leave the ball in your court to print stuff and return it just to get your money back. Zero help. They are diliberate lay unhelpful in hopes you will give up and let them keep your money. Happens all the time.
I’ve never written a review here on the App Store but I just wanted to say that whoever came up with the idea to add a little map in ‘track your package’ and give you real-time updates on your delivery is a genius. Best feature ever!
The new format is okay with one exception...NO MORE BROWSING HISTORY!!! I’m a 60 year old person that more and more often need to be reminded of the things that inspire me. With no option to look at my long time history, I find that my purchasing intentions are severely blocked. BRING BACK THE HISTORY OPTIONS!!!
I do not like that you have to pay for shipping the item back I had to pay $6.00 for shipping it back and that’s exactly what I paid for it so what’s the whole point on returning something if u DO NOT like either way your not getting your whole money back and before it used to be free to return something back but now I DO NOT LIKE AMAZON because of that reason now I am not getting my money back because that’s what it costs for shipping 😡😡😡☹️☹️
Purchased something with prime membership, selected the two day prime membership shipping, received the package four days later. Cancelling prime.
Amazon has been horrible to me! This app has been a nightmare!  I have been removed for “unexplained “ violations or breaking “community guidelines “ that NO ONE FROM AMAZON can seem to explain....  They also pulled over 1/2 of my reviews...  Thanks Amazon! 
All of my orders so far have been delivered as promised and in optimal condition. For the 1st time the other day I reached out to Amazon online re. a question/concern. Rep answered immediately via chat, solved my issue, and was very professional and courteous. Definitely more pleasant than some of my “in store” shopping experiences!!
(January 30th 2018 i’am adding to this review)  IAM DONE BUYING FROM THEM! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE Amazon gave me a fake tracking number for my package, lied about it when I emailed them, took a month to receive the item, fake tracking on the package doesn’t say who it came from AND VERY SHADY THAT I CANT MESSAGE THE SELLER!  Amazon always removes my reviews that are less than 4 or 5 stars or hides them when they are verified! so you cant see the real reviews, it’s NOW January 26th 2018 still cannot write a review for a product I PAID for they only “approve” reviews that are 4/5 stars and the ones that are paid “I got sent this product for free” = 5 star review 
I have always used and enjoyed the Amazon app and spend thousands of $$$ each day year...until now! Thanks to the horrible “enhancements” in this latest update, I can no longer select product options from drop down lists (like color, size, etc) nor can I zoom in on most product photos like I could just last week. All from my iPad, just as I had always done before - but now you’ve rendered the app useless to me. What the heck, Amazon?!?!
Order tracking seems glitchy two items I ordered have been delivered to my house and I have them but amazon says they are still being shipped and two of my orders that are being shipped haven’t had the tracking updated for five days which is weird I mean that’s basically saying it’s gone nowhere in five days
Overall this is a great app, easy to navigate, search, etc. I would give it 5 stars buuuuuuut......With that said I couldn’t tell you how many times I’ve accidentally hit the buy now button and am left scrambling to cancel the order.  Not to mention it doesn’t show up in the cart that you even clicked on it in the first place. PLEASE FIX THIS AMAZON!!
Need someone to talk or email someone. Can’t sign in
First let me say that being a Prime Member is by far the best part of Amazon. Besides getting two day deliveries and watching Prime Movies these two things is what keeps me coming back to the Amazon App.   Now for the downside. I have the IPhone 7 Plus and the last few months I noticed a #1 in a Red Circle which is very noticeable when you are looking at your phone. I called Amazon Customer Service and spoke with their technicians but all they can tell me was to delete the app and reinstall it. I did just that and even shut my phone off to reboot the phone and when I went to the App Store I reinstalled the Amazon App and the #1 is still there.   If anyone who reads this thinks they know what this might be please get in touch with me.   Picture this, when you have new mail or on Facebook if you have new Messages you will have a # on your App. This is what I have on the Amazon App.   Thank you Howard Krulik 
They don’t let you post real ratings on their products and service... they use too but not anymore... their 5 and 4 star products ratings don’t mean anything
When I called to get an explanation I got circular arguments that made no sense and unfortunately turned a 5 star app into trash.
The tracking info is very on-point and is very accurate! Most of the time it arrives earlier than expected!
New format is a step in the wrong direction
Same day delivery is such a marketing sham . I have never got the stuff delivered on the same day inspite of so many attempts  It’s 2018 and your app still looks so old. It works all the time and that is it . 
So my mail carrier is awful (USPS) and they lost my most recent package, they showed it as delivered but it never arrived, I waited 2 days and it still never showed. So I sent an email to amazon customer service and they were very quick to respond with an apology email (not their fault what happened) and within 3 hours I had the refund in my checking, I switched to amazon prime where they use ups for the 2 day shipping. Great customer service!
Please put the app back the way it was; this is awful!
Hands down Amazon is my favorite app on my phone. I am browsing on amazon or making a purchase at least 4 days a week. I love that I can efficiently find what I’m looking for and receive it the next day! Amazon is hands down my favorite place to shop! Their customer service is impeccable! They are kind, funny and most importantly AMAZING at their jobs!
Each iteration of the iPad Amazon app is increasingly less user-friendly than the proceeding version. Time to hire a professional dev company to take over for you. Your in-house dev staff are most likely being bribed by competitors.
I don’t know what the problem is with your app, but I can’t order ANYTHING. How is there an error every time I try to place an order on your app, but I can go online and place the order no problem? Really makes me want to not renew my subscription with Amazon or Prime....
Doesn’t send notifications about delivery status like it says it would.
The new update doesn’t let me filter the search by price ranges anymore. Before i could search for products between a certain price ranger ie “$10-$15” or “$20-$25” And so forth, but the new update doesn’t even give me that option. I have to sort products from low high now, but the app for some reason takes out a bunch of products when I sort by anything other than “relevance.” Like if there are 300 products, and I decide to sort by price or rating or anything other than relevance, then suddenly there are 120. I don’t know why it takes out a lot of the products, but it does.   Another thing I want changed is the recommendations. It used to have the \"not interested/I already own it\" feature on there. That made it easier for me to see anything I was actually interested in but now that it\'s gone, a lot of items I show no interest in are showing up and I can\'t make them go away. Like some of those things are showing up because someone else (a friend or family member) searched something on my account to see how much it would cost. So if that feature was back, I could get rid of the items that show up in my recommendations and see stuff that I want and be more likely to buy things considering, you know, I’d ACTUALLY see what I wanted. 
I love the app, never had any problems. I’m on amazon all the time. But I have to give a special shout out to the delivery peeps lately!! My last few packages have been concealed for me!! One behind a potted plant and another under the front door mat. Not to mention the delivery photos just to verify, I love it! Gotta keep loving me some Amazon!!!
I love Amazon, I’m a diehard Apple user and Alexa is one of the few non-Apple devices I rely on. I’m a prime member and a dedicated Amazon user and supporter BUT this is the first time I’ve had a complaint. I’m already paying for prime membership do I really have to have these pop-ups like wish list tray?  I hated it when Amazon merged with audible.com and I still do but I bit the bullet and try to make it work but changes aren’t always a good thing. Sometimes I think the programmers get bored and right code so they won’t lose their jobs. The simplicity is slowly fading, there’s 3000 different kinds of prime memberships. Who can keep them all straight? And why should I have to work that hard? Apparently some of them are only for certain geographical locations. If that’s true, don’t show me the ones that don’t apply to my area. You have my address, Amazon.  Worst of all, since ios 11.2 the app freezes Constantly. I have to quit and re-launch about four times a day. Yes, my iphone 6s+ is a few years old. I’ve been too lazy to go into the store to upgrade but it’s not that because this is the only app I have to constantly re-launch. Could it be that you’re putting too many pop-ups and wish list trays into the app, Amazon? Stop. It’s stressful enough spending money don’t over complicate it. Anybody can be replaced. Don’t turn your back on the features that made you popular, ease of use. Goodbye 
This app is terrible I ordered a package they was supposed to come on the 22 and it was a week late. Horrible app, and it’s also very slow
I don’t understand why Amazon only has 3 stars, it deserves at least 4. (I give it a 5). If you’re a student, it’s only 50 dollars a year. You cannot beat that. Free 2 day shipping from soooo many sellers, and competitive and affordable prices. Even 100 dollars a year is reasonable too. They offer incentives for choosing normal shipping, like 5 dollars towards amazon fresh(their supermarket app) or 1 dollars towards electronics(or clothes, etc.). I ordered my books for school and was offered free one day shipping at checkout. It would’ve cost me 300 dollars to buy the books, but I only payed 60 dollars by renting them.  What a relief. Thanks girl
I get email specials from Amazon telling me a $50 item is on sale for 19.99.  They tell me it’s 70% off regular price but that regular price they quote is a lie.  Look around. You won’t find the MLMSY travel makeup bag anywhere for $50.  It’s always around $20.  So why does Amazon inflate a price to tell me they are discounting it ?  Very misleading.  Class-action lawsuit type activity.  Price fixing and mis-representing prices so you think your getting a deal
I signed up for amazon prime for the year for $99 as advertised but instead of doing what I simply asked for they deny me yearly membership without cause and decide to charge my account $130 a year instead of the advertised $99 a year. When I asked for them to fix it, all I get told is you can cancel your account and that’s all we can do for you? Like what?! Talk about good customer service... yeah NEVER again will I bother with Amazon
When you scroll down the deals, images disappear for a moment and reappear after some 3-4 sec. That continuously happens as long as you scroll! Not an expect from Amazon! 
Advertised shipping is often incorrect and takes much longer. Costumer service is not like it was and now play around with you. You guys play stupid, playing stupid games not at all what Amazon was in the beginning
They delivered my stuff in the wrong mailbox 3 times and I don't even get a refund for their mistake
Amazon is not what is use to be. Shipping is longer than 2 days and even takes forever to ship. Had packages missing and arrive late past guaranteed time. Not worth paying prime membership and would rather watch movies on Netflix instead of amazon. Save your money and troubles and use target never had a problem with shipping and u don’t have to buy a membership for crappy shipping!
I have been waiting for the gear fidget spinner ever since March and I never got it yet and we lost some money for nothing.😡
Customer service trash. I gave amazon my address to ship directly to my house and for odd reason they sent it to another address. Bought the wrong part for my car cause it said it fit on my mustang. Bought an Alternator through amazon and it never work. And that wasn’t the last. I filed probably over 10 complaints last year and and non of them could speak English at all but the supervisor. I would never recommend nobody to amazon cause they trash overall
Apparently Amazon has decided we, the buyer, don’t count anymore. I had a hard time with the last order I placed - what should have been a simple book order turned into a pain in the butt. When I contacted the seller, they told me they would put a tracker on the package - which would have been wonderful, EXCEPT it was several more days before the package even shipped! Now, I would much prefer the TRUTH (something like “we haven’t shipped it, but we’ll still get it there by the date we said we would”) to a bald face LIE. And, personally, I’d like to warn other potential buyers. I think what some sellers are doing (probably even the one I dealt with) is they log the weigh bill into the USPS system as “this is where it’s gonna go - WHEN we get it to you,” but then don’t get it ready and send it for several days after that. Meanwhile, the customer gets all excited (wow, look at how fast they ship!), and it artificially inflates the seller’s response time. AMAZON - there should be some way you can track this sort of thing. I never did get a form to rate my order or the seller (not in the app, nor in the email), and my order took every single day possible - just barely squeaking in under the wire for “date promised.” And after having sent a request through YOU to the seller (for tracking), I would absolutely think you’d follow that up. So much for customer service.
This rating applies to Amazon’s mp3 purchases only:  Keep a thorough record of your mp3 purchases, because you’ll need it. Amazon mysteriously deletes tracks from your cloud, but doesn’t tell you. When you call customer service to see what happened, they’re more than happy to refund your account so you can go back in a repurchase them, but there missing the point: They shouldn’t be deleting the tracks in the first place, and since they deleted them, THEY should be the ones adding them back. 
I just want to but food. But i dont want to be freanking SCAMMED with the bs 14.99 amazon pantry. I was used to be able to but regularly withput this hassle but i am very dissatisfaction
Used to love Amazon and being Prime member was worth it. Now with every update they take a little or a lot more songs etc away. Just feels like you are getting cheated with every update with the guise of fixing something lol. Guess not making enough money eh? 😂
Outstanding customer service and care. Good prices and super fast free delivery! THANKS! 
I bought two different products at different times from different companies. Amazon send emails both times with delays for sending it to the incorrect carrier facility. My package is 8 days overdue! Terrible service and waste of money.
Amazon is nothing more than a rip-off they think they can just take whatever money they want from you and say you authorize a purchase please nothing more than thieves the whole company is one of the biggest scams on the planet
I had an issue on an order and there customer service resolved it in under a minute.
This app is the best for suff you want to be delivered to you instead of you having to buy it in the store.
You need to make the colors of the “add to cart” and the “one-click purchase” buttons much more different. I accidentally made a $114 purchase because of this problem. I thought I closed it before it completely loaded the page but it went through anyways. Amazon was really good a quickly responding to my refund request so that’s why I gave it 4 stars but they lost the 5th star based on the button problem.
returned this book and they won’t refund me the money for it. I’ve removed confirmation emails and tracking info for the item. Every time I talk to anyone about the situation they are extremely rude and are no help at all. Even though I have received emails from them stating the items been received they say that there is no records of me returning the items. The computer is crooked and quick to take money from my account but when the item has been returned they want to act like they can’t find the order or any history of me returning the book
Everyday if I open the app my cart is full of junk items (phone cases for phones that neither I nor anyone in my family has) that I would never even think of buying or looking at! I delete them but different ones get added the next day! I won’t open the app for a week and when I do it’s full of junk. It’s very creepy and I feel violated. The app is the only way I access my amazon account. I’ve changed my password multiple times but it doesn’t matter. I know my account hasn’t been hacked as no orders ever go through so it seems amazon is purposely placing these items in my cart hoping I’ll accidentally buy them! Very very shady practice. I may end up canceling prime if this continues.
Spend your money elsewhere. I have Prime membership for the two day shipping. I had an order that was supposed to be delivered within two days; latest day being Sunday (today when I’m writing this). Today was the second day and the deliverer just passed my house. I got a notification from Amazon saying attempt failed, but he didn’t even stop at my house! So there goes my two day shipping that I pay extra for. Customer service was no help and the best they could do was have it shipped tomorrow. I wish they would have compensated me for this inconvenience. But they were no help. Not worth giving them my money.
My order sits for a week before actually shipping and it’s never two day shipping. If your going to send it snail-mail at least get it out the door faster!
Two day delivery is a joke. They should just call it expedited delivery and not promise two days because it hardly happens. Several orders I’ve made have taken 4 to 5 days when they’re prime promised 2 day. Right now I’m waiting on something I ordered Wednesday that originally said I would get it Sunday but now it’s saying Monday. It’s nice to get things quicker, but don’t count on it. If you need something by a certain date order it at least a week in advance.
Need a link to pay bill
So far a little but right after Christmas I ordered an item for two of my friends for it to say they would arrive Jan. 8.  But then 5 minutes after the orders disappeared and I did it again, and again, and again.  I waited to get to the house I’m moving in before I bought them something, I found out that amazon has been canceling my orders and I’m just asking why?  Thanks and hope for the fix
It's kind of a shell of an app.  It looks great. Does some basic things well, like loading pages, letting users make use of lists, etc... but the purchasing process is non functional.  Right before Christmas I put a few things in my cart that were "deal of the day". A couple of the items were very time sensitive.  I proceeded to the purchase part of the process and wound up on an endless loop of having to log in - over and over again.    After doing this repeatedly I still had time to purchase these time sensitive items, so I hustled and downloaded the app update. It wasn't updated... that had to be the problem, right?    Wrong.  Not to sound too dramatic here, but I, literally, stood outside in -9° because I was out shopping when this snafu was happening and I'd lose my signal inside the store I was heading into.  At any rate, the download finished, the application malfunction was not remedied.  I contacted online support, explained my problem of what happened, and their stellar customer support response was "so what is it you want me to do for you?".  Uhmmm... yah... Nothing, Amazon.  Do nothing.  I'll buy my Christmas gifts while I'm out today. I'm sure you're not losing any sleep over my, or anyone else's, consumer experience. Thanks. 🙄 
I never thought I’d like shopping on line,but amazon has made it pretty easy even for a non techy person like myself lol but it would be nice if they would automatically send a return label with purchases in case the item needs returning. But at least ya don’t have to pay shipping just take it to ups store and they do charge for a label under$2.00 but I don’t return to many items just the ones that I change my mind with.like wrong size...etc have fun shopping the Amazon
Amazon your review system is one of the main reasons I use your services! Now every time I look for an item I have some stupid Chinese POS with a high number of 5 star reviews by reviewers who only leave 5 star reviews and often they do it all on the same exact day. Amazon, if you don’t clean your review system it will be a terrible thing for you as a company!
Two day guarantee.. should mean exactly what you say... totally dissatisfied
KEEPS FREEZING!! Please fix bugs. This app is amazing. If you like to shop online, this app is for you.
1st did I miss a bunch of updates because the app jumped from 9.22 to 11.01??? What is up with that?  I can’t get anything in the header to recognize touch events.  It’s like you running service calls on your main thread or disabling touch interactions while waiting for asynchronous call backs. Please fix.
I have been shopping with Amazon for many years with never a glitch. Suddenly, I cannot check out. “Something went wrong.” After two customer service calls, and missing gifts for my daughter’s birthday, I am instructed to wait for an email from the team. My instructions, “wait and be patient.” So, suddenly it has occurred to me how much I depend on this company for just about everything. My girls all live far away, grandchildren as well, and I live in the middle of nowhere. So Amazon, I will be patient while you get it together so that I may once again send gifts to my family, and I will be grateful.
I have never had any problems with the amazon app until today, whenever I open it it will let me look up just a few things before it stops letting me use the “back” key or any of the other options at the top of the screen. I have restarted my phone re-downloaded the app and it is still the same. I really loved amazon but now I cannot even use it at all on my phone. :( 
I’m an amazon prime customer since the beginning. Up through 2016 or so I’ve never had a problem with the Amazon app.  In the same time, just to dig it in harder (because I’m angry this app’s failure just caused me to waste 50 minutes of my time sorting out their apps problems), Walmart’s app and shopping experience has gotten much better.  However, the past year (or maybe two), this app has become one of my most buggiest and frustrating apps I have.  I have it on all my iPhones and iPads and the problems are on all of them. Here are some of the issues off the top of my head: - problems remembering me. I have to log out and in frequently. - often logging out and in won’t fix issues, I’ll have to remove the app and reinstall it on all my devices to get it working again - won’t recognize Amazon gift cards consistently - when it does recognize Amazon gift cards, it often shows a zero balance on the gift card even though when I check the same gift card on my computer the full balance is shown. End effect: often cannot load gift cards via the iOS app - won’t show my past orders or order status (sometimes due to log in issues) - won’t let me purchase items - half of the time I install a new update from Amazon, the app no longer fully recognizes or authenticates me and I’ll need to uninstall and reinstall all over again  I suspect some of these issues are related to poor implementation of 2 factor authentication. However, other issues seem related simply to general poor code (such as the gift card showing incorrect balance).  Unless Amazon gets its act together with its app, I suspect that its app problems will only get worse with time as the app will get more complex and unwieldy over time.  This is what happens when a company becomes too powerful. Congress needs to break up Amazon. 
Lately; this app is “freezing” up. You would think that a big company like Amazon would take their app development more seriously. I used to like shopping on my phone with the app, but now it is a pain! I hope they fix it. If not , I’ll do my shopping elsewhere.
I have used the Amazon app for YEARS and have never had an issue. Now all of a sudden it freezes up EVERY TIME I use it. Please fix!  I don’t know that I can live with it!!
It would be nice if you could easily switch account to your business account. Maybe I just don’t see it? Something like google drive set up would be great. Or just duplicate the app in the App Store with a new creative name like.... “Amazon Business”
Just updated. Now I can’t tap anywhere in the header area. Got stuff in my cart, but I can’t buy them. Nice job, app devs!
Jeff Bezos  is giving Dreamers $33 million? Well goodbye amazon.  You need to help the homeless in our country and our veterans.  I loved shopping with you but not anymore.
One would think that the “richest person in the world” would employ people who could develop an application that would work properly. This last update seems to freeze the app and when I tap to go back or search for another product, nothing happens. The app evidently has some bugs and response issues at the API level.
Bezos would rather support illegal aliens than pay his employees enough to get off of gov’t assistance. What a cheapskate!
I will order something and then minutes later it will disappear! I have never had this problem before and it makes me want to delete this app and use another one instead. Also the things I already bought won't leave my orders tab and it's not enjoyable to think you ordered something twice and wasted money on something you already bought and received. I was also told I would get an email about fixing it in the next 24 hours. I didn't receive the email. This app is too much work for me to handle. other then that the products, product searches, and product filters are great.
Buggy...non functioning 'back' and 'see all lists' features.  Uninstall reinstall seems to be working to resolve it. 
Every since the last update I can’t go back after reading an item I pick. I have to close the app and come back to nothing! I pay for prime and I sometimes I want to select same day or next day and I can’t sort my search that way any more. Really thinking of not renewing this year!
If Jeff Bezos can create $33 million for illegal immigrants in the US to go to college he should match that for veterans and poor Americans. Especially inner city kids.   Just wow. 
The Amazon app needs to have just one app instead of having multiple different apps for your needs. Just one centralized app that can do it all so you don’t have to go back and forth.
App is nicely built. Good shopping experience
There has been a long-term problem scrolling through your saved for later items in the cart, as the app does battle between showing you that and showing you what other people buy in the same space, usually to the point where it becomes impossible, and it refreshes items it has already shown you against and again. This issues sometimes makes me choose another store’s app to shop with, and you lose business.   The new problem, that let me know there was an issue, was when I couldn’t select items at the top of the screen without restarting the app.   This became frustrating as I missed deal deadlines twice and ultimately didn’t buy the somewhat impulse items. It’s not like I am going to go back and find these daily deals some other times.   I love Amazon, but you need to make it easy for me to buy throngs again. I don’t have an old phone and I have the most up to date iOS. 
I can calm down by having a good little rest. I can be so flexible and get this done!
The buttons are not responsive most of the time. I tap and I tap and it takes me no where.  Their website is so much better.  Pay some money and get some good devs. 
Stupid thing wont respond when I tap any of the top bottoms! This is the only app I have problems with rn and I’m already stressed as it is!! Fix this or I’m going to EBay
I made the mistake of doing some of my Christmas shopping off Amazon.com.  I ordered an item, then after I ordered it, amazon.com changed the picture, and sent me the item they changed the picture to.  So I ended up with an item that I never wanted or even ordered.  The worst part is that they would not give me a refund, they would only credit my account.  I'm now being forced to spend my money with a company that gave me the worst customer service experience of my life.  Please do not let this happen to you.
For the past six months I haven't been able to checkout using the app. It repeats screens several times and then will kick me back a step. It is very frustrating.   I updated the app and I'm constantly checking the App Store for updates for this app in particular to see if it will get fixed.   I guess it's saved some money on impulse buys, but I miss the convenience of being able to order things on my phone/not having to boot up the computer. 
Very bad messages, notifications, tools and more! Bad they can do better but it looks it’s made to fraud, delay, misguide, trouble, and much more knowing the majority of the people will not speak, talk, stand for themselves and get what they deserve, need and what is theirs after lost or win!
Overall I’m quite satisfied with the app, but most of all I love the chat feature. I had an issue with a charge for a channel subscription and after a few minutes of talking with some customer service reps, I was refunded my charge. The chat feature is awesome, especially for those of us who don’t like talking on the phone. Thanks Joshi and Abigail!
I love Amazon and its reliable, helpful, supportive team but here are the areas they need to improve:  1. After wasting time editing and/or updating my reviews, it won’t get through even after many attempts.  2. I ordered same item for the fourth time, but when I tried to update my review, I got denied because it says I’m not an “Amazon Verified Buyer/Purchaser”.  3. The viewers ranking ‘seems’ to have some flaws. It ‘seems’ to make some viewers very high even with less helpful reviews overall.   4. The question nobody had answered and are too old or not relevant anymore stays stuck on your profile. No delete option.  5. The shipping date of 10 to 14 days changed to estimated delivery of up to 21 days upon checkout.   But I’m satisfied with Amazon customer service and they are my top choice. This review is only a small matter related to their app. Amazon remains the best for me. 
I’ve been using amazon for years but unfortunately I’m deleting this app now. They changed delivery carrier from UPS to USPS and they barely meet the expected delivery days. I was a die hard amazon fan but this new shipping system doesn’t do it for me. Always a day or two late. Deleting and cancelled the membership.
I’m disabled enough walking hurts. Shopping requires help. Amazon saves me! The UPS puts inside for me. Returns easy no hassle. Chat support is quick and offer me a credit for my inconvenience ?! No wonder everyone trying to catch Amazon. Service is really the key. Great service. Thank you! If we would just get an Amazon fresh ....
I pay for an annual membership and yet I have to deal with ads playing while I’m shopping on this app which disables any audio to be played while I have this app open! Fix this!!!
When I first started ordering from Amazon in March of 2017 I was so pleased with the service, but lately, my orders are backed up, their later and later, and I’m always buying things, but I’m getting less satisfied with the business
This app runs slow on my iPhone X and iPad mini 4! Very cumbersome to use, it almost makes me want to take my laptop out to shop on Amazon.com. Sometimes it doesn't connect until I refresh the search two or more times.   The customer service chat feature is the worst! Type a message out, but there is no preview of the message until you hit "done" button, so make sure you don't misspell anything!  Speaking of the "done" button, I was chatting with a service representative (who was really nice by the way), I had to press the "done" button upwards of a dozen times before each message would finally send. Once again, this app makes me want to shop with a real computer at times.   I'm honestly shocked that Amazon would put out such a terrible app. 
Still can’t purchase kindle books in the app.  But I can purchase everything else though. 🤔  ******  Not excited about his amazon fresh. I have to pay $15 monthly. And pay more to ship if I don’t spend $50. Furthermore items are all over be place. Pantry, Prime, and Fresh. There’s no way I can spend $50 b/c items are strategically available on different platforms... which requires me to pay even more for shipping.   I recommend using a local grocery store’s delivery service instead. One place to get all of your groceries. 
I have now reached the level of “I feel like smashing my phone” due to repeated (6 times) attempts to change my password because Azon  does not recognize the only password I’ve ever had. I have followed the reset steps each time only to be given the same response, my email or password is incorrect. Well, given that they send me a code to enter to my email, it must be my password is wrong, but wait, I just created a new one, how could it be wrong? Oh, if I want customer service guess what I have to enter? That’s right, my password! AARRRGGHHHHH 
If I filter by size when searching for shoes, it shows the item prices as a range instead of showing the exact price for the size I filtered. For me, this makes it almost impossible to find a shoe.
There entire parent prime house hold bs is bs. If you leave a household, it locks you out of your connected account.
I am very frustrated that I can no longer use one click on this app because it no longer allows for me to choose free shipping over $25.   I was one of Amazon’s first customers back in the early days when it was only books and I buy thousands of dollars worth of goods on here per year. And this is just LAME. I have read all the help pages and nothing works...and the chat function is a joke. No real person to chat with. Just a bot that takes you to the same useless ‘help’ pages you just read but we’re not helpful. What happened to the great customer service I used to get from this company???? 
I had ordered many, many items before using a PO Box. All of a sudden they stopped allowing me to get my items shipped there. I live in a rural area and don't get mail delivery. Talked to customer service and they were absolutely pathetic. Got switched between different people and nobody could give me a clear answer why.
I ordered something with prime and it said two days till delivery but instead it got here in seven days!!!!! Very ticked off!!! Horrible app!!!!😡
I think this app is great. Always a go to, even when I’m at a store I use it to price match.
Why can’t I buy a Kindle book from either my Kindle itself or the Amazon App? Why do I have to go to Safari to buy something? What - you don’t want my money? I can buy other things - why not Kindle books?
Not happy with sellers not disclosing items are coming from China or Europe. I expect an item to ship 2-3 days after ordering and it’s over a week later then it actually ships. This does you no good when you need the item fast. Not only that, the shipping information is so uninformative it’s doesn’t help at all. All you know is shipped and delivered.
No complaints. I’ll change to 5 stars if you come out with IOS Smart Invert (Dark Mode) support :)
Half the time the info is wrong or incorrect and the other times barely an image to know what you are looking at. Between that and customer service, wait, sorry no customer service it’s ridiculous. I have better luck guessing then relying on amazon. Forget about 2 day prime shipping, that’s just a lovely bait and switch advertising gimmick, must be 2 days when it feels right to them.
Their customer service lack intelligence and integrity. They ask you to set up an email but it will not allow you to because your email is already in use. They give you the run around when you orders are lost. Totally rude.
I HATE it when they charge the wrong credit card. I've had to call customer service to cancel the amazon credit card numerous times and it's still an open account. I ordered something less than an hour ago, and now the app will not let me cancel it immediately even though I had a 12 hour window to have it shipped by Monday.
I have been a long-term Amazon customer and recently paid the $100 for Amazon Prime membership, primarily because of their advertised “Free 2-day shipping” with Amazon Prime. Since then, over a dozen items I’ve ordered have taken 10-15 days to arrive. The app and Amazon website are mis-leading and day things like “Ships within 2 days” but provides NO estimate of when it will arrive. I even spoke with an Amazon customer service rep (from a call center in India?) who said that the app and website DO NOT give you the estimate of when the package will arrive until after you place the order and it has been processed. If it ships and isn’t due to arrive until the 10th of the following month, you cannot cancel the order or request a refund until after the package arrives AND you reject the package AND it is received back at Amazon. Very misleading. It would be far more honest and consumer-oriented to change the app and website to give you an HONEST estimate of when the item will ARRIVE, so that you can make an informed decision of whether you want to make the purchase through Amazon or if you’d prefer to just drive to the nearest store and buy it there instead.
Love the ease in which Amazon helps me spend my money. Love the “Buy now” feature. A couple of things I would love to see changed.  1. On sensitive items, have an option when ordering to place the review in a private area, instead of with all others.  2. Allow an alias to be used for reviews on sensitive products for privacy.  3. Allow me to delete reviews in my account.  4. Be more accurate and honest with delivery dates.  Otherwise, I love the app and ease of doing business with Amazon. 
Amazon dropped the ball...... again. This item was guaranteed delivery, but they drug their feet shipping this out and it got delivered AFTER we left for our ski trip. I contacted them 3 times, one of those before it even shipped and got conflicting information, and they ultimately guaranteed it will arrive on time. This is becoming a trend with Amazon. 5th item in two months that missed the guaranteed date. Terrible customer service.
I love amazon but I’ve been charged several times for the annual prime membership without my consent.
Either I can’t figure out how to turn off 1-step ordering or it can’t be turned off. Either can be a recipe for disaster. I had something “accidentally” ordered by my daughter because she hit ONE wrong button. Now I am either stuck with something or I have to send it back and eat the shipping costs because of a stupid feature that I cannot disable. Wit a joke.
Amazon prime, I trusted my families Christmas gifts to you. Not only did you not deliver, you didn’t even tell me. If my family hadn’t asked,  who would have spent my $200 ?  Not a lot for you maybe. But everything to me.
Amazon has the best team that provides help for any problem, they respond so fast to any issue. They have nice staff, and do any and everything they can to solve any issues. 5 stars!!!
Amazon tech support stated the problem “is Apple’s fault” but regardless of why, we can no longer make purchases via the App. Without that ease of use there is little reason to use Amazon over Walmart etc.
I love Amazon this app will get you any service. I love the products and the service is top rate.
After this experience I won’t do business with Amazon again. The third party seller whom they contracted with told me that I would they  get back the purchase price for the shirt which was $55.99; that they would not refund the shipping fees.  So I expected to receive $55.99. I did not receive what I expected, it was shy $15.00. I have only purchased a few items through this company and I am not impressed. I won’t be back.  I have given them 5 years off and on of opportunities. No more.
Listen up I bought a Z Yang AG doll and all we got was a box.Thanks for getting me scammed.God Bless you so you can get a better company and better sellers
App didn’t warn me that you can’t apply a promo and coupon to same order. Gave customer service a chance to rectify situation and they failed. 0 stars
Amazon itself has amazing phone service. They also have amazing policies that take care of the customer. But this app allows you to chat with “customer service” but as cheesy as this sounds, it’s absolutely customer disservice.   The reps take a very long time to help, if they help at all. It literally seems like in everything there always has to be one problem and that problem is absolutely their live “help”. The reps won’t answer questions, they answer very awkwardly on things I had no idea were awkward, it’s like I’m talking to a completely different company when I use the app. I actually uninstalled the app due to the horrible service.   Until they fix the farm they send the app requests to, I suggest calling them or using an email option. Having app reps who are far below a. It also standard of customer service, made me paranoid of having that team of people having access to my personal information inside the app. I do still purchase items and love amazon itself, but their app has actually made me paranoid to use it. 
I want to know when something arrives. Gots lots of stuff arriving from amazon from multiple carriers all times of day. Notifications only allow me to have both shipping and arrival notifies. Don’t care when it ships. With modern day Amazon that almost doesn’t matter anymore. I want to know when it’s on my doorstep and only that.  Also how about a notification complication for the Apple Watch once the first issue is addressed.
I love Amazon. I just ordered something using free shippping, and it estimated a week, but the next day it said it was coming tomorrow by 8 pm. The speed of getting your order is so fast, and they have everything you can think of. This is the only app I use for online ordering, and it is really great. Highly recommend getting this over any other online shopping app!
I went to buy something on amazon & a pop up appeared from amazon stating download the amazon app & we'll give you $5 off your first $10 purchase. I didn't happen. I contacted Amazon customer service who bounced me around to 4 different people. Not one of them had a clue & I had to repeat my question 4 times.  I just gave up & deleted the app. 
This is a terrible company!!!!!!! I am a PRIME MEMBER and this COMPANY SSSSSUUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKKKKSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This version is great with lots of new features. My primary purpose of writing this is really to provide feedback in hopes the Amazon app team will read this:  The feature to return multiple items seems to be broken. At least on my iPhone 7. When you enter the checklist there is no way out of it once you load more items. 
I was shopping on their account for baby things. I was looking at my checkouts and went back and forth on my cart to check if i have everything i need~ i did not placed any order yet but i received an email saying that i ordered this one thing that is still on my cart! On top of that they processed my account to prime membership which i did not want... 😡😡😡
Amazon USED to be the best way to online shop! I always added more items to ALL my orders to qualify for free shipping and I loved the recieving my amazon boxes in a timely manner. Now they hold orders for 10-12 days before even “preparing to ship”. I am very disappointed in their negative efforts to force shoppers to pay for subcriptions to Amazon Prime for the fast shipping they once offered all qualified ($35.00 or more) shoppers before Amazon Prime. Everyone needs to unsubscribe from Amazon Prime to force them to return to fast service for all qualifying purchases!! Until then I’m looking elsewhere.
I’m giving this one star for a couple of reasons. I still have to go to my computer to make a purchase if I want to use Amazon Smile to support a charity. Although it does help that I can add items in the app and they’re in my cart when I go to my computer. Amazon needs to add the Amazon Smile to their app. Also, I was supposed to get a $20 credit from Amazon for installing the app and signing in for the first time and it’s been over two weeks. I have yet to see my credit.
I constantly get the “something went wrong” warning.  I can’t make purchases because of it. I thought a purchase went through and the package never arrived.
I tried to order somethings for my friend and send the items to her house and I put in the address but I accidentally sent it to my address but the app won't let me edit or cancel my order as of 30 minutes after the purchase as of which I have been trying for the entire time
Downloaded because I saw a promotion where I'd get $10 off a purchase of $20 or more when signing into the app for the first time. Then realize that I wouldn't get the deal for 7 business days in my email. Never got the email, so I called customer service. They never heard about the promotion so wouldn't honor it. Deleting the app now because they don't know what promotions they are running.
I find the Amazon app to be fine but I would definitely enjoy that pay pal feature to be able to pay for things also because I don't really like using cards or my personal bank account for transactions so please integrate Pay Pal!!!!!!
Well first off I’d like to say the app itself as far as purchasing is well’mm good but I’m not exactly at all satisfied at being able to get a hold of customer service. I will probably not be shopping here anymore due to their lack of response to my requests for help
I put in a very specific search term. Yet I get a scattered result. For tires I give a wheel size of 16, and get 15 as well. Look for tires and get canvas spare covers. I don’t need the aggravation.
Amazon is awesome for getting certain items you need however the past two times I have ordered parts for my car the description clearly says this will fit your vehicle, however they don’t fit when they arrive. So I don’t think I’m going to be ordering parts for my car from here anymore.
They canceled my order and investigated my account without my permission. One recent customer service didn’t even read the whole previous chat and left the chat while I was explaining the problem exclaiming restrictions. Super rude! If you are bounded to rules, put rules on customers first, will you? I will never buy from this site anymore! เวรเอ่ย
What is that? How can this app be created with such a narrow-minded focus as to miss the ability to buy?
Jeff Bezos worked hard to become the boot and he has used his wealth with tyrannically. The workers deserve much more than the slave compensation Bezos withers to them. 🙌 to the hard working people of Amazon and the big ol’🐦 to Jeff Bezos and Amazon! Go on strike if you have to!
Order today (Thursday, Dec. 21) with Prime, and receive by next Wednesday (dec 27). Wow. Why am I even paying Prime?   Also have had some pretty rude customer service reps as of late. I know things are crazy during the holidays, but this isn’t ok. 
Amazon is just not trustworthy. They allow sellers who rip people off and take no responsibility for that. With all the power they have, they could at least bet their sellers and protect their customers. Eventually people are just not going to trust them and they will look elsewhere.
Amazon and the company delivery “UPS” Are the worsts 
Ever since they moved their customer relations over seas it’s been going down hill! I call can’t understand the other person who is illiterate to multiple issues  Every time there’s a issue your call service or chat makes it worse!!  Glad this opened my eyes before the renewal date!! I will be canceling!!! 
The app is great for shopping and buying.  However, thats where it stops.  Amazon customer service has always been pretty shotty over the years, and they also try to prevent you from contacting them as much as possible by burying the ability to or out right preventing it and forcing you to use online help which only can answer maybe half the questions.  I worked for an outsourcer with Amazon in the past and it was as bad then this is when their contact info by email or phone was easily accessible.
Gave shipping notifications even though I was not signed into an account. This may have ruined a couple Christmas gifts.
Bought a prime item on Sunday, now it’s saying delivery scheduled for Friday? I did not receive ANY notification of its delay and there is NO WAY to contact anyone for help in the app or on the site. Very frustrating.
This app is so great especially with shipping...I do recommend getting amazon prime but if you don't don't worry shipping is still very fast and very easy to use
Amazon wouldn’t give me the $10 credit they promised for signing in... Going back to eBay.
You need to remove that because if multiple people use the same acct they can see if someone ordered a surprise for that person
Be very careful. I tried to use $170.00ish in reward points and magically it was charged to my Amazon credit card. I noticed it the next day before delivery and they said I would have to return it at a cost of $22+ and reorder it. They could not adjust my Amazon card. Excuse me?  How does the bank know if the package has been returned or not?  Stupid. Then I get an email telling me I did something wrong. However I ordered 2 items and the small item used my points. It was the big ticket item, the one I really wanted, that mysteriously got charged to my card. No wonder Amazon is doing so well.
Trying to update payment info, selection for expiration date greys out the screen with no month / day selection wheel.
Remember when Prime shipping meant you’d have your stuff in two days? After all, that’s what you pay $100 a year for. Now it’s become so convoluted and ridiculous that it simply isn’t worth it anymore. You waste time shopping for items only to find out that “Prime” shipping gets you your stuff in a week or even longer. Uh, what am I paying for then? If it’s not able to be to me in 2 days then why is it allowed to have the Prime icon? Quit trying to backtrack on your promises.
Your app is awful and now my girlfriend knows all my gift ideas for her
Had a bad day and amazon just made it horrible. The glitches are bad
I ordered 15 items 9 days before Christmas and all items said will arrive before Christmas. Also ordered 2 items not expected until after Christmas so I paid for expedited shipping to get in 2 days. Not only am I not getting my 15 items until the 29th, but even the items I paid for expedited shipping will be late. When I contacted them they said I can pay an extra $62 to get items before Christmas. Hmmm...
Trying to order a package and send to a different address but every time I put address in-doesn’t save it when go to order.
When I logged on to my account on my browser they had a promo for downloading the app. $20 off next purchase of $40 or more just for logging in to your account through the app. So I did as it instructed and it said congratulation you will get an email with your coupon on 7 days. Ridiculous already, most websites send the coupons right away. Well I of course never got the email and when I called Amazon they said there was nothing they could do without the email confirmation?! the whole reason for the phone call is because I never got it!
I use to love you, Amazon Prime, until you lost your bid and "2-day shipping" now takes a week at times. Not worth my $100 now. Such a scam. So sad to have to let you go.
Why can’t I see customer reviews pictures??? This blows my mind why I can see them on my iPhone app but not on the iPad Pro app? 🤯
This app seems like it was designed in 2012 and hasn't been updated since. Its hard to use and has a few bugs here and there. I tried delivering a package to a certain address and defaulted into a nother address. I didn’t realize this until later so I had to cancel the order.
Not sure where to go, this will be the 4th time in a row that my package will not arrive on the day promised because it’s either shipped to the wrong spot and then it has to backtrack or because it’s just “late” I don’t know what the heck is going on but I’m seriously thinking about taking business else where when it comes to ordering online. First two times I can handle, not four times in a row.
Although items are listed as prime 2-day shipping doesn't mean you will even get the items. Most of the items are listed as available but are truly out of stock in warehouse. I will not be renewing my membership since most items take a week to be delivered.
The app used to work great, now it won’t let me see the status of my orders without closing the app and reopening, and then I can only look at one item before the issue resurfaces. Fingerprint recognition has turned into a complete fail as well, after working flawlessly early on.   I’m gonna add an additional gripe, since I’m here. I HATE the fact that it isn’t disclosed when a carrier (looking at you FedEx and UPS) is gonna turn a package over to the USPS for delivery. My expected delivery dates are nothing more than a made up number these days. Right now I have multiple packages in limbo because of this. Amazon is really starting to disappoint with delivery times. I’m a long time and FREQUENT Prime member and user, and am becoming fed up. I pay for Prime to avoid delivery issues, and the quality of service is takings nosedive. Step it up, guys. 
For some reason the app doesn’t let you see everything arranged by low to high price. It only shows a small amount of the items you searched for when you click the sort button from by relevance to by price low-high the number of options lowers significantly where you might only have a couple choices, even though when it was sorted by relevance there may have been 10,000 items. Kind of ridiculous when you can’t see everything in the order of price.
I have been a prime member for years. In the last few months, I updated to a business account as I use this primarily for business. When I make 1 purchase, I now cannot checkout any other orders again until the next day. It’s literally limiting my purchases to once a day as it won’t let me go to the checkout page. When I contacted support via email, they said to delete the app and reinstall. I did that and now have to delete the app every time I make a purchase, if I want to make more than one purchase a day. I use amazon to make my life easier but now that I’m literally deleting and reinstalling this app several times a day, I may need to start looking elsewhere. Super bummer as I was always a huge Amazon advocate until recently.
This is stupid, I do not see any way to look up the wish lists of other people on Amazon mobile app
I am very disappointed of Amazon right now!! I have ordered something and all of sudden apparently I still owe money for things I ordered. I understand you only charge the card till the items ship but the thing is then why was my card charged the full amount. But couldn’t give me a reason on what all happened and why they didn’t take the full amount out but when really they did because I was charged for it. I called my bank and they told me I was charged with the full amount I paid for and they told me here is some advice wait 24 hours to see if anything changed when I tried to tell them they already charged me for those items and that I don’t want to be charged again for those items when I already paid for them. When I called customer service and I talked to the 2 ladies they were nice and tried to explain but couldn’t explain where my money disappeared too. And when I called again and talked to this guy and told them I talk to the bank they told me you charged me the full amount that I paid for and then saying that apparently owe you guys still $20 when ik I don’t because I paid the full price for the items I bought the guy I talked to was really rude to me. So I’m sorry amazon but you lost your self a customer. I love shopping on here and I never had problems till all of a sudden. I’m sorry amazon you lost a customer.
I have spent the past hour talking to 5 idiots who could not verify who I was Because I couldn’t remember the exact mailing address where I lived 7 years ago and 5 different states and home ago...I am so mad I cancelled the order and if I could cancel the 12 holiday gifts I just sent I would ... deleting amazon and will scream it to the 400 or so people that I know 
The products I receive from amazon are always in great condition and never have any problems. I am fully comfortable buying something on amazon because I know I will get my money’s worth. The products I purchase are useful and trustworthy. Also, amazon products are great gifts for others and I can always rely on amazon to deliver my packages on the expected due date.
I'm addicted, everything is right here ✅I shop here almost 5 times a month  You can furnish the entire house 🏡  You find clothes 👚👙👖👔👗👙👘👠👟🎩🎒  for any occasion. The only problem with that is I wish there was single categories, ie: petite, tall, plus size and so on. 🎶 music, 🎥 movies, and reading books📚  Tons of food 🥘 School books 📚🎓 Adult entertainment 💋💦🍆🍑(❌❌❌) And the prime membership is awwwwweeeeessssoooooommmmmmeeeeee, you can't go wrong with free 2 day shipping 🔃 I just wish " Prime Now" & “Amazon Restaurants” delivered in my city ☹️ "Prime pantry" should have its own app🙌🏾so we won't have to go through all the other things  A grid layout would be nice👌🏾 UPDATE: If we have Prime Membership, we should not have to pay $5.99 shipping for the Prime Pantry 
-still doesn’t  properly support the screen resolution of the new 10.5" iPad Pro.  Amazon has gathered up the world’s wealth but too lazy to compile their app properly..  -the related products list used to be sponsored on top, but the bottom list was not sponsored.  now it is all sponsored.  this is a dealbreaker and i will try downgrading to last version i can find without this change.  else will stop using.   the sponsored products are not selected with my best interests in mind.  they are expensive products priced so that the customer pays a premium to pay for the advertising costs the seller pays to amazon.  shameful. 
All of you that rated it a one star are just haters Amazon is the greatest shopping place made so stop hating
Extremely slow, almost unusable when using as a simple grocery list at the store.
I’ve been a prime member for a very long time. During that time I have used my amazon visa and this app. Now it seems I must re enter my credit card number for everything.  The point of this app is to allow me to shop, which is impossible when I must have my credit card with me 100% of the time. Add that to the fact that amazon does not honor prime shipping anymore and the usps lies about delivery and amazon is fast becoming a joke. Today I was told my package couldn’t be delivered because they couldn’t access my house due to a gate. Bold face lie as the same postal employee delivered my mail along with another amazon package.
My wife and I both have experienced Amazon marketing offers that did not pan out. I was offered a $5 credit for choosing a slower delivery method. My wife was offered $20 for downloading the app and placing her next order. Five plus calls later and an equal amount of guarantees that are credit would show up on our next order, we are still trying to hold Amazon accountable for their marketing promotions. The app is convenient and offers a ton of options, but the principle of being lied to just irritates me to no end!!!
Download this app and did not receive an email as stated with coupon.  Please explain?? 
I love the amazon app. It’s makes things so much easier. I’m always on the go so if I need something quickly I can just pull up Amazon on my phone, find the item, order it and then get notified when it ships and when it arrives.
Will it was my first time shopping on amazon I was trying to buy markers and I did skin tone markers when the package got to my home I was so excited, I open the package and I got a rainbow set of markers??.. Not what I ordered. I thought maybe they ran out? So I decided to buy these crown pencils. I checked it said it was delivered yesterday to my house; by the way I was at my grandpas house spending the night. I come home and the pencils are not at my house?? What’s going on amazon get your stuff together.
Friendly suggestions: ability to use AmazonSmile with the Amazon app and ability to rate customer service after chat (I noticed some agents won’t end the chat so you can’t rate them, so there’s a loophole there)
Charged me for amazon prime after my one month free trial, after I canceled it and called to ensure it was canceled. Terrible app and terrible customer service.
Very buggy app. I realized I ordered two of the same shirts immediately, and tried to cancel one of the shirts days before it even shipped. And the order still wasn’t cancelled. Now it’s shipping and I don’t even have the option to cancel it. I tried going to customer service to cancel it through there and it lets me click on the product but doesn’t show the option to cancel. Just another way Amazon is crooning me out of my hard earned money! I will not continue to be a customer if this isn’t resolved!!

Amazon is the worst company I’ve ever dealt with for anything in my life. At this point I’m pursuing litigation instead of a BBB complaint. Considering it’s such a massive company, their sheer lack of customer service and the way they deal with orders, customer accounts, and customers themselves is outright shocking. I’m over it, I’m going a step further beyond a better business bureau complaint after this week.
I buy A LOT thru Amazon but hesitant to at Christma. If it's not Prime, it's difficult to see where an item is actually coming from prior to ordering it. I have yet to find a place where it notes if it's coming from across seas or not. VERY unhappy as two things I ordered told me After I ordered them that they won't be here for 6 weeks. I tried cancelling one for 2 days and the site kept freezing. I contacted the seller (Amazon still showed item as processing and NOT shipped) and was told it had already shipped and they couldn't cancel it. It didn't show shipped for another day. I messaged them back to ask what the return address will be so I can refuse the package and they didn't even understand what I was asking and responded with instructions just to refuse the package. ANNOYED😠😠😒😒😒
Super easy to use! Super convenient! And omg the shipping and ordering services are so fast, ordered less than an hour ago and my items have already shipped. Love ❤️
Enough is enough! How many times I have to rescan my card or entered my card number manually in this app? Need Apple Pay immediately.
It said order Saturday but then it said arriving Sunday!
Customer service chat feature doesn’t work. App freezes & doesn’t allow you to type
About 3-4 weeks ago, Amazon decided to start using the app’s push notifications to try to sell you more stuff. Once per day you’ll get some stupid notification that has nothing to do with your order(s), account, etc. You can turn it off in your phone’s settings, but that means all notifications are turned off for the app so you won’t get any push notifications about your orders... the info you actually you want! They’re basically forcing you to read their sales notification nonsense if you want useful order update notifications. AMAZON - This completely betrays your consumers’ trust and you might want to question the short term gains compared to the long term UX/brand degradation.
Charged for my “free trial” of Prime moments after I selected free trial. Another reason I can’t stand this company.
Ok I’ve used amazon for years and I like it I really do but now we have to HAVE A SUBSCRIPTION in order to post reviews on products now? I’m only 17 and working a minimum paying job. I can’t afford amazon prime and the one time I want to write a review on something, I can’t because apparently that’s just a luxury only certain people can have???!?!? What the actual heck
There is a number 1 showing up like I have a notification and for three hours I’ve been trying to get this 1 to go away.  It won’t no matter what I do.  Very annoying
Great customer service and great help
Helpful for price checking on the go
Have ordered several things over the years from them, and have had orders cancelled from time to time with no email or notification. Still got billed for said product and had to dispute. Last purchase was supposed to be post Black Friday sale products from a company on amazon. Purchased, paid and order has been cancelled, spoke with customer service and said there is nothing they can do. And product is not available when they look it up, well maybe not now. I ordered it 16 hrs ago. I will be going sticking with eBay and Jet. They honor there little messups, or at least try to fix it
Somehow, someway, you guys charged me for prime. I have bills to pay and I can barely make those payments without you people taking money from my account without my consent. Now I am overdrawn and charged $25 for being overdrawn. I am deleting the app and NEVER will I ever shop from you guys again. So thanks for completely screwing me over.
Amazon stuffs packages into mailboxes damaging them instead of delivering to the door and fails delivery on every other order I place. If you can’t deliver on-time, don’t promise it. Simply refunding the amount paid does not solve the problem. Disappointed.
I love Amazon. I obsessively check the deals of the day on my app, check my wish lists for price drops, and do a lot of browsing regularly. But there are two issues I have with this app.   First, anyone with access to my phone can open the app at any time and see my purchase history. I do most of my gift shopping on this app and I’d like to keep the element of surprise. Requiring a password to view purchase history would easily solve this issue.   Second, I don’t have control over what appears on the home screen. So any item I’ve looked at recently or added to a wish list could be on the home screen. Which brings me back to the first issue. Adding an option to dismiss items on the home screen would solve this problem.   I’d much rather have the app be fined tuned than get the needless addition of social features (Spark! Because you need strangers asking you which camera or scarf they should buy).   I do like the new addition of notifications though. That’s a step in the right direction. 
Amazon is an amazing app for shopping. I get things from Christmas gifts to everyday items. Everything is cheap, but still good quality. If you really want a good experience, get Amazon Prime. You get free shipping (wonderful right?), music, tv, books, and more. Sometimes I will shop on other sites and forget about shipping because I’m used to Amazon 😂. Thank you so much Amazon you do a great job with everything, best shopping app ever! I totally recommend to anyone.
Amazon is great, the app is really useful too, but you get a one star until you make sure no advertisements take over REAL media playback via airplay. There’s not a single person in the world that wants to have their big screen spammed with ads while doing shopping on their phone as they watch or listen to other media. Fix it.

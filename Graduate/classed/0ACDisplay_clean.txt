Loving it so far This is such an awesome app. It appears we can only place one widget on it though. Unless I'm missing something. Right now I have the flash light widget. It's nice to have fast access to it. The only thing that could make this better is being able to set the wallpaper to something other then our home screen wallpaper. My lock screen was a modeling photo of my wife. My home screen is Cortana from Halo. My wife's photo is to busy to be a home screen but it would be great if I could use it as a lockscreen
Brilliant app!! Edit: 'Had to uninstall. Started taking too much resources/battery in the background I don't know, if it's a bug or anything. Kindly fix it.' Really cool. It's a no nonsense app. Please do rem though this app keeps on running in the background and though it's not really a super heavy app but it's not feather weight either. It is perfectly fine by me, coz I find it to be totally worth it. It gives you a buttery smooth experience and the lock screen looks wise is damn cool. Love it. Thank you so much!!
Lockscreen is beautiful! You may call it a beta but if set up right this can be an amazing lockscreen! I have this setup in 3 of my devices! All look stunning! A hat tip to you my friend! SUGGESTIONS: Allow the widget to be centered on the lock screen, currently it's kind of 70% vertical. Allow making the background blurred or frosted rather than darker. I will happily donate to you!
Amazing but little buggy The best one have used. Simple. But not so smooth now. If there is a carrier notification on home screen and if its not removed and screen is turned off and then on again. the app responds abnormally making the ac display lock screen blink continuously. Also if we are able to choose custom background instead of black or homescreen,it would be great! Down rated..fix the bug. would love to rate 5 stars then.
I love this app, such a unique lockscreen from everything else. Rating 4 stars as I have 1 suggestion that I think needs addressing - when I receive a call and don't pickup, the phone remains on the home screen and doesn't lock itself. It's quite annoying when it is in my pocket. Other than that, its a great app. Well done developers.
Fantastic App This app is fantastic regardless! I would love some features like lock screen options, etc. But either way you did a great job. I was using Nils previously and stopped and really didn't find another one I liked until now but I have to try it out and see how it worked in my everyday use.
The s7 Edge is the second device I've had ACdisplay as my main lock screen. Only issue I've come across is recently, when I have a notification and I click the icon, it won't give me any information of the notification in place of the widget anymore. If somebody can tell me what to do to sort that out, I'll rate 5 stars. As of now, it's the only nice looking lock screen worth having.
THIS IS THE PERFECT ONE! Now it only misses one thing: a security. After all, it's a lock screen, so it is pretty ironic for a lock screen to not have a security. Also hopefully more customizable, like being able to change your wallpaper. Also the notification bar shouldn't be able to go down while in the lockscreen. Those are my suggestions.
It's the best I was looking for a lockscreen without any flashy wallpaper or a lot of shortcuts, I mean when I will need an app I'll just open it, there is no need for it to be on my lockscreen. The thing I liked the most about this lockscreen is the way the notifications dissolve when pushed down. The solid color lock and the backgrounds are awesome,I keep them in random order. This lockscreen is The best for the users who love to be simple.
Battery drain I like it. Nice to be able to see at a glance notifications and I love the simplicity. I just wish there was the ability to leave the screen on longer (until I dismiss, 1 hour, etc), maybe contact photos for notifications, proximity sensors, and shortcuts on lock screen. Also, it seems to not play well with Textra. When I get a text message, it will flash the screen on, then turn off and on until I open the notification. I have tried changing the priorities and all other options.
Love it..one question? Crashes from time to time..Battery drain and ram incresed Love the app, I can see all my notifications very quickly in a bubble and close them and it leaves it as unread and keeps me a reminder to open them again later , love the background blur and photo of the person.but the battery drain and RAM usage incresed and you remove the notification of the slide bar? If yes would be happy to rate it a 5 star
Love it, but.. I used this lock screen for a very long time and loved it, but I had to stop using it because there was a bug with it that would disable/shut off my alarms immediately as they were starting. This, in turn made me late for work on several occasions. If that one bug would or could have been fixed... 5 stars, best lock screen ever.
Hey, mate! Nice work! Really love the concept and design. I'm searching some good lockscreen app and then found this one, immediately love it! I have a small favor though, could you please add some security options to the lockscreen feature? I know it's not actually a lockscreen app, but if you could that would be great. If you do, I'll give it 5 stars.
Could had been 5 stars I would had rated this 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I can't put in a custom widget (which was probably the main reason why I was excited for this app). I was able to have it actually work once, but it was also the last. It could had been better if it had its own passcode options. It's such a disappointment that I don't see any solutions yet.

Works great except when trying to filter reviews. Need to fix the bugs. Would be nice to sort by price as well
This app isn’t bad, but: Whenever I add anything to subscribe and save, it adds the item but at the same time, I get a pop-up telling me something went wrong. Clicking on links back to products ordered usually sends you to an oops page with a dog on it. Notifications are random. Worst of all - it’s useless with Amazon links from browsers. Click on a link in safari or chrome to take you to say an amazon page to manage your prime tv channels? It’ll open up this app and tell you the page isn’t available.. it was at that point I decided to delete this and just go back to the web.

Whenever I read comments I like to see the most recent but I haven’t been able to switch between the two. When I click on the option to switch it’s just a blank greyed out screen.
Furious at the fact that I pay $100 a year for prime plus the price of every item I've purchases, yet I am no longer allowed to leave reviews for any product I buy. Because a,axon ASSUMES that I leave good reviews for free products. Maybe some people just leave good reviews because the product is good. There is no evidence to back up their claim whatsoever & I am extremely angry. So Amazon if you want a bad review so bad... Here ya go.
Using this app on my iPad Pro - doesn’t look ANYTHING like the pictures in the app preview.  Typical crappy Amazon software release discipline - release notes are non-descriptive and don’t indicate what’s been changed.  Come on Amazon - you employ half of the town I live in - can’t you get a simple mobile app correct for customers who spend tens of thousands of dollars with you a year?    One NICE thing - at least landscape mode works again.  Wow. 
How come on this app most of the items won’t inform me if it fits my vehicle like dash screens
Everytime I try & buy something it errors out & says “unable to load to cart”
Please make them stop
Great app, except for the irrelevant recommendations. Why would a single man with no kids be interested in women’s clothing or baby-related items? There is nothing in my purchase history, browsing history or wish list that would indicate any interest in those things. It used to seem much more personalized than it does lately, now it’s just annoying.   At least give me a “not interested” button. That way you could recommend things that I might actually be interested in. 
The post few updates have all said things like "Go to the menu" to find the new feature... But the menu does not have these new features.
When I was buying a portable charger everything was going fine until I got to the checkout and it wouldn’t actually let me buy it. I thought it was a glitch at First or my iPad wasn’t working properly, but then I tried to buy a 1.00$ item and it still wouldn’t work.( the first item was eligible for free shipping but even when I selected the free shipping option it would not work) I do like the app but it stopped working and needs to be fixed.
I like the app and its worked well, but through several updates i was hoping this issue would get fixed. It has not. I have several items in my saved for later cart and as I scroll down and it processes to show me those items, it then doubles the number in the list. Scroll down again and now you have 3 and so. I just cant ever get to the bottom of the list.
Under Menu I see nothing about seeing all programs ot a treasure truck.
Sorting by low to high price doesn’t work right forcing you to scroll thru hundreds of items. Who has the time for such nonsense?
The stupid wish list bar at the bottom of the screen is so annoying and, tbh, distracting. I can hide it, sure, but like a bad dream, it keeps coming back. @Amazon - cut it out!
Where is the dark mode for night shopping on an iPad screen in bed? #TooBright  Sharing an item after it has been added to a cart has been broken for years.   Video playback is broken on the main description and isn’t supported for user reviews.   #Fail 
For as long as I can remember, I have always toggled my “Save Browsing History” to the off position. Lo and behold, every time I open the screen, a whole page of every item I’ve looked up recently or placed in my order cart is present. I delete the history, I check to make sure the setting is toggled off - which it always is. Next time I use the app, same cycle. Browsing history saved.   What is the purpose of this? I know exactly what I looked up and if I want to purchase it, I will place it in my cart. I don’t want a reminder or record of it, especially when I have specifically set the feature to the off position.  Also, I despise having the “garage” and “pet” feature in my account. I will NEVER use Amazon for car parts & services and I don’t own a pet. Why not make these features optional instead of having them take up space?    I’ve been an Amazon shopper for over 17 years and your app makes the shopping experience a poor and annoying one. I am using your services less and less as time goes on. 
The list that constantly showed up at the bottom of the screen is completely annoying. There is no way to make it permanently go away.
I would love tmfor you guys to stop getting rid of the easy access wish list at the bottom of the screen. It’s so convenient. Would love for you want to keep it there or at least put an option in the app for people who want it there and for people who don’t. :)
Issue with trying to sort by Recent reviews vs Top reviews.  Tap the button to change to recent and screen goes grayed/highlighted but no option window comes up.
I find the app useful but also very obnoxious. Anytime I got to daily deals and scroll, the images go blank once your start scrolling. Also I don't like that I cannot manage my rentals on the app.
Well, I love shopping at Amazon, but searching for products is a nightmare...  1. Price range not on the list, doesn’t appear until you select other filters and still (you allowed to select only couple options: above $50, above $200 and etc.) Where are fields to enter low and high ???  2. Sorting - absolute disaster (once you click sort by price or any, it removes 90% of results - Leaving you with crap which is not even relevant to the search.... 
Your share links are not consistent, they often share the wrong color or item. What I want is a URL Address at the top of every page, this allows me to share a page of finds, or the company’s selection of items.   Search is missing some search filters that once made it useful. I’d tell you what they were if I weren’t medicated. Yes, you can point and laugh and show your friends. But I would give everything I have not to have to be so f-ing drugged for pain. Anyways onto the rest of the review...  You need to know Search always throws in some items completely unrelated, as in, what does a spatula and other cooking/baking implements have to do with the stockings I am looking for?   Search often ignores the parameters I have set. You must believe that just because I am looking for a size 8 long-sleeve blue mid-length dress, I’d be willing to buy a size 4 sleeveless white miniskirt length sundress. Seriously, I don’t have time for this crap, cut it out! I don’t peruse Amazon for fun, I’m a woman on a mission!   And another search problem, sellers get around search parameters by posting low prices that are not quite true. After you open the page and feel you have found what you wanted, you click to add it to your cart, suddenly your item is far more expensive than you remembered it being!! What happened?  You go back to double check, that’s the real expensive price all right. You begin looking at all the other items, they are all expensive, except for ONE. One hideously ugly item that you would never buy, THIS one item is priced at the lower price that brought you in.   These search problems prolong my searching, there have been times I have given up and not spent any money because I just could not look at one more page. You don’t want to do this to people who do all their shopping here, (I’m disabled). We spend enough to be respected. 
I’m in the process of making a baby registry. First, when I click on items in my registry it will not let me view them. At all. Can not view size or any other details. Can not delete item. Nothing.  Second, I can not just add items to my registry. First I have to add item to a list. Then go into the list and “move” it to my “baby registry”.  A nice feature to add and I am so frustrated that it’s not a feature at all, I (and probably many other registry makers) would like to be able to go back through and group certain items together. For instance, I would like to group a specific shirt with a specific pair of pants with a specific pair of shoes with a specific hat,bibs, onesie, etc. Or a certain sheet set with a certain blanket. It would be easier for the gifters as well! No organization :( 
It’s amazon. It’s fine. You can buy anything and the government subsidizes each package to the tune of $1.47 or some such thing. We all know this.   My issues are these:   1. You can’t delete items in your order history. Yes I know you can hide them. So what. When you go to write a review the item appears again. I don’t need amazon or anyone else remembering everything I have purchased over my entire lifetime. Drop it after 30 days or some such thing OR at least give us an option. “Check this box to permanently delete this order. You understand doing so means you cannot return anything and all reviews associated with this order will be lost.” If I have had a product for 2 years and the warranty was 90 days why do I need it in my history if I don’t want it there? It is my account let me manage it.    2. What is going on with prices? I’m finding lower prices elsewhere online and even locally. That used to be a rare thing. 
UPDATE: apparently iPad got the wrong app version with the previous update. The latest update fixed everything and it’s now like it was previously.  The latest update is terrible. I hate the layout and they took away the quick access buttons at the bottom of the screen. Also none of the option selections work when in/on an item page (eg. size, color, etc). The app might look more “modern” but it’s several steps back in functionality. 
Hardly ever works, hardly ever shows pictures when searching, can never access My Lists, half the time won’t let me change sizes, add to cart, change colors, leave feedback....works less than 30% of the time
Option choose square totally broken
Can you add Amazon Smile compatibility. I’d buy more from the app if that was a feature.
Books filter should include type of edition: paperback, digital, kinddle, etc Clothing filter should include type of cloath 
The best thing put the dash button in the home page. The only thing that they need to improve it when i do and order to asked for my fingerprints to complete the purchase thanks
I’ve been having a lot of trouble with the Amazon app lately. Currently, I am unable to sort by most recent reviews. When I click on the section to do so, it just gives me a gray screen. Please fix this!
Will change rating when app is fix.
Just updated my app and now it won’t let me on the app. Every time I open the app it just takes me back to my home screen.
The app wont let me see my order history. As soon as i click on Order History, it will ask for ny password and after entering the correct password it will just keep loafing. I will have to click on some other tab and then back on Order history to see the list but as soon as i click on any past order, i will throw me back to Password screen and same thing will happen that it will just keep loading after the correct password entry. I also can’t change shipping method/speed through the app, if i click on the shipping tab, it will just take me back to my cart. It is so annoying. I have just started using the mobile web browser version instead.
The product is good is the price I was not to happy, these 2 items I brought was $45 and changed it up to $59 no, I’m not going to buy amazon again! Plus it was a free shipping and it’s not a free shipping, not going to shop there again.
The only thing that works on the app is buying stuff. If I want to access my account to manage anything it tells me something went wrong.
Ridiculous. App does not even link to the “shop nowL item being offered!
I love using the amazon app to buy things and browse through products. I am also a huge fan of audiobooks and Audible. I wish that this app would allow me to buy my audiobooks, or use my Audible, free book a month, token. The app works amazing and is easy to use, but I just wish they would fix this.
Since the update, the app won’t let me add clothing to my cart - I choose the size and the color and then click “add to cart” and it alerts me in red to choose a size, which I’ve already done. I’ve tested this on multiple items and it’s the same each time. It’s extremely irritating. The only way to add clothing to my cart now is to sign into my amazon account on safari and add the item there and then go back to shopping the app. I hope this is fixed soon, as I’m a frequent Amazon shopper, especially for clothing. We have a baby coming and my registry is on Amazon as well. So, I’ve been ordering a lot of items recently. I wish I hadn’t updated the app now, what a pain.
Tried to buy a pair of shoes. Amazon has added new sizing help, but you can’t actually choose a size. Keeps popping up an error “need to select a size” even though I have. So it’s impossible to buy a pair of shoes. Amazon’s loss. I bought from another store. This is a bummer because I literally turn to Amazon first.
I’m trying to buy a shirt and when I choose the correct size and color it says ! Please select a size I already if this is not fixed I will switch to eBay
I use exclusively on iPad.  The toolbar is gone from the bottom of the page, which was so much easier than the drop down menu.  When linking from ATK to buy recommend products the page doesn’t let me save item to my list.  It just circles and circles.  Plus the page looks completely different and navigation is wonky.  If I go in directly from the app it looks just the way it used to.  I have no idea where this dash board is in the app despite following the instructions in the help section.  There is no way to save something to my dashboard.  All in all it’s a bust.
While I love using the wish list, it disappears off my screen all the time. Tiresome having having to long press any item to pull it up, it used to always show.
I find most anything I look for at Amazon and exclusively use this app with no problems. Making, changing and even cancelling orders is a snap—as well as returning items bought. No complaints whatsoever. 👍
Unable to make changes. I.e.  cancel 1-click. Somehow everything I order is duplicated. About to stop using Amazon.
The new update is more time consuming.  Where is the “clear my search history” feature?  Don’t want to see other stuff I am no longer interested in on the home page.  Why remove the quick buttons across the bottom?  They were so easy for navigation.  The new colors are also a real turn off.  Please remove or make optional the “add to wish list pop-up.”  It is REALLY ANNOYING when it pops up because I held the item too long when scrolling.
If you select an item with various options (color, size, dimensions, whatever), the touchscreen scroll doesn’t work. It scrolls the window behind the size selector modal. Please fix! This is incredibly frustrating!!!
Where do I start? The layout is clunky and requires an extra step in the drop down menu to go anywhere off of the home page, & you can’t enlarge by tapping pictures anymore- it’s a pain in the neck to have to zoom in and out instead of a quick tap. But my biggest complaint is that on the deals page I can’t choose a size or color- when I tap the arrow, it “blinks” but doesn’t give a drop down for a choice. In other words, if you have to make any choices before ordering, you might as well forget it. Haven’t tried on the other pages yet, but if they are the same it needs to be fixed if you want any orders! Very disappointed- I shop using this app frequently, but will stop if it’s too frustrating to use.
It doesn’t show up on the up anymore!! I have to go on my computer and use google chrome to be able to see it, but now it’s gone on the app! It was fine 3 days ago now it disappeared
Amazing app, I buy everything frequently from mobile Amazon, particularly stuff from Daily Deals, only bug I sporadically see is product images disappear when I’m deep down in the default list view. Please fix and maybe even add a feature to save place (in list) and deep link back to same spot after a time sensitive LD checkout.
You cannot add items to your baby registry on the iPad version of this app. It works on the iPhone app just fine.
First, why can't I buy the books I want via your app. That makes no freaking sense. Just like I can't buy audiobooks through the Audible app. Great job!  This is by far the worst shopping app out there. I can't see previous price points on items with price drops. This app crashes from time to time. You can't exit out of one list and go to another without shutting the app down completely.  Amazon, if you want me to use your app, make it user-friendly. Don't just ignore the negative reviews because you're Amazon. This app is a complete waste of space.  I check my lists everyday for items for price drops I may want to buy. Take this to heart, your app doesn't make this user-friendly. In IOS I set up my lists via Safari so I can just open directly to the set perimeters. Then you screwed that up too (in ALL browsers) and desktop too. Fix your crap. 
For some reason the idiots “updated the app to look like the web page but without the functionality! Previous version could access the deals or orders directly from a bottom banner—-no more. But the real killer is that they added a glitch that inactivates the option buttons when you want to select a size, Coker or other option. So you have to open the web page to order. 
a) why can i only use this if i'm on wifi? b) the add to wish list option is text and not styled as button.  please fix these problems. 
Considering its an app from one of the biggest companies, it’s pathetic.  Only button works 100% without fail is ‘buy’. The rest, only works when it feels like it.
Some odd reason won’t allow me to cancel an order the same day I purchased an item, can’t search items within the price range anymore. And also the product will display a price and then suddenly changes when you clock on the item to view it or when selecting other options from other sellers. Needs a lot of improvement for an app that’s been around for some time. Until my review stays at two stars, when changes are up to date- I’ll hopefully give a positive review.
App goes into an endless loop when I try to check out. Perfect way to stop me from buying anything, ever!!!!!!!!!!
The latest update on this app is not good.  While looking at an item, I can’t pick a different color or and quantities to purchase. There is an arrow for selecting the color or quantity but it doesn’t work. I have to go to the online store (not the app) to select color or quantity.  I really hope they fix this.
My only complaint currently is that Apple Pay isn’t a functional option for me. I use it everywhere else and up to a month ago used it on here. Now there is no way to use the tool that I feel is very secure and safe with my money. Any feedback on what has transpired with this problem would be greatly appreciated.
The new App layout is utterly abysmal on iPad, with inconsistent font sizes (often too small), sloooow scrolling, and size/color pull downs that don't work AT ALL. Whiskey Tango, Amazon?! I thought you wanted to sell stuff, but you're actively keeping me from buying with this terrible app. Stop making my stock devalue!
The last changes in this app are making me so frustrated when trying to search for any item. Sometimes the filter button disappears and I’m not available to find what I’m looking for. Frustrated and disappointed 😠😒😒😒😩😩
The latest update is TERRIBLE. Lost the menu at the bottom which I used all the time and no way to add it back. App freezes constantly and have to close out and reopen. Who thought this was a good idea?
They routinely take your money, send you empty boxes or the wrong thing, and then leave the ball in your court to print stuff and return it just to get your money back. Zero help. They are diliberate lay unhelpful in hopes you will give up and let them keep your money. Happens all the time.
Can no longer sort my wishlist by price drops. Please bring it back!!! Also when you add an item to a wish list, there's a little box that pops up. Even if you close the pop up box, it stays open everytime you add something to your wishlist. 
The ap is great except for the fact I can’t leave feedback on some items. There is no option.
No option to leave seller feedback in app. Cannot do in mobile either. MUST BE ON DESKTOP? FIX FIX FIX!!!
I make a lot of purchases from Amazon... The latest update totally clutters the screen with distracting pictures of items they are trying to sell you.  Some of the shopping filters are missing.  It’s more like a high pressured shopping advertisement than a useful tool to make Amazon purchases!
I get REALLY tired of my shipping preferences being shifted to standard from free when I try to correct or change my order. Really guys it l hate ordering from you and find myself using jet more and more.
Look like the shopping list at the bottom disappears after the update.  I can’t find the setting to enable it.    It is very convenience to have that list there so I can drag shopping item there for quick review and comparing at a later time.   Please put it back or provide an option to enable it.  Thanks 
Major problem: Cannot use pull down menus on any item pages.   Also seems like a big waste of space horizontally which also means I have to do much scrolling for info. 
Nothing will ever load within the app. I click my orders and it always fails. When I search within the app nothing never loads
This app is my number 2 shopping app I use for all time but just need to add more things in there, not much option lol. Maybe a little more about Asian stuff? Since me and all of my friends r recommended by me using the app! I love how it’s primed, but NEED MORE products and things are little pricy. Thx
UPDATE: The new update is much better, as long as I’m not purchasing something that has pull down menu options (size/color etc), because it won’t open the menu. So my options are to either buy whichever color is preselected, as far as clothing or items that have nothing preselected I have to go to the website to make my purchase. I love that customer review images are showing on my iPad now, this is great so I no longer have to use my iPhone to see those. Keep up the improvements and bug fixes. 👍  The newest update has fixed the ability to select options and pull down menus. It is still having issues scrolling through pictures of items, it will show the first image, and then when I scroll sideways to look at other images of the product it just shows a loading symbol and doesn’t load any more images. Otherwise it is working much better. I am really missing the customer review images on the iPad app though. I hate shopping on my iPad, and then having to pull out my iPhone to be able to see the full reviews with any customer uploaded pictures.   Original review: This app has become unusable since the last update. I can’t select options in the pull down menus, it’s extremely slow and doesn’t load properly, I have to use the regular website to order and view items. 
Thank you, thank you, thank you for FINALLY adding a back button that consistently works and goes all the way back through my searches. This was the one thing I needed to make this app close to perfect. Yay!
Hard to navigate. No consistency on product page layouts. Inconsistent font sizes. No more easy access menus. Can’t find where to clear browsing history. Overall nothing more than anon stop ad pushing anything but what your trying to find!
What happened to the bottoms on the bottom?  It was so easy to check the status of orders - just press the “your orders” button on the lower right.  Now you need to go through the menu.
The new layout for the iPad is terrible. I stopped using the app on the iPhone because of the way it’s laid out now it looks like I’ll delete the iPad one as well. What happened to my viewing history? I rather have the buttons on the bottom than have to go through multiple menus. If I search my purchases if I want to do another search I have to completely close out the app, reopen it and try again. If I attempt to see top selling products from a seller it encounters an error and tells me to try again later. A whole area is dedicated to Amazon restaurants and you don’t even have one in my state. Pics and videos are no longer available in any review area. If you attempt to view a video from the manufacturer the app crashes. The blue bar at the top wastes a lot of space (probably could have but my viewing history option in the white space) is just annoying and is an abhorrent color. If you hit the wrong button you have no way of going back, you have to go through the entire process to get back to where you were (another reason for a viewing history button). The photos in the apps description are not accurate representations of this app. Roll it back and try again.
The links in the app don’t allow users to find to information easily.  I want to find how to view or manage my prime subscription and set up notifications before renewal.  The default is to not notify users before the automated renewal.   Making purchases & finding orders— EASY.  Finding needed settings options— TERRIBLE  To find amazon prime option settings I looked under “notifications”, “your account “, “account settings”, “memberships & subscriptions “, “settings”, .... Obviously, I’ve overlooked the link.  I guess I’ll go to my desktop computer to find the link. 
Sort by price when there are 10,000 products, is not an option. Filter by price needs to exist. It is a really easy and simple feature. I will change my rating once I can do this on every search.   Full screen cart for iPad. I don't need little windows to open up and stuff to be super fancy. Sometimes I am trying to compare the cart to wishlist items like I can on a full screen cart, but not in the iPad app.   Allow me to download all of my wishlist and save for later history. There is a reason it was in there and now I have to fire up a computer to buy something. 
Previous app not that great to begin with but workable. Latest update added “fancy” background but made the app worse. Difficult to get info on items including Best pricing and ratings. Seems like the whole idea is to encourage one to make an impulse buy with as little information as possible. Going back to the website on my IPad.
I can’t access the wishlist tray anymore. It’s just gone.  Is it disabled now? Or gone? 
1. Last update removed the browser history, along with the ability to remove items from the history.  Sometimes I look at an item, but do not want it, or associated items, from showing up on my home page.  Why do developers change things without actually thinking about what the customers might want?  2. Whoever thought up that pop up in the cart needs to be reminded that things like this pop up annoy customers.  I save items in my cart so I can either find them later, or wait for a price drop.  I don't want that pop up jumping in every few items as I scroll through my cart.  Don't care what others are buying, it's MY cart.  Let alone, actually seeing something in that pop up that you might be interested in, only to have it disappear so quickly that you can't click on the item.  AND, it shows items to the right, but it doesn't scroll sideways! 
Release 11.02.0 is the definition of insanity. They removed ALL of the menu buttons. The entire splash screen is tiny product photos with no descriptions or prices. You have to dig deep into a hidden menu to find your previous and open orders. The browsing history view is gone, replaced by a dedication option to buy a Prime membership which takes you to a useless page that says Prime memberships are “out of stock and they don’t know if they will ever be in stock again”. Huh?  What are they thinking?!?
The little red number on apps icon is not go away!!  There are no notifications or messages etc but the red number one won’t disappear!
Had to change my password and all of sudden nothing was working on the app. Even after I was finally able to enter my new password it wouldn't let me place any orders. Didn't even give an error. If I clicked "place order" it just took me back to my cart. Endlessly annoying. Had to delete the app twice and reload before it allowed me to place orders again.   New bar on bottom of the screen wants me to drag items there to save. NO THANKS. My phone has limited screen space to begin with. I hate annoying banners that I cannot get rid of. I use my various lists to save items if I want. Worst feature ever for mobile, please get rid of it! Starting to get super annoyed with Amazon lately and with all the negative things I hear and read about their business practices and the way they treat their workers I'm rethinking my Amazon usage.   The best thing Amazon had was their reviews and now they've revamped how stars are calculated and with all the fraud rampant on their site with reviews I just can't trust any reviews now either. And why are all the Amazon prime items $10 more than third party sellers offering free shipping?!? We are already paying $100 a year for prime plus a huge markup on each individual item?? This is starting to seem like a ripoff. I guess all good things come to an end. 
Since the latest update on my tablet, I can’t choose any options on the lightening deals. Won’t let me choose size, or color, or ??? Can’t shop like that.
Please put the app back the way it was; this is awful!
The menu drop down that used to be on the top right near the shopping cart is no longer there.  With that it was so easy to see your orders, browsing history, etc.  why did you do away with it?  Bring it back.  Thank you
We can no longer logout of the app? Why?? If you want to stay logged in, fine, but why did you remove the ability to logout?!? I have 2 accounts, for different purposes. Please restore the ability to logout. If it's still there, I can't find it
Everytime I scroll through my cart, when it loads more times it will duplicate what's in my cart, so I'll see 3-5 of the same item. Frustrating as can be.
The new update doesn’t let me filter the search by price ranges anymore. Before i could search for products between a certain price ranger ie “$10-$15” or “$20-$25” And so forth, but the new update doesn’t even give me that option. I have to sort products from low high now, but the app for some reason takes out a bunch of products when I sort by anything other than “relevance.” Like if there are 300 products, and I decide to sort by price or rating or anything other than relevance, then suddenly there are 120. I don’t know why it takes out a lot of the products, but it does.   Another thing I want changed is the recommendations. It used to have the \"not interested/I already own it\" feature on there. That made it easier for me to see anything I was actually interested in but now that it\'s gone, a lot of items I show no interest in are showing up and I can\'t make them go away. Like some of those things are showing up because someone else (a friend or family member) searched something on my account to see how much it would cost. So if that feature was back, I could get rid of the items that show up in my recommendations and see stuff that I want and be more likely to buy things considering, you know, I’d ACTUALLY see what I wanted. 
I love Amazon, I’m a diehard Apple user and Alexa is one of the few non-Apple devices I rely on. I’m a prime member and a dedicated Amazon user and supporter BUT this is the first time I’ve had a complaint. I’m already paying for prime membership do I really have to have these pop-ups like wish list tray?  I hated it when Amazon merged with audible.com and I still do but I bit the bullet and try to make it work but changes aren’t always a good thing. Sometimes I think the programmers get bored and right code so they won’t lose their jobs. The simplicity is slowly fading, there’s 3000 different kinds of prime memberships. Who can keep them all straight? And why should I have to work that hard? Apparently some of them are only for certain geographical locations. If that’s true, don’t show me the ones that don’t apply to my area. You have my address, Amazon.  Worst of all, since ios 11.2 the app freezes Constantly. I have to quit and re-launch about four times a day. Yes, my iphone 6s+ is a few years old. I’ve been too lazy to go into the store to upgrade but it’s not that because this is the only app I have to constantly re-launch. Could it be that you’re putting too many pop-ups and wish list trays into the app, Amazon? Stop. It’s stressful enough spending money don’t over complicate it. Anybody can be replaced. Don’t turn your back on the features that made you popular, ease of use. Goodbye 
Good easy to search and use. Needs improvement on stability.
What is the deal with the “saved for later” list? It shows 2 or 3 of each item and will not load all items. This should’ve been fixed in the previous updates. The list is unusable.
Just updated the app. Saved an item to a list. Didn’t give me an option of what list to add it to. Tried to view list. Told me my app was out of date and needed an update. Follow the link to the App Store and guess what? I have the latest app! Ever heard of QA? Perhaps less time on finding a second HQ and more time testing your app.
Is there an option for enabling the list tray?
The wish list tray things is very annoying. Please give us the option to disable it.
Why isn't there a way to have a search filter applied ALWAYS?
Used to use it all the time, but in recent weeks it keeps bouncing back to the cart when Im trying to check out. After years of using Amazon, it’s time to find another source! Disappointed!
When trying to sort the Top Reviews or Recent Reviews with the pull down menu. There is supposed to be a pop up however, it never pops up. The screen just grays, but no pop up. Touching again brightens the screen to normal but there is no pop up to change between Top Reviews to Recent Reviews.
Great app, would love to minimize the wishlist tray.
Other than the tray at the bottom constantly popping up & I have to choose hide, I love this app. It has been extremely convenient for me.
This app works fine when searching at home, but it will not work inside the Lowes store. App returns "internal error".  My iPhone is set to allow this app to use cellular data.  Otherwise the app works well. 
Amazon is great but the app is terrible. Freezes frequently and just plain quits working on a regular basis. I’ll be looking at an item and the app’s back button won’t work so I have to go to the home page and start my search over. Last night was trying to submit a return and it got stuck scrolling down the page. Just annoying glitches considering I regularly update the app, often times have to delete it and re-download it.
I want to Eliminate/disable 3rd party purchases! They never come in correctly, they are always broken or improperly packaged! To make it worse they never take anything back or they take forever to process a return! Please give me the option to get rid of 3rd party purchases! Also! Pictures illuminating fabric cut and style would be great!
Whenever I change the sorting to priority(high to low) and I change the number or priority of something on my wishlist and save it, it goes back to the default sorting. I wish it would stay in the priority (high to low) setting.
When I add items to cart quantity doesn’t show on top right hand corner. I’m also not able to turn off history.
Literally can’t save anything or drag anything to my wishlist. This app has been like this for at least the most of 2017!!! Was hoping it be fixed after how constantly like every week there’s always an update and it’s Amazon IMO data eater!!!
The shopping could be much more user friendly. The email is atrocious. I can’t even delete an email and there is no real way to sort decently. The search’s throw in random items and even general searches are way off base much of time. Unless you know exactly what is the name of the product. The filters are oddly specific and yet completely unhelpful. Categories need work.   That being said- I can find many things here and it helps reduce my shopping time. Instead of ten stores, I go to one. My products are reliably delivered for free, my car syncs to their music channel, their video has a decent selection and Alexa comes in very handy. So... pretty good overall. 
I had an issue on an order and there customer service resolved it in under a minute.
Can’t believe it’s been down for this long... can’t really even remember the last time it worked. Keeps you from having easy access to shipment info as well.
I have to go to my iPhone or computer see the pictures in the reviews if I’m on my iPad.
You can’t change quantity of items there is no combo box for quantity oh have to delete item and re-add to cart be because there is no control of quantity box anymore
Put an option to disable it because it is aggravating that it pops up EVERYTIME I save something to my wish list. It's ANNOYING!!
I often find myself struggling to find the Amazon warehouse deals section on the mobile app especially when I can’t navigate to a certain section mainly automotive. Please add a way to either filter to it or similar functionality to access available in full site.
(1) For the first few minutes after installing the present app (for a second time!), I could press "Your Other Lists" and view my Shopping List. Then, it's stuck in Wish List.   (2) I often press the "Return". Nothing happens.   Never had these problems before the app was changed. 
This is such a bad thing I have never seen like this. Every time I add 4 items it’s just saying I can’t get free shipping. Each stuff has option to choose free shipping but some items doesn’t and if I try another time it never works. Please do something. This is makes me feel irritate.
When I search on my iPad, none of the reviews have pictures and it will scroll in a continuous loop  between the first page of reviews even if I click to see more. This does not happen when I look on my android app, so I usually end up searching there if I am looking for something that I want to see pictures of. That is a pain because it is smaller.  I actually do like the wish list but I find it difficult to switch between lists. 
Recent feature: whenever is scroll down in my Shopping Cart into my Saved Items and App has to load more data, it Doubles up every item in my cart. (Just a display issue because doesn't show them doubled up on laptop.)   And then when I scroll down more to load more items it Triples every item in my cart.  Due to this I'm not seeing any more items just more of the same.    Wish I could add a screenshot to this review. 
Good except when I try to scroll through my saved later it just shows me the first five items over and over. It loads like it will show the rest of the list but just shows me the same things. Sometimes it’ll show me three or four of the same thing in the list when there is only one of that item. It’s very inconvenient because I can’t find the things I’ve saved for later to buy them.
can you guys please add an archive option for your amazon app on mobile
Only complaint now is the list tray... with limited real estate on the screen this idea seems better suited for desktop or tablet versions of the app. I know there is an option to hide it but it always seems to come back.
Overall I really like using this app, but it gets 3 starts for 2 reasons: the number of bugs, most recently the issue with the top taskbar becoming unresponsive after a few minutes (have to view a wish list then search from there to make it work).  My biggest issue though is the service from USPS. Just like I’ve seen others mentions online and in my apartment building, there’s a real issue with getting packages delivered.  At my building, if it’s the weekend you’ve got maybe a 50/50 shot of it arriving, they will lie and say they cant’t “access the building”, when in reality they just don’t try to deliver it. Amazon will give you all the sympathy in the world, and even extend your prime membership but they just don’t get that no one cares about that—we just want our stuff on time! They need to switch back to UPS or FedEx and stop being cheap! 
Return screen freezes if you do more than one item at a time.
I’m not sure when these issues started happening. I’ve always enjoyed using the app to shop and research products on the go. Lately though, I can’t stay logged in, I can’t make purchases, and the stupid tray pops up every time I add something to a wish list. For the love of god, stop trying to add so much!! Every time there’s an “update” I think the issues will be resolved, but instead there’s another new feature. Annoying!!!!
Imposible to navigate with latest version, would not go back, would not return to home page, etc. Total disaster. Never had problems with it, with this update the app is useless. 
I like most things with this app however the newest update will not let me hit the back button to go back to my search results. Restarted the app and my phone multiple times and no luck. Also wish I could disable wish list on the bottom of the screen it takes up space and I don’t need to view it constantly.
The Only real complaint is why isn’t there a way sort the results by most reviewed
Usually works great but today it’s freezing every time I open it. Also, disable list tray. I placed Christmas present ideas In lists and every time I open the app it shows the items which defeats the purpose of hiding them in a list.
Since using this app for my baby registry, I’ve discovered tons of issues. I often can’t click on items in my registry (it doesn’t display sizes selected and I have to go to the item each time to remind myself what I’ve registered for) and have to minimize it, wait a few minutes, and try again. When I do manage to click on an item on my registry, the back button takes me back to all of my lists, not my registry. Recently I can’t even access my registry at all and have to go through Safari. I try to click on my lists but it’s like there is no link. Nothing happens.
I’m rating the app a 1 star rating only for the simple fact that the pesky tray feature is absolutely annoying! I can hide it, I can minimize it, but no matter what I do I can’t ever seem to get rid of it. It’s absolutely annoying that every time I save something to one of my wishlists, that stupid tray will automatically pop up again. If it wasn’t for this feature, I would have give the app a 5 star rating because other than this, I absolutely love this app.
You guys broke the nav bar!!! When I first open the app the nav bar works great. BUT, after I select YOUR LISTS I'm taken to the default list, fine. But then when I try to change to a different list, shopping cart or do anything in the nav bar NOTHING WORKS!!!! Frustrating!!!
Just updated. Now I can’t tap anywhere in the header area. Got stuff in my cart, but I can’t buy them. Nice job, app devs!
After selecting an item to look at more closely the IPhone version will not let you back out to the searched items also cannot access the search window and other items along the top menu. Couldn’t find any other location to make a bug report except for this comment section.
Amazon is a safe haven. It has mostly been updating for the better which I’m surprised despite how old Amazon and this app, themselves are! The only thing that has been bothering me for quite sometime is that the number of items you have on your wishlist can appear and sometime it isn’t. I’m not picky but if I was going to save some memory unit, I would have to know for sure how much stuff I have all together on my wishlist. Counting does work but if I loose count somehow, it can take a lot of time and effort.
When clicking on certain links in the app such as trying to change wish lists the app won’t even respond.
I can’t choose to check my cart or search or even my account tab
I cannot access my wish lists. The first list might come up but then the "see all lists" button doesn't work. I can't get to my book list! Dude, do not mess with my books. Ever.    Horrible browsing due to wish tray. How many times do I have to hide the stupid thing? Just because I add an item doesn't mean I want the whole stupid tray back up! Give it to Waldo so it can get lost!      Second, last night I couldn't even change pages if the tray was up. (& it's up all the time) I'd save an item then hit the go back & would go no where. Took me a minute to figure out I had to hide the tray before being able to navigate. What's next for an update? Invisible secret decoder rings?    I'm annoyed because I have to repeatedly turn off & clear browsing history.    Would love if off actually meant off! The enthusiasm of the save tray is obscene. Make it stop. 
Please disable wish list tray.
There has been a long-term problem scrolling through your saved for later items in the cart, as the app does battle between showing you that and showing you what other people buy in the same space, usually to the point where it becomes impossible, and it refreshes items it has already shown you against and again. This issues sometimes makes me choose another store’s app to shop with, and you lose business.   The new problem, that let me know there was an issue, was when I couldn’t select items at the top of the screen without restarting the app.   This became frustrating as I missed deal deadlines twice and ultimately didn’t buy the somewhat impulse items. It’s not like I am going to go back and find these daily deals some other times.   I love Amazon, but you need to make it easy for me to buy throngs again. I don’t have an old phone and I have the most up to date iOS. 
After looking at a page or two he app freezes and won’t navigate to any other page.  Won’t go back... won’t do anything.  I have to close the app and try all over again and same thing.  Please fix bug and I will switch back to five stars.
After the new update I can't search can't scroll back lot of features don't work
If I add something to a wish list from an item search, and then try to return to that same search by using the back arrow, the app locks up entirely. The only way to do anything is to force close the app and then reinitiate the item search all over again. This is both tedious & inefficient for someone (for everyone, really) that does multiple product searches throughout the day. In the past, I have overlooked multiple small glitches; but this is makes the app rather useless in its current state. (Unless, of course, you only ever want to search for and save one item to a wish list.)
This latest update is buggy. Won’t allow me to go back to list of items. I have to close app and remove from history then re-open app to search another item. Quite annoying. I know first world problems but still annoying.
I can calm down by having a good little rest. I can be so flexible and get this done!
So this app which was a good way of ordering stuff quickly is little by little becoming a bloated app whose purpose is to deliver ads to you.  It’s starting to feel Orwellian. 
I’ve never been a fan of this wish list tab that pops up when you add an item. I know what I’ve added to my wish list, and taking up a solid amount of my screen to remind me does me no good. Stop trying to shove consumerism down my throat. I’ll buy it when I’m ready to, that’s why it’s not in my cart.   The reason it gets 1 star though is this feature now causes my amazon app to not be able to go back to what I was previously viewing. As in, when that pop up comes up, the arrow at the top left corner stops working until you force close the app or hide the pop up wish list. This is especially frustrating when it doesn’t load and is just a white box that you can’t hide.   PLEASE JUST REMOVE THIS BAD FEATURE. 
Does not let you filter search results by custom price range, and does not let you search in a particular category.
Stupid thing wont respond when I tap any of the top bottoms! This is the only app I have problems with rn and I’m already stressed as it is!! Fix this or I’m going to EBay
Sick of the stupid List Tray showing up on  the app it’s not useful and I don’t want it! Add option to turn it off! I already give amazon way too much personal information
The Amazon Warehouse Deals used to show up without having to go in to each item, directly from the list that came up from a search. Where’d that go???
I love the app but the only thing i wish we could do is change the color at the top. Otherwise dam near perfect
Like the new update with $10 and below deals, but when I access the menu to go back I can’t see the option and the interaction menu at the top does not work.
No way to turn off one-click. No way to turn off one-click. No way to turn off one-click. No way to turn off one-click.
Why in God's name, after all this time, can I still not see photos attached to reviews??? This is easy on the phone, more difficult on the laptop, and non-existent on on iPad. Come on. You've had enough time!!
Literally loved this app until a few months ago. The app requires to enter password OR to use your Touch ID to either review past and recent orders, and to make purchases. As others have stated it does not work and says “an error has occurred”.   To make it more irritating every item I had in my “save for later” has completely disappeared. So I had to relocate things and just put them in my cart when I was ready to buy or having it sit in my cart until I can get to a computer. It won’t even link up and show when I go from the app to the computer either it turns out. 
The app is becoming ever more cluttered with useless information and recommendations. Between these and the obtrusive Dash buttons, it is cumbersome to work through the app and difficult to do so without inadvertently touching unnecessary links.  Please clean this up. Your customers are loyal enough that there is not a need to force feed them with unwanted information and images. 
Whisper automatically redirects me here repeatedly to give you a poor rating. Just following through with what feels right at this point. Stop constantly redirecting me here and my review may change.
But please make it easier to find your wishlists...
I can’t believe after all these years apps original to the app markets would be this problematic. First I cannot get the reviews to switch from top reviews, which are almost 3 years old and no longer relevant to latest reviews. I have also noticed glitches in the account end. Alexa needs a rest try going back to basics.
I created a return, and just prior to SUBMIT, I chose “add additional items to this return”. It provides a list of all purchases, but nothing happens when I select another item: no reason for return pops up. Eventually I  selected a few more items for return, but now I’m frozen in Return order land, and there is no way out besides closing out of the app. Which means I have to start over.
If I filter by size when searching for shoes, it shows the item prices as a range instead of showing the exact price for the size I filtered. For me, this makes it almost impossible to find a shoe.
This app has so many issues. The most annoying is when you try to review one of your purchases and are denied because it allows only "verified purchases" reviews. And yet you're trying to submit it from your purchase!! Horrible app.
👎 this product need more knowledge and work to it.  It needs more varieties of things also
Every time this app gets updated something goes wrong. The latest version won’t let me log in. I can log in on the website so I know I’m using the right password. So frustrating and annoying  Also please restore the option to filter your wishlist for items with price drops. I buy a lot more when I can find the sale items
By apps like whisper.  Makes me want to delete them all.
No complaints. I’ll change to 5 stars if you come out with IOS Smart Invert (Dark Mode) support :)
It’s crap because every time I order something and I go out of the app then come back it’s gone so I have to re order it and stay on the app
If I wanted dash buttons, I would purchase one. I don’t need dash buttons built into the app- if you must add dash buttons in the app. At least give me an option to disable your gimmicks. Thanks.
For the past 3 weeks I have been having problems with this app. Just about every time I try to get on the app it tells me “uh-oh something went wrong with amazon go back to amazon Home” and I’ll click the amazon home button and it says “uh-oh something went wrong with the amazon app” and it won’t work. So I get off clear it out and try again and it says the same thing. I’m so sick of it. I order a lot of stuff off of here and I can’t now. I haven’t been able to in a while and when it does decide to let me look I add stuff to my cart and get off because I have something else to do and I try to go back and get on it later and I can’t. THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED ASAP. Thanks
It is working as expected, but you guys has to add new option to amazon. As I see many fake reviews or reviews not for the same item so you should add to report other selection menu so users cam report. We got lost with the reviews as we have to read all the reviews they be sure it is not fake or for other item. Solve this issue please
I cant view picture from review section
I've been scammed twice now on this app for 50 dollars that I wish I could have back. If you want to save money, use a different online shopping app.
Returns are broken, and have been for a while now. When you select a return and need to add more items to it, the list of items you can return pops up from the bottom. After selecting the other item to return, you cannot scroll the list back to the top to hide it and proceed, and there's no button at the bottom of the list allowing you to proceed. You are essentially stuck and have to force quit the app in order to do anything else…
When I try to scroll down the page in the daily deals, the page will automatically scroll back up a few items making it very frustrating to keep my place.
I thought it was great you could by literally anything but the one thing i cant stand is that there is no option to minimize the wish list
I thought the app for the iPhone was kind of terrible, but then I started using the app on the iPad and it’s the absolute WORST. I decided to go with Amazon for my baby registry because everyone shops on Amazon anyway, but boy was I mislead. First of all, navigating to my registry is a total pain in the a**. I shouldn’t have to click on a million different things to get to my registry, there should be one button conveniently located as soon as I open the app. Once I’m on my registry (on my iPad) I can’t even edit it because the formatting is all messed up... I’m forced to try again on my iPhone, or if that’s not working I have to go sit at my desktop, which seems really archaic for a company that’s basically ruling the world. People have told me that it’s been very difficult for them to even find where to search for my registry...this shouldn’t be happening! This all made me set up another registry where it lets me directly link to my Amazon registry. What a total unnecessary pain. C’mon Amazon, get with it. Remember when you only sold text books to college students? Those were the days...maybe you should go back to your roots.
At first I thought this app was nice but now after spending five minutes of my day getting frustrated trying to get it to multi-task I have learned that it was poorly designed and Amazon clearly thinks they are special by not allowing users to split screen the app intentionally.  Are they afraid people will split screen with Safari or other browsers to price compare and buy elsewhere?  I cannot think of any other reason for now allowing this feature.    Amazon....Fix the app and enable the features that people expect on an iPad. 
Why Am I Paying For Prime If Your Still Going To Flood My App With Add(s) Some Adds Are Now Autoplay Videos. Not Okay. I Can Understand To Show Adds To Regular Non Prime Members. But Don’t Penny Pitch On Your Loyal Prime Customers. 
Can you please fix the shopping car in the iPhone app. When yo pull down to view your cart, the app jumps over items and you miss them.  I don’t need recommendations in my cart.  Thx 
FYI.. prime customer for years, and have bought $thousands in products ..but I HATE THIS NEW APP CHECKOUT CART!    I just want to check-out!!!!!  I don’t need to see my wishlist or previously purchased lists completely!   Minimize that crap and give me suggestions if you must.. but tone this endless page of crap down!! 
I use the most recent reviews feature a LOT when purchasing and I am unable to do so using the amazon app. I have to exit it, go back to the product I was viewing and then I’ll be able to receive the option to sort by most recent. A lot of unnecessary work
Are you serious? You have an entirely separate cart for rentals and no button to immediately access it. I’ve only been able to find it on my computer.
What's up with the ads on the home page? I get it if stores are promoting their Amazon sold products but do we need Geico ads and ads to buy tickets to movies now? Get these off of here.
Can’t add things to cart in fresh without crashing the whole app.
Gift options only work every now and then. The cart is always jacking up. Address section will not stay updated and it sent my stuff to an old address I had removed. 1 out of every 3 uses this clunky app messes up. Not worth the “ease”.
Your app is ok. The wishlist tray needs to go away.   But I want to leave feedback on Amazon... I can’t do it on the website, I can’t do it in the app, I called once and they say d they took my feedback and would enter it in their system for management. I asked do a copy... but that is against policy.   So we, as consumers:  1. have no voice over 3rd parties 2. Can’t complain against Amazon  3. Have to watch bots buy up new releases and then resell for 3-5 times the price (I’m pretty sure Amazon is getting kickbacks) 4. But... the people you do actually talk to are nice. 
A lot of functionality is broken. I can’t even buy things in my cart... it keeps asking me to select a shipping address. Just one of many major bugs.  Usually amazon is better... on iPhone X FYI. 
What is that? How can this app be created with such a narrow-minded focus as to miss the ability to buy?
I love amazon and use it multiple times a week to online browse and order whatever (batteries, vitamins, gifts, etc..), but recently the cart (save for later) has this weird thing that makes viewing my saved items impossible.  When you scroll down the app wants to show you “other items” similar to what you have saved, but all it does is refresh my screen and make it where I can’t ever scroll down!  Infuriating!  Also, not a fan of that wish list pop up tray at the bottom either.  Just takes up room and it’s not needed. 
About half of the time for the past few months, every time I try to use the app to view my past orders or change my subscribe and save, a “something went wrong” notification comes up. The app is basically useless half the time.
I love Amazon it is like the best app in the whole entire world I do Christmas shopping on it and I'm fine really expensive stuff a really low prices
Please five the option to increase the type size since it’s hard to read those tiny descriptions thanks
While browsing for books, I can choose paperback, hardcover, or audio, and I am given a choice to ‘Add to cart’, but as soon as choose kindle, the only choice is download sample. Doesn’t make sense.
This wish list that pops up is so unnecessary.  I plain out hate it every time Im scrolling down and just happen to hold it for just a second too long for that thing to pop up.   Next thing I know, I dragging this item I have no interests in, knowing that if I let it go it will automatically be added to the “wish list”.  I’m already addicted to online shopping, I don’t need any extra help adding “wish list” to my well organized catalog of lists.  And to be clear, aren’t all lists technically a wish list.  If you could buy them that instant you wouldn’t need a list to begin with.   Redundant , just plain redundant. 
Amazon, you realize that login inside the app has been broken forna really long time, right? I can't change password, change treasure truck location, etc? Anything that requires a password, I get a "something went wrong, please try again" message after submitting password and then the page reloads withoit completing whatever I was attempting to do. It's been like this for many app revisions.
Wonderfully crafted app; from the speed, the layout, the usability, support contacts; it’s just easy to pick up and go. However, with that being said, I would love to see two new features; Dark/Light Themes, and Collapsible Sections.   The option to go between “Dark/Light themes” would be a glorious addition for those midnight “I forgot to buy ______!” epiphanies, or shopping for your best friend’s birthday party while in the middle of a luncheon in the park.  The “Collapsible Sections” would free up much unnecessary scrolling through an item’s page, and you can expand or collapse what you deem it’s important to you. I would love to have this feature apply to the following sections:  - Frequently Bought Together - Sponsored products related to this item - Compare to similar items - Have a question? - About this item - Related Video Shorts (when applicable) - Customers who bought this also bought - Customer Questions - Customer reviews - Sponsored products related to this item - What do customers buy after viewing this item? - Customers who viewed this also viewed  This option would save on load times, data usage since all those videos and images would be hidden, and would make each item page much cleaner-looking.   This idea could lead to or evolve into a Table of Contents instead; Open the Table, click on your desired item, say, Customer Reviews, and it would take you there AND expand it for you!  I’m not sure how difficult or tedious it would be to incorporate these features, but they would be, in my opinion, amazingly welcomed additions to an already stellar app!  Thanks again, Amazon team! 
Whenever I access the My Orders screen (and even at some random times), it asks me to confirm my password, even if I already am signed in. I understand the security, but it should only need it once for when I open the app. If I'm checking multiple orders, I will have to enter my password upwards of ten times. Intrusive and ridiculous. Pretty decent app otherwise. Would be better with fixing this issue, and allowing the viewing of sub-departments as online. e.g. Electronics>Tablets>iPads. This is possible to find, but not easy.
We all know Amazon. By now we all know how it works. Some of us will use all the Prime Member features and others may just use the free shipping. Quit prompting me and reminding me what I’m not using. I know this works. It does work seamlessly between the app on my iPhone, iPad and my PC. That’s a good thing. The problem lies in the format of the app on the iPhone, iPad and then PC. Not much consistency. So you have to get used to 3 different layouts and interactions. I dislike the wishlist on the bottom of the iPhone app. Takes up valuable real estate. Fine on the iPad but why can’t we have it on the PC? Maybe you can but I have never been able to figure it out. How about a color overall? I’m tired of looking at the green blue color by now on the iPhone app. I believe last year for the cyber Monday sales it was easy to find the deals quickly including upcoming etc. This year it almost took a Herculean task to find anything other than what Amazon was pushing. I hate how the Subscription service is done. Every item is a separate order, why can’t you assign a separate number for the Subscription? For business purposes it would be nice to have a breakdown of shipping savings either per item or per order? I’m sure that would allow us to figure out that they probably pay zero in shipping. Amazon loads up the website I wish they would load the app. It seems at times, the app has its limitations. Every other app allows you in some way to be customize, but it sure would be nice to allow the customer to do that with this app to be able to see what we want. I have so many other ideas but I’m tired of typing. Amazon don’t worry we will still be here!
Needs a button on the top boarder of the app the copies the link to the product you are looking at.
So far the starting page is good has easy to navigate, but it does need some love in the comment section with better flow of people personal image been shown it feel so old trying to view them wish it would be more sliding and reading review of the image that was uploaded but the user.   Also if there can be a butting for same day pick up items that would be amazing. Yes there is prime button but that 2day shipping what if need it soon or something. But so far it’s good and I have any issues with the app. 
I’ve looked far and wide in the app for the textbook rentals I have rented so I can manage my rentals, but have yet to find it. I’m currently stuck because my computer and printer won’t communicate and I need to return a book by the 19th. After a few days of trying to sort out the issue, I tried again to find my rentals on the app to no avail. Why can’t we find that in the app!!??
I use this app daily and for the most part it’s great and easy to use. What I’m not a fan of and gets more annoying everyday is the recommendations of things to buy that over power the items in my cart when I’m scrolling through it. It’s getting as bad as Facebook. I appreciate the recommendations but the manner in which they appear is discouraging and I can’t find an option to disable it!
If you want to buy a product and have no issues the app is great. Trying to find seller info, FAQ for anything other than basics is non existent. Still need to go to computer so app is only half helpful
I want more detail from external apps.  I can’t copy the tracking number at all.  IphoneX
This is stupid, I do not see any way to look up the wish lists of other people on Amazon mobile app
Keeps saying there’s an error preventing me from seeing my wish list or even place orders from mobile.
There is no back button on items with multiple deals/ pricing. If you clicking a deal to save on a brand of products, you end with no way out of the product brand page.
It’s on by default. All the links that LOOK as if they’ll allow me to disable it turn out to be dead ends in some way.
App makes you enter password too many often. My high security password is too long to enter as frequently as the app wants. Add Touch ID and join the rest of the world.
Every time I click on “done” after I’ve changed the size and/or color it never goes back to the screen to review the item. It is as if it freezes on that screen. It is so frustrating.
Lately this app has been annoyingly glitchy. When trying to order a product and change the shipping address, it doesn’t let you and glitches back to the order screen. Also, when trying to view your orders it consistently asks me for the password and a pop up notification appears saying it is unavailable right now?   This app has worked great before. Please fix these issues. 
App needs controls where you can return to previous pages without starting from the home page everytime
It’s super fun trying to click on recommendations when your saved list keeps refreshing.  And I gave up on “new and interesting finds” bc every time I see one I like, I click on it and the item I was interested in is nowhere to be found.  So basically clickbait. No thx. 
Why in the world is it so hard to copy the tracking number from this app?  When viewing the tracking info pop-up, that little "x" on the top right doesn't work. You have to press outside the window, anywhere but the x, and the tracking pop-up window closes.  Please allow us to copy the tracking number from the app. Allow it to be selectable, can't even highlight the tracking number.. 
Haven’t been able to look at my orders on this app in over a year and I can’t look at anything in my account other than my default wishlist. I have to use my mobile browser to Amazon which makes this app useless.
The last update introduced a bug that asks users to log in when they ARE ALREADY LOGGED IN. This happens most often when trying to look at my orders, and is SUPER ANNOYING. It is also super annoying that the default is to "show password".  Should be the opposite, for security reasons.  PLEASE FIX.  This app is essential for shoppers, so I am not sure why the back button disappeared several updates ago in orders and has been MIA ever since.  Now, when you go to page 2 or 3 (or 14!) you have to go all the way to bottom to select prev page, etc.  Ideally, page selection would be BOTH at top and bottom, but minimally there should be a back button at the top the way it used to be.  Very clunky to have to go to bottom every time. 
I hate the new track shipping screen. On the iPhone X you can’t copy the tracking numbers or use the share sheets for my Deliveries App. Please go back to the old way!!
Developers, using the app to purchase or rent ebooks through the app doesn’t work. When you click the buy option I can select paperback and checkout but I can’t do so using ebooks.
The color scheme teal is hideous. And also the wish list tray is annoying.
The app constantly doubles the items I have in my “saved for later” every time the app loads older items in said list.
You can only swap from left to right to go back on certain instances. It should be the default through the entire app and not that back arrow in the upper left side
I love Amazon but for a billion dollar company this app is not even close to perfect. Too SLOW to remove or add to cart. Another annoying issue is that items start to duplicate while scrolling through your list! I don’t get how time consuming it is to delete items. So frustrating!!!
I love Amazon. I obsessively check the deals of the day on my app, check my wish lists for price drops, and do a lot of browsing regularly. But there are two issues I have with this app.   First, anyone with access to my phone can open the app at any time and see my purchase history. I do most of my gift shopping on this app and I’d like to keep the element of surprise. Requiring a password to view purchase history would easily solve this issue.   Second, I don’t have control over what appears on the home screen. So any item I’ve looked at recently or added to a wish list could be on the home screen. Which brings me back to the first issue. Adding an option to dismiss items on the home screen would solve this problem.   I’d much rather have the app be fined tuned than get the needless addition of social features (Spark! Because you need strangers asking you which camera or scarf they should buy).   I do like the new addition of notifications though. That’s a step in the right direction. 
I don’t know who’s genius idea it was to clutter up your saved items with other items to look at but this is beyond annoying when trying to scroll .Makes me want to delete the app!!!
It is getting really annoying to see countless pop ups of today's deals! Also, I never get notifications of when my item(s) are shipped and/or delivered anymo

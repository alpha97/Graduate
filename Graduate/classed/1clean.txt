Why can’t anyone from support tell me how to disable this “Deliver to” banner that now displays under the search bar and on EVERY product screen I visit. When you click on it, it says “Choose your delivery location” but never goes away! Tell me how to disable!!!
Great app with anything you need. Sometimes with outrageous pricing but that is the suppliers fault. If for some reason you need some gum in the next day or two just press a couple of buttons and it’s shipped to your door with fancy tape and what not.
App is not working form me, as soon as I click on an item all I get is a blank flashing screen! As much as you charge me for prime and music I should have no issues. Because of this, I am seriously thinking about canceling! Shipping is never one time , you couldn’t even get a gift card to someone in the expected time!
You can no longer view buyer/seller messages, or other messages for that matter. I just went through every menu item and there are nowhere to be found! How stupid is that? Argh!! Bring it back!!!
App now (for some reason) now has a bar at the top showing my name and address!!! Why?!?!? Cant get rid of it and don't want anyone seeing it! Please get rid of this terrible feature!!!!!
I have prime membership and every time I order something they tell me my order is being delayed. I call customer service to find out why and I get a huge run around and a bunch of excuses of why and not one of them make any sense. They tell me it might say 2 day but that’s not true and they ship it however the fulfillment center wants to no matter if 2 day overnight or what ever shipping someone pics. I will not recommend amazon or this app to anyone.
One star for reeling me in to get the app with a $5.00 gift card and then never sending it to me.  After reading the reviews, it’s not a far stretch to just delete it.
Why pay $100 a year for 2-day shipping when it’s a gamble whether or not you actually receive 2-day shipping? If it’s not going to ship in the amount of time that you pay for, why not just disclose that! I am incredibly irritated, as I ordered something Thursday only because the app claimed it would be here yesterday. I NEEDED a broken piece of my breast pump for work today. If I had known it wouldn’t arrive till the FOLLOWING WEEK (even though the item advertised WILL ARRIVE BY SATURDAY), I would have just spent the extra money and bought it at the store when I had the chance. However, I had no updates saying the order would be late. I returned home last night with no order and the tracking says it won’t arrive till next week. I am currently at work in a lot of pain because my pump will not work without it. See if I pay for my membership next time around!
You know what this review is about Amazon. Fix this issue. Let us know where you stand.
I’ve been an Amazon Prime for years. I use this app all day, every day; just because I’m addictive to it; but lately, most of the time I add an item to my cart, I get this error message that says “Amazon encountered a problem”. That’s the only reason I took a star away. LOVE AMAZON ❤️❤️❤️
Prime shipping is rarely delivered 2 day shipping any more. Customer service has promised my a $30 credit twice because of week overdue orders and never fulfilled they’re promise. Amazon Primevis not what it used to be.
Anyone with access to an unlocked iPad can make a purchase. On the iPhone, when “biometric authorization” is turned on, touch ID is required for purchase.   Also on the iPad, the the ability to email support is broken, except about the predefined topics. On the iPhone, tapping “other” a few times let you write a free-form email. 
Amazon raised PRIME withholding all explanations for unrealistic increases to their customers....Bad Plan  SHIPPING WITH FedEx... Strike TWO! FedEx under investigation for ILLEGAL SHIPPING OF SHARKFIN DOLPHINS ORCA et.al..  TRACKING feature has now been disabled vs before which DIRECTLY LINKED US TO OFFICIAL SHIPPERS TRACKING WEBSITE  ...fin....  Failure in all aspects of operations testing combined with;  Unwillingness to adhere to: ‘the NUMBER 1 Rule of Business’, will result in Amazon being Bankrupt by JUNE 2018. DrDi 
Amazon’s customer service and the way they handle their business is the best I’ve ever encountered.
This was one of my favorite apps, and I love Amazon. But it’s simply not working anymore. Not in my iphone 6 or my ipad mini. It stays “still loading” and never finishes.
I’ve been a prime member for a while now and just today i cancel it cause its crap. My orders never on time as they claim the 2-day delivery and its always late. Every-time i call customer service they just say sorry and they will look into it. So if you think Amazon is fast. Think again.
I stared using Amazon for shopping only recently but have truly been delighted with both the selection and prices.  Their shipping is reasonable and gets there fairly close to expected times. I am very happy with this company.
3rd party international sellers should be separated from domestic sellers. They are a pain to deal with and the customer shouldn’t even have to question whether they are purchasing from an international seller unless they navigate to a section that clearly states international 3rd party. I’m sure amazon customer service spend unneeded time to get things resolved with these sellers.
For a company that does trillions of dollars in business in the US they can't provide customer service reps that speak coherent English.
I was guaranteed delivery by 8pm today. Amazon said it was delivered at my door when it was not. I’ve been home so I would have seen it. Checked with my neighbors and no package. Can’t request a refund until tomorrow at 4pm. What’s the point of Amazon Prime?
Amazon has really bad customer service the supervisor Pau is the worst customer customer person they have. Don’t have a clue what Customer service mean. Fix the problem don’t make it worse for the customer. It need to get fired. To the CEO of the company need to get of  Pau from Customer service supervisor in Amazon. Want to bring your rating up start with that person in customer service supervisor Pau
I’ve been using amazon for a while and it was great with prime deliveries, but now 75% of the time I’m supposed to get my package within 2-3 days, it gets delayed another week.
I use amazon a lot, I really mean a LOT. With that said prime has let me down a lot too, getting worse too. Forget the delivery date they give you, missing more and more of those target dates lately. And while we are at it did you realize that some bad reviews on products they will not let you post, like getting obviously used poorly repackaged items sold as new???? Yea tried to post that twice and they wouldn’t let me warn others. Overall I’m seen using them, just highly disappointed in their delivery promises and their unwillingness to post negative reviews. 
Abysmal!!! Worst app I’ve had to use by a great company I just don’t get it. I just ordered something and it doesn’t take and I can’t see them in “Your Orders” but I get an email for them?
I am extremely addicted to this app. Even when i am not ordering love to store things in my wish list. Or even create folders of different wishes i want. Especially with this new update amazon provided us for the use of this app has been a great positive change.
Application is good, works well and easy to use. But i want an option to choose what shipping carrier service i want to use: FedEx is better for my country and UPS is the worst one, DHL is average and usually give me some trouble and so on. In this case, i prefer to use FedEx but there is no choice.  There is also one problem: users cannot use “Contact Us” menu from the application to chat to customer service (must be done through desktop computer).  Thanks 
There’s no way to turn off annoying promotional notifications Amazon insists on showing me for products I will never buy. So I’m uninstalling this app. Email notifications are all I need anyway.
I’ve recently placed a couple orders these past few months and I am a prime member. I pay the extra couple bucks for one day shipping and the package never comes what is the point of next day shipping if they never deliver on time?
THREE times now, I’ve ordered something from amazon to arrive at my school in Nashville but for some reason, Amazon keeps thinking I’m sending it to my house in Maine. I explicitly choose my Nashville address every time but regardless it arrives in Maine 2 days later. Im so freaking tired of this.
This has been a long time frustration...there’s no discernible way to connect the app to my smile.amazon account. Three stars as a result.
Annoying issue where you’ll search for something and it’ll say “no results.” This occurs when searching for non-brand name items. Quite frustrating.
I got a new I phone. And tried to access my Amazon account. Could not do it, and the only me option available to was to set up a new account which I did. That gave me access to service or I should say nonservice. This should be a no brained.  My full name is unique as due to family name change I'm the only one on planet Earth.  One man added a second "S" in 1792. With the use of my updated genealogy I can find any Sharpless in existence. There are three Stephen's, but only one with the middle initial "H". DO AN ALPHA SEARCH AND RESTORE MY ACCOUNT
I purchased a 23 and me dna kit from an amazon seller for $156 and after sending my sample to the 23 and me company they emailed me to let me know my sample kit had been destroyed because it was originally purchased from the 23 and me web site with a stolen credit card by the amazon seller who then sold the kit to me, I reported it immediately to amazon and they found that it was not their fault that a seller that they backed had sold me a $156 useless product and thus I wasn’t due any money back, I was cheated by the seller and amazon, cheated out of hard earned money because they allowed a seller to sell stolen items, so BUYERS BEWARE OF AMAZON AND THEIR FAULTY A TO Z CHEAT PEOPLE OUT OF MONEY GUARANTEE
If u need it "fine-fast-& foolproof" AMAZON is ur  #1 "GO TO" guy!  Their quality vendors, impeccable merchandise & services, & ultra-speedy delivery r 2nd to NO ONE. My brother, BRADFORD, is often referred to as the "AMAZON KING." Thank U Amazon 4 being THE BEST.
The app is okay for shopping, but completely useless if you are trying to contact support. The chat interface is so broken that you cannot even select the text field to enter anything.
The amazon app used to be a wonderful thing. I am not a “prime” member and I have been seeing a lot of issues with that. I feel like amazon is trying to force me into a membership. I have come across several items that I couldn’t buy because I wasn’t a “prime” member. I have also placed several orders in the last couple of months that have either never showed up or the delivery date has been pushed back by another week. This is starting to occur more and more often. I am disappointed in the way amazon is treating non “prime” members.
I ordered some pre-workout mixes purely because it was on sale for one day only. Then my package got lost. I understand, not Amazon’s fault and I’m not upset that it got lost. But my only option is to now get a refund. I don’t want a refund!! I want my items but now to get it would have to pay 40% more. Terrible service.
Guaranteed delivery times seem to have no meaning whatsoever. It’s like there’s no guarantee whatsoever. App freezes a lot. Customer service slow.
You could use amazon to get things instead of going to the store. It’s just shopping from home. If you love shopping like me you have to get this app!! except my little sister once ordered a fingerling (a tiny monkey toy that plays on your finger) and when it came it had a red glowing light on the stomach  and looked like a McDonald’s toy so my mom called and they gave her her money back so you’re probably going to want to see what your getting.  P.S - my sister finally got a fingerling for Christmas. 
Shop here everyday! Great app great company!!! #PrimeMember
Very good app and amazon the best goods and services of online marketing and shopping thanks for all teams in amazon
This isn’t the 1st time I’ve had an issue with Amazon & not getting my products. They have changed to protecting their sellers more than their customers! Think before you buy anymore.
Amazon no longer has free return shipping? Their prices also aren't the cheapest. There really in no incentive to shop on Amazon vs other major retailers. If I buy a product I don't like, depending on the price, I lose more then half my investment if I want to return it. Even if the product is damaged, I still have to pay return shipping. You also never know exactly what your going to get from the picture/description. I've always praised their customer service but in past months they have been willing to help. Products I have ordered from them have arrived damaged, late, or not shown up at all. I no longer associate the Amazon brand with good customer service, low prices, or efficiently.
Too many one click order buttons!I made a few orders which I did not intended to, because I clicked the buttons by mistake, or I didn’t know it would lead to an actual order without any further confirmation. I did not know I placed the orders until I tried to check my other orders’ statues, and sometimes it’s too late to cancel the wrong order
Amazon. I love your shopping choice. However I pay you every year to be a prime member for 2 day free shipping. And recently this has been hit or miss. I have a message saying if I order in the next 14 hours I get it by x day (2 days from now) and half the time now I don’t get it by x day. I’m lucky to get it a day after that. And I don’t live out in the middle of no where. I live in a decently populated area. So for that I am rating them and their app a 3 star because the choice is awesome. But it lies to me... :/
I had a problem with connecting to internet but seems like its apple id issue. Love the 2 day shipping.
I can’t review products unless I spend $50 on a valid credit/debit card? Gift cards and my amazon store card (that I’ve had for 8 years doesn’t count)? This is THE dumbest thing I’ve ever heard of. I should be able to share my opinion about products no matter how I purchased them!!
all versions didn’t show the full price with tax and shipping costs on the last step  i talked to customer service and they told that i’m right and we will fix the issue   still now not fix 
I spent waiting for my phone calls twice over 2 hours. I asked for phone call now. Disgusted I used the chat room and got the best service ever. Resolved my problem in ten minutes. I’m going to use them from now on. The letter from amazon was too long and sorry was not enough.
Got ahold of one person was told I was getting a refund for a shirt I never received. Got an email the next day explaining my refund and how it would take 3-5 business days for it to show in my account. They filed a claim for something I haven’t even opened yet. Then I message customer service and explain I’m getting refunded for the wrong things-not fair to that company to take a hit-and the customer service person tells me it’s a “third party” problem and he’s sending me a link to file a claim. I tell him he needs to take care of it, it’s their responsibility. Low and behold in the email it says to get ahold of Amazon’s customer service department for help to file the claim. Very poor customer service for people who order off of amazon all the time
The CALL ME feature loops and starts over vs initiate a call. Your artificial intelligence on chat can not understand call me. It also does NOT recognize a phone number when it asks for a number.  Your app turned on Prime Pantry... I did NOT.  As a consequence I cannot place an order because it wants me to order hundreds for a grocery order, I guess. Your app pops a welcome line at the top of the page. This drops the app down the page. You cannot scroll down to CUSTOMER SERVICE, because it is now off the screen because your app places a welcome message at the top.
I’m tired of finding knock-off items with bogus reviews.   Amazon, you need to do something about this NOW.   ALSO. Fix the notifications. Why is there always 1 notification that won’t go away. 
The latest update’s call me now button doesn’t work. Every time I click it, it just keeps looping back to the selection of questions as to why I am calling. Very irritating!
If I could give a 0 Star I would! This new app is horrible every time I try to sign in it states sorry something went wrong! I’m fixing to do away with Amazon and their Prime that really is a joke to begin with
Please calibrate customer service chat for iPhone X. It was very frustrating trying to send a message, but needing to click above the box for it to actually work. Other than that, the app is great!
I’ve never written a review here on the App Store but I just wanted to say that whoever came up with the idea to add a little map in ‘track your package’ and give you real-time updates on your delivery is a genius. Best feature ever!
The new format is okay with one exception...NO MORE BROWSING HISTORY!!! I’m a 60 year old person that more and more often need to be reminded of the things that inspire me. With no option to look at my long time history, I find that my purchasing intentions are severely blocked. BRING BACK THE HISTORY OPTIONS!!!
I do not like that you have to pay for shipping the item back I had to pay $6.00 for shipping it back and that’s exactly what I paid for it so what’s the whole point on returning something if u DO NOT like either way your not getting your whole money back and before it used to be free to return something back but now I DO NOT LIKE AMAZON because of that reason now I am not getting my money back because that’s what it costs for shipping 😡😡😡☹️☹️
Amazon is really good but why it doesn't send things to the iran,it send things to everywhere except iran,that's the only bad point.😭
Purchased something with prime membership, selected the two day prime membership shipping, received the package four days later. Cancelling prime.
Amazon has been horrible to me! This app has been a nightmare!  I have been removed for “unexplained “ violations or breaking “community guidelines “ that NO ONE FROM AMAZON can seem to explain....  They also pulled over 1/2 of my reviews...  Thanks Amazon! 
All of my orders so far have been delivered as promised and in optimal condition. For the 1st time the other day I reached out to Amazon online re. a question/concern. Rep answered immediately via chat, solved my issue, and was very professional and courteous. Definitely more pleasant than some of my “in store” shopping experiences!!
Sometimes looking for things that you may think are in just about any store or not anymore there online.Amazon is uber-cool ever since shopping online was the power move! Pioneers at it. Once searching for a case for my iPhone SE. They had plenty of topnotch Cases an screan protection at Amazons ridiculous prices, Nuff said.
(January 30th 2018 i’am adding to this review)  IAM DONE BUYING FROM THEM! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE Amazon gave me a fake tracking number for my package, lied about it when I emailed them, took a month to receive the item, fake tracking on the package doesn’t say who it came from AND VERY SHADY THAT I CANT MESSAGE THE SELLER!  Amazon always removes my reviews that are less than 4 or 5 stars or hides them when they are verified! so you cant see the real reviews, it’s NOW January 26th 2018 still cannot write a review for a product I PAID for they only “approve” reviews that are 4/5 stars and the ones that are paid “I got sent this product for free” = 5 star review 
Window shopping!!!! Didn’t have a chance to purchase them!!! And I got destroyed by your... messing my phone device.... cost me  my phone!!!   Thanks
Order tracking seems glitchy two items I ordered have been delivered to my house and I have them but amazon says they are still being shipped and two of my orders that are being shipped haven’t had the tracking updated for five days which is weird I mean that’s basically saying it’s gone nowhere in five days
I love amazon, and this app is great it has everything you need all in this app
Need someone to talk or email someone. Can’t sign in
No price sort  Hard to hind things Expensive overpriced Small verity. 
First let me say that being a Prime Member is by far the best part of Amazon. Besides getting two day deliveries and watching Prime Movies these two things is what keeps me coming back to the Amazon App.   Now for the downside. I have the IPhone 7 Plus and the last few months I noticed a #1 in a Red Circle which is very noticeable when you are looking at your phone. I called Amazon Customer Service and spoke with their technicians but all they can tell me was to delete the app and reinstall it. I did just that and even shut my phone off to reboot the phone and when I went to the App Store I reinstalled the Amazon App and the #1 is still there.   If anyone who reads this thinks they know what this might be please get in touch with me.   Picture this, when you have new mail or on Facebook if you have new Messages you will have a # on your App. This is what I have on the Amazon App.   Thank you Howard Krulik 
When I called to get an explanation I got circular arguments that made no sense and unfortunately turned a 5 star app into trash.
The tracking info is very on-point and is very accurate! Most of the time it arrives earlier than expected!
Hybrid apps consistently offer a slow, brittle, tap-twice-for-everything experience and Amazon is no different, despite having more than enough cash for native. Good game nice hustle
New format is a step in the wrong direction
Same day delivery is such a marketing sham . I have never got the stuff delivered on the same day inspite of so many attempts  It’s 2018 and your app still looks so old. It works all the time and that is it . 
So my mail carrier is awful (USPS) and they lost my most recent package, they showed it as delivered but it never arrived, I waited 2 days and it still never showed. So I sent an email to amazon customer service and they were very quick to respond with an apology email (not their fault what happened) and within 3 hours I had the refund in my checking, I switched to amazon prime where they use ups for the 2 day shipping. Great customer service!
Hands down Amazon is my favorite app on my phone. I am browsing on amazon or making a purchase at least 4 days a week. I love that I can efficiently find what I’m looking for and receive it the next day! Amazon is hands down my favorite place to shop! Their customer service is impeccable! They are kind, funny and most importantly AMAZING at their jobs!
Doesn’t send notifications about delivery status like it says it would.
I love the app, never had any problems. I’m on amazon all the time. But I have to give a special shout out to the delivery peeps lately!! My last few packages have been concealed for me!! One behind a potted plant and another under the front door mat. Not to mention the delivery photos just to verify, I love it! Gotta keep loving me some Amazon!!!
I had issues with the app for a long while despite it’s up to date. Issues such as it keeps saying “loading...” when viewing account or scanning gift cards. After I deleted it and reinstalled it, it works again. I also noticed the navigation interface had changed also. So be aware that App Update doesn’t always work. You will have to manually delete the app and reinstall it. 1 star less for this glitch.
This app is terrible I ordered a package they was supposed to come on the 22 and it was a week late. Horrible app, and it’s also very slow
I don’t understand why Amazon only has 3 stars, it deserves at least 4. (I give it a 5). If you’re a student, it’s only 50 dollars a year. You cannot beat that. Free 2 day shipping from soooo many sellers, and competitive and affordable prices. Even 100 dollars a year is reasonable too. They offer incentives for choosing normal shipping, like 5 dollars towards amazon fresh(their supermarket app) or 1 dollars towards electronics(or clothes, etc.). I ordered my books for school and was offered free one day shipping at checkout. It would’ve cost me 300 dollars to buy the books, but I only payed 60 dollars by renting them.  What a relief. Thanks girl
A better and faster interface is needed, I don’t have the luxury of a laptop as of now, and when I tried buying a book, I noticed how slow it was, and it caused me to panic when I thought I bought multiple copies of the book, it ended up taking my money when I didn’t want all the books, but other than that, If it were a bit faster and easier to understand the app would be much more useful, as the site.
I get email specials from Amazon telling me a $50 item is on sale for 19.99.  They tell me it’s 70% off regular price but that regular price they quote is a lie.  Look around. You won’t find the MLMSY travel makeup bag anywhere for $50.  It’s always around $20.  So why does Amazon inflate a price to tell me they are discounting it ?  Very misleading.  Class-action lawsuit type activity.  Price fixing and mis-representing prices so you think your getting a deal
I signed up for amazon prime for the year for $99 as advertised but instead of doing what I simply asked for they deny me yearly membership without cause and decide to charge my account $130 a year instead of the advertised $99 a year. When I asked for them to fix it, all I get told is you can cancel your account and that’s all we can do for you? Like what?! Talk about good customer service... yeah NEVER again will I bother with Amazon
Impossible to access Account settings, which don’t show in the menu. I.e. cannot view Prime Membership details or payment options. I have tried to report the problem to Amazon through their feedback email/chat, and was connected to 8 representatives whose only concern is to refer me to someone else. I hope they read these reviews.
( jan 19 2018 ) - initial review: I will immediately update this review to a five star review , once items below are fixed, or at least responded to (or addressed) :  1a- (most important) - We need to be able to search reviews on the app. Only having this functionality in the web version is a palling after this after the app has been out this long (and with this if you updates in terms of frequency)  1b- (2nd most important) -  ADD LANDSCAPE MODE/ orientation!!!  1c- (3rd most important) -  overall (web+app) WHEN YOU CHNAGE OPTIONS FOR AN ITEM, ONLY AHOW REVIEWS FOR THAT SPECIFIC ITEM!  Example; let’s say a pair of pliers have two options you can choose, 8 inch for $10, or 14 inch for $21-depending on which option you choose only show reviews relevant to that option chosen. Many items will have lots of options which totally change the product, but when you click to read the reviews, (which are all which apply to all options) the reviews won’t even make sense or everyone is trying to give two stars to the 14 inch pliers but five stars to the 8 inch pliers and it’s impossible to tell which reviews apply to which option. (also sellers use this bug to boost up their review count or even worse, slip in a trash item/“options” of an item that already has high reviews , thus it looks like the high reviews apply to that trash item/option as well..)  1- Amazon needs to add a app “Feedback/suggestions” option, like 90% of other apps/services have built-in.  This way amazons “valued” users can provide constructive feedback based on real world experience/usage. This will also allow the developers to gather system logs or screenshots if users cheese just submit those in their feedback. This of course is if Amazon even cares about making this app better or listening to its customers. I’m not sure if they do or don’t.  However it’s pretty indicative of their position that app feedback has never been in the app, ever.  2- Needs to have better “share this item” icons/functionality/visibility in the app. Currently it’s a tiny little icon midway through a product page, and it’s very hard to spot and it’s functionality is poor once you tap it.  3-  there needs to be an alert me button/field where you can receive an email alert once an out of stock or unavailable item , again becomes available. This should apply to any and all items that are un-available or out of stock,. On the web version of Amazon.com *some* (few) unavailable items will give you this option, every unavailable or out of stock item should give you this option, and it must be also on the app (as of now it is totally missing from the Amazon app).  4- contact support; there needs to be the option to send a message/email/ticket to Amazon customer support in regards to an item, the only options currently our chat or receive a call back. Both of these options occupy much more time then a user may want to dedicate to resolving an issue, as opposed to being able to send an email/message/ticket to support which may take one to three minutes and you are done.  5- I like the recently added wish list at the bottom of app, that you can drag items to, however there needs to be A way you can lock that wish list so that it never changes (i.e. the list at the bottom of the app never changes unles you specifically unlock it or manually change it yourself). Often times the wish list at the bottom of the app will change or switch to another wish list I have and it takes me a while to find the wish list I was using previously as I have many (very frustrating).   (Or another option/solution, would be an iOS/app specific wish list that appears on the web also, but that you can lock as always being the wish list at the bottom of the app)  6- any and all functions or options that are available in the full blown web version of Amazon.com, on a desktop PC, should be available in the app in some form or another.  While there are several examples, one example is the lack of the ability to modify your address book within the app. ****  It is important that we app users demand more from apps and their developers, and STOP blindly throwing out five star reviews!  (except for truly exemplary apps, or when there is active weekly or monthly updates/development on the app). Users need to demand more from apps, and stop defaulting to a 5 or 4 star reviews.  These are large companies with dedicated development teams behind their app, they must learn to respect / respond to user feedback and update their app in a timely and consistent matter, based on user feedback.  We the users are the *sole* reason these companies and apps are so valuable ($), and this the developers/team should treat us accordingly and fair.  Again, I will * immediately * update this review to a five star one once these issues are fixed/addressed/reply to (I check and read app updates/change logs multiple times a week).  I will also timestamp any new review updates, and will never delete or modify prior review updates.   Thanks! 
Advertised shipping is often incorrect and takes much longer. Costumer service is not like it was and now play around with you. You guys play stupid, playing stupid games not at all what Amazon was in the beginning
TURN THIS OFF, you may buy something of high cost and not even realize it! I am not too happy>:|
I still love Amazon as a company, but they are messing up this app. I absolutely hate that they have video ads now with no option to turn off for use on cellular data. Cause I really wanna give Verizon even more money hitting data overages because I simply scrolled into a crappy ad where they dip a tube shaped cookie into some third rate Amazon-wanna-be Nutella. Yeah that’s just great. Thanks. Oh and for all the new bugs too. Thanks.
They delivered my stuff in the wrong mailbox 3 times and I don't even get a refund for their mistake
I have been waiting for the gear fidget spinner ever since March and I never got it yet and we lost some money for nothing.😡
Customer service trash. I gave amazon my address to ship directly to my house and for odd reason they sent it to another address. Bought the wrong part for my car cause it said it fit on my mustang. Bought an Alternator through amazon and it never work. And that wasn’t the last. I filed probably over 10 complaints last year and and non of them could speak English at all but the supervisor. I would never recommend nobody to amazon cause they trash overall
Apparently Amazon has decided we, the buyer, don’t count anymore. I had a hard time with the last order I placed - what should have been a simple book order turned into a pain in the butt. When I contacted the seller, they told me they would put a tracker on the package - which would have been wonderful, EXCEPT it was several more days before the package even shipped! Now, I would much prefer the TRUTH (something like “we haven’t shipped it, but we’ll still get it there by the date we said we would”) to a bald face LIE. And, personally, I’d like to warn other potential buyers. I think what some sellers are doing (probably even the one I dealt with) is they log the weigh bill into the USPS system as “this is where it’s gonna go - WHEN we get it to you,” but then don’t get it ready and send it for several days after that. Meanwhile, the customer gets all excited (wow, look at how fast they ship!), and it artificially inflates the seller’s response time. AMAZON - there should be some way you can track this sort of thing. I never did get a form to rate my order or the seller (not in the app, nor in the email), and my order took every single day possible - just barely squeaking in under the wire for “date promised.” And after having sent a request through YOU to the seller (for tracking), I would absolutely think you’d follow that up. So much for customer service.
This rating applies to Amazon’s mp3 purchases only:  Keep a thorough record of your mp3 purchases, because you’ll need it. Amazon mysteriously deletes tracks from your cloud, but doesn’t tell you. When you call customer service to see what happened, they’re more than happy to refund your account so you can go back in a repurchase them, but there missing the point: They shouldn’t be deleting the tracks in the first place, and since they deleted them, THEY should be the ones adding them back. 
Outstanding customer service and care. Good prices and super fast free delivery! THANKS! 
I bought two different products at different times from different companies. Amazon send emails both times with delays for sending it to the incorrect carrier facility. My package is 8 days overdue! Terrible service and waste of money.
Amazon is nothing more than a rip-off they think they can just take whatever money they want from you and say you authorize a purchase please nothing more than thieves the whole company is one of the biggest scams on the planet
You need to make the colors of the “add to cart” and the “one-click purchase” buttons much more different. I accidentally made a $114 purchase because of this problem. I thought I closed it before it completely loaded the page but it went through anyways. Amazon was really good a quickly responding to my refund request so that’s why I gave it 4 stars but they lost the 5th star based on the button problem.
returned this book and they won’t refund me the money for it. I’ve removed confirmation emails and tracking info for the item. Every time I talk to anyone about the situation they are extremely rude and are no help at all. Even though I have received emails from them stating the items been received they say that there is no records of me returning the items. The computer is crooked and quick to take money from my account but when the item has been returned they want to act like they can’t find the order or any history of me returning the book
Suddenly, my login works erratically. Sometimes I can login to place orders. Sometimes I can’t. Somehow there’s accidentally a double order but I never got far along enough for confirmation and now I can’t get it to let me login to cancel them.
Everyday if I open the app my cart is full of junk items (phone cases for phones that neither I nor anyone in my family has) that I would never even think of buying or looking at! I delete them but different ones get added the next day! I won’t open the app for a week and when I do it’s full of junk. It’s very creepy and I feel violated. The app is the only way I access my amazon account. I’ve changed my password multiple times but it doesn’t matter. I know my account hasn’t been hacked as no orders ever go through so it seems amazon is purposely placing these items in my cart hoping I’ll accidentally buy them! Very very shady practice. I may end up canceling prime if this continues.
Love the app. Love the quick response from developers. I use this app multiple times a day
Spend your money elsewhere. I have Prime membership for the two day shipping. I had an order that was supposed to be delivered within two days; latest day being Sunday (today when I’m writing this). Today was the second day and the deliverer just passed my house. I got a notification from Amazon saying attempt failed, but he didn’t even stop at my house! So there goes my two day shipping that I pay extra for. Customer service was no help and the best they could do was have it shipped tomorrow. I wish they would have compensated me for this inconvenience. But they were no help. Not worth giving them my money.
My order sits for a week before actually shipping and it’s never two day shipping. If your going to send it snail-mail at least get it out the door faster!
I lost 30$ cause I wasn’t using a real gmail and I had the 30$ in my account but I couldn’t by nothing  and I redeemed it on the same phone and know that I have a gmail it’s says it’s already need redeem I wasted 30$
Doesn’t even support swiping from the screen’s edge to go forward and back. Cheap, undeveloped trash!
Two day delivery is a joke. They should just call it expedited delivery and not promise two days because it hardly happens. Several orders I’ve made have taken 4 to 5 days when they’re prime promised 2 day. Right now I’m waiting on something I ordered Wednesday that originally said I would get it Sunday but now it’s saying Monday. It’s nice to get things quicker, but don’t count on it. If you need something by a certain date order it at least a week in advance.
So far a little but right after Christmas I ordered an item for two of my friends for it to say they would arrive Jan. 8.  But then 5 minutes after the orders disappeared and I did it again, and again, and again.  I waited to get to the house I’m moving in before I bought them something, I found out that amazon has been canceling my orders and I’m just asking why?  Thanks and hope for the fix
It's kind of a shell of an app.  It looks great. Does some basic things well, like loading pages, letting users make use of lists, etc... but the purchasing process is non functional.  Right before Christmas I put a few things in my cart that were "deal of the day". A couple of the items were very time sensitive.  I proceeded to the purchase part of the process and wound up on an endless loop of having to log in - over and over again.    After doing this repeatedly I still had time to purchase these time sensitive items, so I hustled and downloaded the app update. It wasn't updated... that had to be the problem, right?    Wrong.  Not to sound too dramatic here, but I, literally, stood outside in -9° because I was out shopping when this snafu was happening and I'd lose my signal inside the store I was heading into.  At any rate, the download finished, the application malfunction was not remedied.  I contacted online support, explained my problem of what happened, and their stellar customer support response was "so what is it you want me to do for you?".  Uhmmm... yah... Nothing, Amazon.  Do nothing.  I'll buy my Christmas gifts while I'm out today. I'm sure you're not losing any sleep over my, or anyone else's, consumer experience. Thanks. 🙄 
I never thought I’d like shopping on line,but amazon has made it pretty easy even for a non techy person like myself lol but it would be nice if they would automatically send a return label with purchases in case the item needs returning. But at least ya don’t have to pay shipping just take it to ups store and they do charge for a label under$2.00 but I don’t return to many items just the ones that I change my mind with.like wrong size...etc have fun shopping the Amazon
Amazon your review system is one of the main reasons I use your services! Now every time I look for an item I have some stupid Chinese POS with a high number of 5 star reviews by reviewers who only leave 5 star reviews and often they do it all on the same exact day. Amazon, if you don’t clean your review system it will be a terrible thing for you as a company!
Two day guarantee.. should mean exactly what you say... totally dissatisfied
1st did I miss a bunch of updates because the app jumped from 9.22 to 11.01??? What is up with that?  I can’t get anything in the header to recognize touch events.  It’s like you running service calls on your main thread or disabling touch interactions while waiting for asynchronous call backs. Please fix.
I have been shopping with Amazon for many years with never a glitch. Suddenly, I cannot check out. “Something went wrong.” After two customer service calls, and missing gifts for my daughter’s birthday, I am instructed to wait for an email from the team. My instructions, “wait and be patient.” So, suddenly it has occurred to me how much I depend on this company for just about everything. My girls all live far away, grandchildren as well, and I live in the middle of nowhere. So Amazon, I will be patient while you get it together so that I may once again send gifts to my family, and I will be grateful.
I shop Amazon daily - whether it’s for actual purchases or just shopping around for prices and reviews, making wishlists, etc. I almost exclusively use this app when browsing/buying from Amazon. Lately with each update, it is more and more glitchy. With the last update, the app didn’t respond to any of my touches - particularly the search bar. I couldn’t type anything.  I deleted and reinstalled, and it is only slightly better. I can shop a little before it stops responding. But hard closing and reopening over and over is beyond frustrating. For some reason the ipad app (on my somewhat ancient iPad mini 2 - works like a dream still - so what gives with the phone version of the app???)  Amazon, I have loved you and been one of your biggest fans for years - but lately the way the app works, the searches function, the VAST amount of 3rd party sellers (of very questionable quality and that mean fewer things ship Prime), and your customer service - I am disappointed in the direction you have headed. Please get back to the Amazon we all knew and loved - your progress should not make you a worse company. But... it seems to be doing exactly that.  I wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer who said: make an option to disable the wishlist tray permanently.  I use the wishlist feature but hate the tray taking up space on my phone - and having to always worry about weird things accidentally getting added to my wishlists because I held my hand too long in one spot of the screen while I was distracted with something else.  Make the app more customize-able for happier end users.  For reference, I am using a 128 gb iPhone 6+, updated to the most current iOS as of this morning. I have 2/3rds of the space free on my phone. 
Jeff Bezos  is giving Dreamers $33 million? Well goodbye amazon.  You need to help the homeless in our country and our veterans.  I loved shopping with you but not anymore.
Bezos would rather support illegal aliens than pay his employees enough to get off of gov’t assistance. What a cheapskate!
I will order something and then minutes later it will disappear! I have never had this problem before and it makes me want to delete this app and use another one instead. Also the things I already bought won't leave my orders tab and it's not enjoyable to think you ordered something twice and wasted money on something you already bought and received. I was also told I would get an email about fixing it in the next 24 hours. I didn't receive the email. This app is too much work for me to handle. other then that the products, product searches, and product filters are great.
If Jeff Bezos can create $33 million for illegal immigrants in the US to go to college he should match that for veterans and poor Americans. Especially inner city kids.   Just wow. 
Here’s an “Amazon Review!” The top portion of the latest app is not working with the latest version of iOS!!!!
I have a couple of complaints.  First a month and a half ago I purchased something for my husband’s company through Amazon using his company card.  All of a sudden it changed that card to my primary card even though I did not do that and I had a bunch on charges on that card.  I had to delete that card off of my account of which I shouldn’t have had to do. Also all of a sudden the buttons at the top of the app are not working.  I press the arrow at the top and nothing happens.  Please fix. 
Just updated 01/11/18 and now the back button does not take me back to the search list.  If you read reviews on an item and then use the back arrow in the upper left hand corner you can get back to the item description or the “main item page where you can add to cart.”  If you want to go back to the search list, good luck, the arrow does nothing. You are now stuck on that item page.  Force closed the app and even restarted the iPhone to no avail you have to search again.  I know “stuff happens” but for a large company such as amazon this is not acceptable.  I’m sure they’ll roll out another update but in the meantime I’m buying elsewhere.   Amazon prime is slowly losing it’s luster as in most cases one day shipping is never an option unless you order at like 6 AM!  The free overnight shipping with orders over $35 is a joke at least for me.  I even called Amazon about this and they assured me there is not an issue.  It never works out for me to get free overnight shipping.  Add constant price fluctuations and Amazon isn’t all it’s cracked up to be for me. 
Amazon ended up locking my account when i couldn’t confirm a card i didn’t have
Very bad messages, notifications, tools and more! Bad they can do better but it looks it’s made to fraud, delay, misguide, trouble, and much more knowing the majority of the people will not speak, talk, stand for themselves and get what they deserve, need and what is theirs after lost or win!
Overall I’m quite satisfied with the app, but most of all I love the chat feature. I had an issue with a charge for a channel subscription and after a few minutes of talking with some customer service reps, I was refunded my charge. The chat feature is awesome, especially for those of us who don’t like talking on the phone. Thanks Joshi and Abigail!
I love Amazon and its reliable, helpful, supportive team but here are the areas they need to improve:  1. After wasting time editing and/or updating my reviews, it won’t get through even after many attempts.  2. I ordered same item for the fourth time, but when I tried to update my review, I got denied because it says I’m not an “Amazon Verified Buyer/Purchaser”.  3. The viewers ranking ‘seems’ to have some flaws. It ‘seems’ to make some viewers very high even with less helpful reviews overall.   4. The question nobody had answered and are too old or not relevant anymore stays stuck on your profile. No delete option.  5. The shipping date of 10 to 14 days changed to estimated delivery of up to 21 days upon checkout.   But I’m satisfied with Amazon customer service and they are my top choice. This review is only a small matter related to their app. Amazon remains the best for me. 
I’ve been using amazon for years but unfortunately I’m deleting this app now. They changed delivery carrier from UPS to USPS and they barely meet the expected delivery days. I was a die hard amazon fan but this new shipping system doesn’t do it for me. Always a day or two late. Deleting and cancelled the membership.
When I first started ordering from Amazon in March of 2017 I was so pleased with the service, but lately, my orders are backed up, their later and later, and I’m always buying things, but I’m getting less satisfied with the business
I love the app except for one thing.  I don’t want to have to verify my stupid credit card for purchases regardless of where I choose to ship it. It makes my purchases less convenient because when I’m relaxing and shopping online, I don’t want to go get my wallet and dig out my credit card info.  My Account has a password, my credit cards have protection against fraud.  Please don’t over regulate me.  Ugh!!
Still can’t purchase kindle books in the app.  But I can purchase everything else though. 🤔  ******  Not excited about his amazon fresh. I have to pay $15 monthly. And pay more to ship if I don’t spend $50. Furthermore items are all over be place. Pantry, Prime, and Fresh. There’s no way I can spend $50 b/c items are strategically available on different platforms... which requires me to pay even more for shipping.   I recommend using a local grocery store’s delivery service instead. One place to get all of your groceries. 
There entire parent prime house hold bs is bs. If you leave a household, it locks you out of your connected account.
The new ship tracking interface is really dumb, bring back the old green bar.
I am very frustrated that I can no longer use one click on this app because it no longer allows for me to choose free shipping over $25.   I was one of Amazon’s first customers back in the early days when it was only books and I buy thousands of dollars worth of goods on here per year. And this is just LAME. I have read all the help pages and nothing works...and the chat function is a joke. No real person to chat with. Just a bot that takes you to the same useless ‘help’ pages you just read but we’re not helpful. What happened to the great customer service I used to get from this company???? 
I had ordered many, many items before using a PO Box. All of a sudden they stopped allowing me to get my items shipped there. I live in a rural area and don't get mail delivery. Talked to customer service and they were absolutely pathetic. Got switched between different people and nobody could give me a clear answer why.
I ordered something with prime and it said two days till delivery but instead it got here in seven days!!!!! Very ticked off!!! Horrible app!!!!😡
I think this app is great. Always a go to, even when I’m at a store I use it to price match.
Not happy with sellers not disclosing items are coming from China or Europe. I expect an item to ship 2-3 days after ordering and it’s over a week later then it actually ships. This does you no good when you need the item fast. Not only that, the shipping information is so uninformative it’s doesn’t help at all. All you know is shipped and delivered.
Half the time the info is wrong or incorrect and the other times barely an image to know what you are looking at. Between that and customer service, wait, sorry no customer service it’s ridiculous. I have better luck guessing then relying on amazon. Forget about 2 day prime shipping, that’s just a lovely bait and switch advertising gimmick, must be 2 days when it feels right to them.
Their customer service lack intelligence and integrity. They ask you to set up an email but it will not allow you to because your email is already in use. They give you the run around when you orders are lost. Totally rude.
I HATE it when they charge the wrong credit card. I've had to call customer service to cancel the amazon credit card numerous times and it's still an open account. I ordered something less than an hour ago, and now the app will not let me cancel it immediately even though I had a 12 hour window to have it shipped by Monday.
I have been a long-term Amazon customer and recently paid the $100 for Amazon Prime membership, primarily because of their advertised “Free 2-day shipping” with Amazon Prime. Since then, over a dozen items I’ve ordered have taken 10-15 days to arrive. The app and Amazon website are mis-leading and day things like “Ships within 2 days” but provides NO estimate of when it will arrive. I even spoke with an Amazon customer service rep (from a call center in India?) who said that the app and website DO NOT give you the estimate of when the package will arrive until after you place the order and it has been processed. If it ships and isn’t due to arrive until the 10th of the following month, you cannot cancel the order or request a refund until after the package arrives AND you reject the package AND it is received back at Amazon. Very misleading. It would be far more honest and consumer-oriented to change the app and website to give you an HONEST estimate of when the item will ARRIVE, so that you can make an informed decision of whether you want to make the purchase through Amazon or if you’d prefer to just drive to the nearest store and buy it there instead.
Amazon dropped the ball...... again. This item was guaranteed delivery, but they drug their feet shipping this out and it got delivered AFTER we left for our ski trip. I contacted them 3 times, one of those before it even shipped and got conflicting information, and they ultimately guaranteed it will arrive on time. This is becoming a trend with Amazon. 5th item in two months that missed the guaranteed date. Terrible customer service.
It prompted me to start using Face ID to access my orders, check out, settings, etc. it doesn’t work though. It always shows and error and since I can’t access settings I can’t turn it off. Really frustrating cause I constantly use this app for things I can’t go buy because of my work and school schedule. Seriously considering cancelling my Prime account because the app is no longer convenient and only causes problems.
I love amazon but I’ve been charged several times for the annual prime membership without my consent.
Either I can’t figure out how to turn off 1-step ordering or it can’t be turned off. Either can be a recipe for disaster. I had something “accidentally” ordered by my daughter because she hit ONE wrong button. Now I am either stuck with something or I have to send it back and eat the shipping costs because of a stupid feature that I cannot disable. Wit a joke.
Amazon prime, I trusted my families Christmas gifts to you. Not only did you not deliver, you didn’t even tell me. If my family hadn’t asked,  who would have spent my $200 ?  Not a lot for you maybe. But everything to me.
Amazon has the best team that provides help for any problem, they respond so fast to any issue. They have nice staff, and do any and everything they can to solve any issues. 5 stars!!!
I accidentally ordered two things with really high prices and I need money for something, and it’s not close to shipping but they said they couldn’t cancel the order.
Amazon tech support stated the problem “is Apple’s fault” but regardless of why, we can no longer make purchases via the App. Without that ease of use there is little reason to use Amazon over Walmart etc.
I love Amazon this app will get you any service. I love the products and the service is top rate.
After this experience I won’t do business with Amazon again. The third party seller whom they contracted with told me that I would they  get back the purchase price for the shirt which was $55.99; that they would not refund the shipping fees.  So I expected to receive $55.99. I did not receive what I expected, it was shy $15.00. I have only purchased a few items through this company and I am not impressed. I won’t be back.  I have given them 5 years off and on of opportunities. No more.
App didn’t warn me that you can’t apply a promo and coupon to same order. Gave customer service a chance to rectify situation and they failed. 0 stars
Amazon itself has amazing phone service. They also have amazing policies that take care of the customer. But this app allows you to chat with “customer service” but as cheesy as this sounds, it’s absolutely customer disservice.   The reps take a very long time to help, if they help at all. It literally seems like in everything there always has to be one problem and that problem is absolutely their live “help”. The reps won’t answer questions, they answer very awkwardly on things I had no idea were awkward, it’s like I’m talking to a completely different company when I use the app. I actually uninstalled the app due to the horrible service.   Until they fix the farm they send the app requests to, I suggest calling them or using an email option. Having app reps who are far below a. It also standard of customer service, made me paranoid of having that team of people having access to my personal information inside the app. I do still purchase items and love amazon itself, but their app has actually made me paranoid to use it. 
I want to know when something arrives. Gots lots of stuff arriving from amazon from multiple carriers all times of day. Notifications only allow me to have both shipping and arrival notifies. Don’t care when it ships. With modern day Amazon that almost doesn’t matter anymore. I want to know when it’s on my doorstep and only that.  Also how about a notification complication for the Apple Watch once the first issue is addressed.
I went to buy something on amazon & a pop up appeared from amazon stating download the amazon app & we'll give you $5 off your first $10 purchase. I didn't happen. I contacted Amazon customer service who bounced me around to 4 different people. Not one of them had a clue & I had to repeat my question 4 times.  I just gave up & deleted the app. 
This is a terrible company!!!!!!! I am a PRIME MEMBER and this COMPANY SSSSSUUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKKKKSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was shopping on their account for baby things. I was looking at my checkouts and went back and forth on my cart to check if i have everything i need~ i did not placed any order yet but i received an email saying that i ordered this one thing that is still on my cart! On top of that they processed my account to prime membership which i did not want... 😡😡😡
Amazon is SCAM . I paid for overnight shipping but took 4 days to get my stuff delivered.
Amazon USED to be the best way to online shop! I always added more items to ALL my orders to qualify for free shipping and I loved the recieving my amazon boxes in a timely manner. Now they hold orders for 10-12 days before even “preparing to ship”. I am very disappointed in their negative efforts to force shoppers to pay for subcriptions to Amazon Prime for the fast shipping they once offered all qualified ($35.00 or more) shoppers before Amazon Prime. Everyone needs to unsubscribe from Amazon Prime to force them to return to fast service for all qualifying purchases!! Until then I’m looking elsewhere.
I had to turn them off even though I wanted notifications of orders placed, because my phone won’t stop vibrating to let me know products I never use are on sale. I’m a frequent customer, Amazon, stop p***ing me off.
Just like on the iPhone it needs a customer pic gallery for the app.
Necesito saber si tienen la opción de desconectar todas la conexiones, ya qué hay una persona que está conectada con mi usuario y aún ella ha utilizado mi cuenta y ya no quiero que lo siga haciendo, yo cambie la clave de mi cuenta pero ella aún sigue conectada y lo utiliza
I tried to order somethings for my friend and send the items to her house and I put in the address but I accidentally sent it to my address but the app won't let me edit or cancel my order as of 30 minutes after the purchase as of which I have been trying for the entire time
Downloaded because I saw a promotion where I'd get $10 off a purchase of $20 or more when signing into the app for the first time. Then realize that I wouldn't get the deal for 7 business days in my email. Never got the email, so I called customer service. They never heard about the promotion so wouldn't honor it. Deleting the app now because they don't know what promotions they are running.
I find the Amazon app to be fine but I would definitely enjoy that pay pal feature to be able to pay for things also because I don't really like using cards or my personal bank account for transactions so please integrate Pay Pal!!!!!!
I can’t get rid of the badge notification for this app, so I am temporarily rating the app a 2; I’ll come back and adjust to five whenever this is fixed.
Well first off I’d like to say the app itself as far as purchasing is well’mm good but I’m not exactly at all satisfied at being able to get a hold of customer service. I will probably not be shopping here anymore due to their lack of response to my requests for help
I put in a very specific search term. Yet I get a scattered result. For tires I give a wheel size of 16, and get 15 as well. Look for tires and get canvas spare covers. I don’t need the aggravation.
Amazon is awesome for getting certain items you need however the past two times I have ordered parts for my car the description clearly says this will fit your vehicle, however they don’t fit when they arrive. So I don’t think I’m going to be ordering parts for my car from here anymore.
Get $20 off when you get app and sign in... blah blah blah.. didn’t want the app.. got it because of the promo and never got my coupon .. been almost 2 weeks.. will be deleting now
They canceled my order and investigated my account without my permission. One recent customer service didn’t even read the whole previous chat and left the chat while I was explaining the problem exclaiming restrictions. Super rude! If you are bounded to rules, put rules on customers first, will you? I will never buy from this site anymore! เวรเอ่ย
Jeff Bezos worked hard to become the boot and he has used his wealth with tyrannically. The workers deserve much more than the slave compensation Bezos withers to them. 🙌 to the hard working people of Amazon and the big ol’🐦 to Jeff Bezos and Amazon! Go on strike if you have to!
Order today (Thursday, Dec. 21) with Prime, and receive by next Wednesday (dec 27). Wow. Why am I even paying Prime?   Also have had some pretty rude customer service reps as of late. I know things are crazy during the holidays, but this isn’t ok. 
Amazon is just not trustworthy. They allow sellers who rip people off and take no responsibility for that. With all the power they have, they could at least bet their sellers and protect their customers. Eventually people are just not going to trust them and they will look elsewhere.
Amazon and the company delivery “UPS” Are the worsts 
Ever since they moved their customer relations over seas it’s been going down hill! I call can’t understand the other person who is illiterate to multiple issues  Every time there’s a issue your call service or chat makes it worse!!  Glad this opened my eyes before the renewal date!! I will be canceling!!! 
I added something to a list and several hours later when reviewing a different order, discovered it had been ordered. I a, confident the app was at fault because I had other items in my cart that were still there. No one touch buy screen came up, and for some reason I didn’t notice the email amid others from Amazon. I tried to cancel but they said couldn’t, to which I said not my problem. 8 hours later I get a shipping notification — meaning they had plenty of time to stop it but didn’t, so now I have to deal with all the nonsense.   This was a useful app before, but it appears to have a very inconvenient bug at the moment. 
Gave shipping notifications even though I was not signed into an account. This may have ruined a couple Christmas gifts.
Bought a prime item on Sunday, now it’s saying delivery scheduled for Friday? I did not receive ANY notification of its delay and there is NO WAY to contact anyone for help in the app or on the site. Very frustrating.
I can’t delete the app. Not deleting cus bad, deleting cus need storage. Every time I delete it mysteriously comes back 🤔🤔🤔
This app is so great especially with shipping...I do recommend getting amazon prime but if you don't don't worry shipping is still very fast and very easy to use
Amazon wouldn’t give me the $10 credit they promised for signing in... Going back to eBay.
You need to remove that because if multiple people use the same acct they can see if someone ordered a surprise for that person
Be very careful. I tried to use $170.00ish in reward points and magically it was charged to my Amazon credit card. I noticed it the next day before delivery and they said I would have to return it at a cost of $22+ and reorder it. They could not adjust my Amazon card. Excuse me?  How does the bank know if the package has been returned or not?  Stupid. Then I get an email telling me I did something wrong. However I ordered 2 items and the small item used my points. It was the big ticket item, the one I really wanted, that mysteriously got charged to my card. No wonder Amazon is doing so well.
Trying to update payment info, selection for expiration date greys out the screen with no month / day selection wheel.
Remember when Prime shipping meant you’d have your stuff in two days? After all, that’s what you pay $100 a year for. Now it’s become so convoluted and ridiculous that it simply isn’t worth it anymore. You waste time shopping for items only to find out that “Prime” shipping gets you your stuff in a week or even longer. Uh, what am I paying for then? If it’s not able to be to me in 2 days then why is it allowed to have the Prime icon? Quit trying to backtrack on your promises.
Had a bad day and amazon just made it horrible. The glitches are bad
I have the exact same problem as horselovermom. Please get this fixed- I am just about ready to trash my Amazon account!!!!
I ordered 15 items 9 days before Christmas and all items said will arrive before Christmas. Also ordered 2 items not expected until after Christmas so I paid for expedited shipping to get in 2 days. Not only am I not getting my 15 items until the 29th, but even the items I paid for expedited shipping will be late. When I contacted them they said I can pay an extra $62 to get items before Christmas. Hmmm...
Trying to order a package and send to a different address but every time I put address in-doesn’t save it when go to order.
When I logged on to my account on my browser they had a promo for downloading the app. $20 off next purchase of $40 or more just for logging in to your account through the app. So I did as it instructed and it said congratulation you will get an email with your coupon on 7 days. Ridiculous already, most websites send the coupons right away. Well I of course never got the email and when I called Amazon they said there was nothing they could do without the email confirmation?! the whole reason for the phone call is because I never got it!
This app seems like it was designed in 2012 and hasn't been updated since. Its hard to use and has a few bugs here and there. I tried delivering a package to a certain address and defaulted into a nother address. I didn’t realize this until later so I had to cancel the order.
Not sure where to go, this will be the 4th time in a row that my package will not arrive on the day promised because it’s either shipped to the wrong spot and then it has to backtrack or because it’s just “late” I don’t know what the heck is going on but I’m seriously thinking about taking business else where when it comes to ordering online. First two times I can handle, not four times in a row.
Was given the promotion of a $20 credit for my first app sign in. When I never got it, I went to the promo page and it said I wasn’t eligible. Not worth the memory space
Although items are listed as prime 2-day shipping doesn't mean you will even get the items. Most of the items are listed as available but are truly out of stock in warehouse. I will not be renewing my membership since most items take a week to be delivered.
I have Amazon Prime. I was expecting an item to arrive 2 days later, but instead I get a notification telling me something is wrong with my payment method, but when I go to change it, nothing is wrong with my card information! How are y’all gonna send me an extremely late notification AND be wrong about what you’re trying to tell me? If you noticed something was wrong you should have notified me as soon as the problem arose, not when my items were already scheduled to arrive.
The app used to work great, now it won’t let me see the status of my orders without closing the app and reopening, and then I can only look at one item before the issue resurfaces. Fingerprint recognition has turned into a complete fail as well, after working flawlessly early on.   I’m gonna add an additional gripe, since I’m here. I HATE the fact that it isn’t disclosed when a carrier (looking at you FedEx and UPS) is gonna turn a package over to the USPS for delivery. My expected delivery dates are nothing more than a made up number these days. Right now I have multiple packages in limbo because of this. Amazon is really starting to disappoint with delivery times. I’m a long time and FREQUENT Prime member and user, and am becoming fed up. I pay for Prime to avoid delivery issues, and the quality of service is takings nosedive. Step it up, guys. 
I am very disappointed of Amazon right now!! I have ordered something and all of sudden apparently I still owe money for things I ordered. I understand you only charge the card till the items ship but the thing is then why was my card charged the full amount. But couldn’t give me a reason on what all happened and why they didn’t take the full amount out but when really they did because I was charged for it. I called my bank and they told me I was charged with the full amount I paid for and they told me here is some advice wait 24 hours to see if anything changed when I tried to tell them they already charged me for those items and that I don’t want to be charged again for those items when I already paid for them. When I called customer service and I talked to the 2 ladies they were nice and tried to explain but couldn’t explain where my money disappeared too. And when I called again and talked to this guy and told them I talk to the bank they told me you charged me the full amount that I paid for and then saying that apparently owe you guys still $20 when ik I don’t because I paid the full price for the items I bought the guy I talked to was really rude to me. So I’m sorry amazon but you lost your self a customer. I love shopping on here and I never had problems till all of a sudden. I’m sorry amazon you lost a customer.
I have spent the past hour talking to 5 idiots who could not verify who I was Because I couldn’t remember the exact mailing address where I lived 7 years ago and 5 different states and home ago...I am so mad I cancelled the order and if I could cancel the 12 holiday gifts I just sent I would ... deleting amazon and will scream it to the 400 or so people that I know 
The products I receive from amazon are always in great condition and never have any problems. I am fully comfortable buying something on amazon because I know I will get my money’s worth. The products I purchase are useful and trustworthy. Also, amazon products are great gifts for others and I can always rely on amazon to deliver my packages on the expected due date.
Amazon developers, use the iOS app and try to send a package to a new address.  Copy the address from iMessage and go from there.  Count the number of times you have to re-enter the address, number of times the shipping address switches back to yours and not the new address, and other hurdles along the way.  Please get basics right before venturing in to AR and other crazy stuff.
I'm addicted, everything is right here ✅I shop here almost 5 times a month  You can furnish the entire house 🏡  You find clothes 👚👙👖👔👗👙👘👠👟🎩🎒  for any occasion. The only problem with that is I wish there was single categories, ie: petite, tall, plus size and so on. 🎶 music, 🎥 movies, and reading books📚  Tons of food 🥘 School books 📚🎓 Adult entertainment 💋💦🍆🍑(❌❌❌) And the prime membership is awwwwweeeeessssoooooommmmmmeeeeee, you can't go wrong with free 2 day shipping 🔃 I just wish " Prime Now" & “Amazon Restaurants” delivered in my city ☹️ "Prime pantry" should have its own app🙌🏾so we won't have to go through all the other things  A grid layout would be nice👌🏾 UPDATE: If we have Prime Membership, we should not have to pay $5.99 shipping for the Prime Pantry 
-still doesn’t  properly support the screen resolution of the new 10.5" iPad Pro.  Amazon has gathered up the world’s wealth but too lazy to compile their app properly..  -the related products list used to be sponsored on top, but the bottom list was not sponsored.  now it is all sponsored.  this is a dealbreaker and i will try downgrading to last version i can find without this change.  else will stop using.   the sponsored products are not selected with my best interests in mind.  they are expensive products priced so that the customer pays a premium to pay for the advertising costs the seller pays to amazon.  shameful. 
All of you that rated it a one star are just haters Amazon is the greatest shopping place made so stop hating
Extremely slow, almost unusable when using as a simple grocery list at the store.
Checking out is a nightmare. Like going to the DMV   Requests that I re-enter my credit card every time I want to check out. Defeats the purpose of having the credit card on there. Half the addresses don’t work, and it doesn’t give you a suggested address that they deem is valid that is close to what you entered, like with other websites. On any of these two instances if you hit back... it’ll take you to the checkout page which if you don’t watch carefully, it has your last ship to address selected instead of the new one you’re trying to enter.   Searching for shoes is a nightmare here too. Price advertised is never the true cost, so if you want to pick a range (for obvious budget purposes), you get a shoe that starts at that price, but never is actually that price, and then sizes are rarely available without completely changing the shoe. Doesn’t let you select a size and then a price, which would then narrow your search.   All in all, I might cancel my Prime if I keep having these basic problems when trying to shop here. 
I’ve been a prime member for a very long time. During that time I have used my amazon visa and this app. Now it seems I must re enter my credit card number for everything.  The point of this app is to allow me to shop, which is impossible when I must have my credit card with me 100% of the time. Add that to the fact that amazon does not honor prime shipping anymore and the usps lies about delivery and amazon is fast becoming a joke. Today I was told my package couldn’t be delivered because they couldn’t access my house due to a gate. Bold face lie as the same postal employee delivered my mail along with another amazon package.
My wife and I both have experienced Amazon marketing offers that did not pan out. I was offered a $5 credit for choosing a slower delivery method. My wife was offered $20 for downloading the app and placing her next order. Five plus calls later and an equal amount of guarantees that are credit would show up on our next order, we are still trying to hold Amazon accountable for their marketing promotions. The app is convenient and offers a ton of options, but the principle of being lied to just irritates me to no end!!!
Download this app and did not receive an email as stated with coupon.  Please explain?? 
Will it was my first time shopping on amazon I was trying to buy markers and I did skin tone markers when the package got to my home I was so excited, I open the package and I got a rainbow set of markers??.. Not what I ordered. I thought maybe they ran out? So I decided to buy these crown pencils. I checked it said it was delivered yesterday to my house; by the way I was at my grandpas house spending the night. I come home and the pencils are not at my house?? What’s going on amazon get your stuff together.
Charged me for amazon prime after my one month free trial, after I canceled it and called to ensure it was canceled. Terrible app and terrible customer service.
Very buggy app. I realized I ordered two of the same shirts immediately, and tried to cancel one of the shirts days before it even shipped. And the order still wasn’t cancelled. Now it’s shipping and I don’t even have the option to cancel it. I tried going to customer service to cancel it through there and it lets me click on the product but doesn’t show the option to cancel. Just another way Amazon is crooning me out of my hard earned money! I will not continue to be a customer if this isn’t resolved!!

Amazon is the worst company I’ve ever dealt with for anything in my life. At this point I’m pursuing litigation instead of a BBB complaint. Considering it’s such a massive company, their sheer lack of customer service and the way they deal with orders, customer accounts, and customers themselves is outright shocking. I’m over it, I’m going a step further beyond a better business bureau complaint after this week.
I buy A LOT thru Amazon but hesitant to at Christma. If it's not Prime, it's difficult to see where an item is actually coming from prior to ordering it. I have yet to find a place where it notes if it's coming from across seas or not. VERY unhappy as two things I ordered told me After I ordered them that they won't be here for 6 weeks. I tried cancelling one for 2 days and the site kept freezing. I contacted the seller (Amazon still showed item as processing and NOT shipped) and was told it had already shipped and they couldn't cancel it. It didn't show shipped for another day. I messaged them back to ask what the return address will be so I can refuse the package and they didn't even understand what I was asking and responded with instructions just to refuse the package. ANNOYED😠😠😒😒😒
It said order Saturday but then it said arriving Sunday!
I LOVE Amazon & always shop online with them. I’ve had great customer service & found great products & deals. I’m an Amazon Prime member.  BUT, the app is basically useless right now. It used to be very convenient, but I’m getting the same prompt to re-enter my password followed by the “something went wrong” message. As soon as that is fixed, I will gladly change my rating to a 5 star to reflect the improvements.  Amazon, please help get this fixed! We need it for the holidays! 
About 3-4 weeks ago, Amazon decided to start using the app’s push notifications to try to sell you more stuff. Once per day you’ll get some stupid notification that has nothing to do with your order(s), account, etc. You can turn it off in your phone’s settings, but that means all notifications are turned off for the app so you won’t get any push notifications about your orders... the info you actually you want! They’re basically forcing you to read their sales notification nonsense if you want useful order update notifications. AMAZON - This completely betrays your consumers’ trust and you might want to question the short term gains compared to the long term UX/brand degradation.
Charged for my “free trial” of Prime moments after I selected free trial. Another reason I can’t stand this company.
Ok I’ve used amazon for years and I like it I really do but now we have to HAVE A SUBSCRIPTION in order to post reviews on products now? I’m only 17 and working a minimum paying job. I can’t afford amazon prime and the one time I want to write a review on something, I can’t because apparently that’s just a luxury only certain people can have???!?!? What the actual heck
There is a number 1 showing up like I have a notification and for three hours I’ve been trying to get this 1 to go away.  It won’t no matter what I do.  Very annoying
Love this app/store tons of gifts and love the prime feature..... sometimes u just need ur stuff soon!
Great customer service and great help
Helpful for price checking on the go
Have ordered several things over the years from them, and have had orders cancelled from time to time with no email or notification. Still got billed for said product and had to dispute. Last purchase was supposed to be post Black Friday sale products from a company on amazon. Purchased, paid and order has been cancelled, spoke with customer service and said there is nothing they can do. And product is not available when they look it up, well maybe not now. I ordered it 16 hrs ago. I will be going sticking with eBay and Jet. They honor there little messups, or at least try to fix it
This app can’t get any better! I absolutely love everything you can but on here and I mean anything. It’s such a simple app to use and it can save you more money than actually going to the store.
Somehow, someway, you guys charged me for prime. I have bills to pay and I can barely make those payments without you people taking money from my account without my consent. Now I am overdrawn and charged $25 for being overdrawn. I am deleting the app and NEVER will I ever shop from you guys again. So thanks for completely screwing me over.
Amazon stuffs packages into mailboxes damaging them instead of delivering to the door and fails delivery on every other order I place. If you can’t deliver on-time, don’t promise it. Simply refunding the amount paid does not solve the problem. Disappointed.
Amazon is an amazing app for shopping. I get things from Christmas gifts to everyday items. Everything is cheap, but still good quality. If you really want a good experience, get Amazon Prime. You get free shipping (wonderful right?), music, tv, books, and more. Sometimes I will shop on other sites and forget about shipping because I’m used to Amazon 😂. Thank you so much Amazon you do a great job with everything, best shopping app ever! I totally recommend to anyone.
Amazon is great, the app is really useful too, but you get a one star until you make sure no advertisements take over REAL media playback via airplay. There’s not a single person in the world that wants to have their big screen spammed with ads while doing shopping on their phone as they watch or listen to other media. Fix it.

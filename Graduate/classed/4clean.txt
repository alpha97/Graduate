I'm disappointed that they don't let us see customer pictures. I'll stick with the website version.
Love the app overall, however, I just recently tried to used iOS split view on iPad Pro with no luck. Would be nice to research a product online while simultaneously viewing availability from Amazon.
Welp, I love Amazon. But I can’t order anything until they stop giving the NRAtv a platform for promotion. Will update once they cut ties.
Yesterday I changed my password from my computer. Since then I have not been able to sign back in on the iPhone app. I signed out and tried multiple times to log in and couldn’t even get to a screen where I was asked to enter my username/password. I went as far as to delete and reinstall the app, but still no luck. Tested on multiple working WiFi networks and on cellular network, makes no difference. No other apps have issues, but every time I attempt to sign in, I’m greeted with a “Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again” message. Stick to using the mobile version of the site or a full browser version.
Keep getting error message when I check on the order
I spend a lot of money on Amazon  But PLEASE!! Get rid of the buy with one click option. Because it's making you buy everything in your cart even though you don't wanna purchase all that just yet. I literally had to hurry and cancelled the order bc it said my total was $726 and I'm like wooahhhh!!!  So I had to delete EVERYTHING out my cart just to get one item. Super annoying. 
Since the latest update the app won't let you proceed to checkout!  How can we make a purchase if the app won't let us?  This is extremely frustrating because now I have to use a PC to purchase items and not my iPhone!
Anyone with access to an unlocked iPad can make a purchase. On the iPhone, when “biometric authorization” is turned on, touch ID is required for purchase.   Also on the iPad, the the ability to email support is broken, except about the predefined topics. On the iPhone, tapping “other” a few times let you write a free-form email. 
Everything I add something to cart, I get error message saying to try again later. This just started after the update today. I have rebooted app and phone, still same problem
I’ll order one thing and the thing underneath that gets order as well I wouldn’t use this app ever agian
There is an error when trying to view Orders. Please fix this bug!
I can check review photos on the iPhone app but not the iPad app? That’s so annoying. I have to switch to safari or I just end up picking up my phone.
After the update, it consistently says that something went wrong, and I can no longer purchase anything .
Will not accept any passwords or load any data. Always asks for a touchscreen fingerprint and never works. I know for a fact it does when I unlock my IPhone 6s with the same method moments before trying this worthless amazon app. No customer support, do not recommend at all! EBAY is the way to go!!
I used to love this app! I used it daily and it was wonderful for purchasing things on the go – I didn’t have to remember to buy things when I got home because I could simply purchase them via the app with one click while out and about.   In the last several months, however, I have had significant problems functionally using this app. I can still use this app to browse products, add things to my cart, check out reviews, etc. However, when I go to check out or look at my order history, the app gets stuck on the login process – after I put in my password, I get an error message: “sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.“  This is so odd because I can successfully add things to my cart - which must be linked to my account, because when I get home and check out on my computer, the items that I added via the app are there. I just can’t check out via the app and this has been going on for months. It is endlessly frustrating. I have all of the latest updates on my phone. My husband has the same problem and he has an older Version of iOS.  Amazon, please fix! 
Mine won’t even work with the latest update. Just keeps saying try again. I can log in fine on the same device, on safari. Please fix!!
As off right now I’m on WiFi at home. Tried to go on lightning deals half of the page the items of pictures loaded, but as you scroll further, just blank thumbnails. Clicked on the item and it says still loading... all this happened after I updated the app.
Please update for iPhoneX - Face ID does not work and no longer allows the app to sync with your account.
Well the app hasn’t worked right on my iPhone 7plus in months. Always has an error, something went wrong or still loading. Great when it worked. Please fix!!
The registry process needs completely revamped. I cannot even select items on my registry to edit/replace. This is specific to the iPad however I also experience lots of issues on both my iPad and tablet. Please fix.
Some could argue my review denies all the other wonderful aspects of Amazon, but the problem I’ve come across really ruins the entire shopping process for me.   Teen Prime. What a great deal, I get my own account with prime just because my parents own one. But I can’t shop on anything but the Amazon App. You’d think the solution would be share an account or make your own.   If I share an account I don’t get my own recommendations (which is an awesome feature). If I make my own account I don’t get the convient deals of Prime or have to buy an entirely new account with Prime.   If you’re going to offer this deal, why restrict it to just an app? Why would you limit it just the app? It’s disappointing that I cannot shop on the computer because I am on my computer more often than the phone and it is more convient to use. Additionally, there’s all sorts of plug-ins available on the PC to allow you find the best deals. I cannot use these tools on my phone.   I recommend Amazon and the Amazon app, but not the feature Teen Prime. It’s not worth it. Thank you for the amazing company Amazon but if possible, please fix this issue. 
Amazing the almighty Amazon has an app that blows chunks. And no Chunks is not my dog.
Every time I try log in, I get an error saying “Something went wrong.” I emailed Amazon support and never received a reply.
If you have an iPhoneX, don’t get this: It launches and immediately displays a message “Please check your internet connection and try again” Amazing that one of the largest tech giants can’t make a functioning app with one of the most popular current phones 
Used this app for years till the past year. Won’t connect to the internet and say try again. Nothing wrong with my internet cause everything else works like usual. I’ve deleted and reinstalled countless times but still can’t use it.
Amazon, you rock. Amazon Prime rocks. It all rocks. Even the app. But ever since the update a few days ago I’ve been having issues. I can’t apply for the Amazon Visa card, I can’t see my order history, the update has made the app basically useless for me. And since I do most of my Amazon shopping via my phone, this is a big problem for me. Please fix this, Amazon!
Can no longer check order status or place an order in app. I have to login through an browser to do either of these things. I have tried on different devices with Touch ID and with Face ID neither works. This is a basic important function that needs to be corrected.
Until the most recent update I never had an issue on my iPad. I updated and now, even though I. Logged in, when I try to view my wishlist, it asks me to log in, with my fingerprint and 10 tries later I’m still getting the same error “something is wrong. Please try later”.  I can’t even type my password in
every time i try to order something from my amazon app, i hit the “proceed to checkout” button and it says “oops something went wrong, try again later”. well i haven’t been able to order anything on my amazon app now for awhile and i’m ready for y’all to fix the problem!!!!
Every time I sign in, the app says “something went wrong” and then freezes. I close the app, open it back up and the same thing happens. The app is very slow in addition to not properly logging me in. Love amazon, hate amazon app. Fix these issues.
They added Face ID and now I can't log into my account.
On this app I ordered toe cream and it accidentally got it on my pillow. After I  got back from paying taxes my cat lost all of its hair from sleeping on the pillow, but I did not know that. So I went to sleep and everything was fine until I took a shower and my hair fell out.
Your tag line for the app reads, shopping made easy. LIE. If it were easy, I would be able to make purchases from the app, I can’t. Especially in particular, things from my wish lists.
With the new update, the app now refuses to even open. I click on the icon, and nothing happens. I have tried to delete, and then reinstall, but no luck. Same problem persists. I have IOS 10.3.3 so I see no reason why it is now behaving this way. Likely one of the new updates. Previously, the app worked great, like it was supposed to. Please fix!
Different screens will not load. I have reinstalled the app a few times and it still doesn’t work right. Especially when I try to view orders. This is only a problem on my IPhone the app works fine on my Android phone.
The best thing put the dash button in the home page. The only thing that they need to improve it when i do and order to asked for my fingerprints to complete the purchase thanks
This isn’t the 1st time I’ve had an issue with Amazon & not getting my products. They have changed to protecting their sellers more than their customers! Think before you buy anymore.
11.3.0 crashes when opened. Remove & uninstall fails by crashing when try to log in. Unusable
Everything was fine until the Feb 8, 2018 update.  Now the app closes a second after it opens on my iPhone 8.  Please fix this ASAP.
Hey Devs...latest update crashes the app. IPhone 6 64GB latest version of iOS 11.2.5. Can’t use app any longer. Prime member as well.
Downloaded the latest update.  When I open the app and try to get to lists (on iPhone), the app crashes.  Sometimes it just crashes after a few seconds of just being open.
App is crashing immediately after startup. Just started. Love Amazon!  Need to fix this!!!
Whenever I find a good deal and try to buy it the app always crashes
Please make a added feature to unlock the app with our finger thank you
Like the title says, it never works over cellular network. Before I had tmobile and now with att still the same
I haven’t been able to login from the app for about 2 month every time I attempt to login I receive a message that says “sorry something went wrong, try again” with both username and password as well as Touch ID, I can’t make a purchase from the app anymore please address
I’ve been using the app for ages seamlessly. But now when I try to check on my orders it says “Oops. Something has gone wrong.” Every time. I came here to contact them and the button just ok me to information about the app on Amazon’s website. That’s not super helpful either.
With the new app update I am unable to purchase through the app I have to log into a browser. It keeps telling me something unexpected happened. If I have to keep logging in through a browser there is no point in having the app.
I find most anything I look for at Amazon and exclusively use this app with no problems. Making, changing and even cancelling orders is a snap—as well as returning items bought. No complaints whatsoever. 👍
Amazon is horrible to not let me and others cancel their orders before it even ship shame on you amazon shame on you!
For the past week I’ve been very frustrated with the app. Whenever I try to view my orders or make a purchase and I have to put my password in, a little box pops up that says it encountered a problem. I use amazon on my laptop and my desktop with no problems and I know I’m using the correct password. I want to be able to view my orders and make purchases on my phone because it’s the most convenient. Can you fix this please?? It’s SO annoying!!
Consistently just get a white screen when trying to use the app. You are better off just using their mobile site. Worst app on my phone.
It has been ages since the update that prevents you from actually ordering anything or checking on your orders. It just puts you in an endless loop of trying to sign in and being told something is wrong. And more bad news if you use Amazon to sign into your good reads account well that's broken too.
The app works fine. Not great. It’s still easier to go to the mobile site than trying to do anything with my account in the app. Entering my password never works the first time, and I usually have to refresh to get to my orders. It has some wrinkles that need to be smoothed, and until then, I’ll just go to the mobile site for anything account-sensitive.
Since the new update, I am asked to login anytime I want to do anything within my account other than browsing. Great. No problem. I’m glad my information is secure... but then I get a notice saying, “Sorry. Something went wrong. Try back later.” I can only purchase items from my desktop which makes having the app on my phone worthless.
Login causes some error and not able to make a purchase.
App is fine for browsing & adding things to your cart, but if I ever try to check out, I get asked to log in followed by an error message “Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.” I don’t think I’ve ever successfully checked out through the app.
This app used to be really good, but lately it is horrible. I can’t actually buy anything from the app. It just doesn’t respond when I click the order button. I have to use my desktop computer to complete.  And now, whenever I try to add something to the cart, I keep getting pop ups saying that something went wrong and it cannot complete the request. Also, sometimes it will not allow me to select other options for a particular product. I’ve tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling, but still have the same problems. You’d think as big as Amazon is, they’d have someone capable of developing a workable app.
Sorry something went wrong. Please try again. Sorry something went wrong. Please try again. Sorry something went wrong. Please try again. Sorry something went wrong. Please try again. Sorry something went wrong. Please try again. Sorry something went wrong. Please try again. Sorry something went wrong. Please try again. Sorry something went wrong. Please try again. Sorry something went wrong. Please try again. Sorry something went wrong. Please try again. Sorry something went wrong. Please try again.
I continuously get “sorry, something went wrong”. Can’t order, have to use the mobile site. The app doesn’t load most of the time, and always asks for my password over and over. Frustrating, haven’t used it to order in quite some time. When I do the update and go into it, nothing has been fixed.
Let me start by saying I used to absolutely ADORE this app. However, in the last few updates everything has gone to hell in a hand basket. Adding items to the cart? Works just fine. Purchasing said items in cart? Nope. No can do. Every time I click on the place order button, it acts like it’s processing the order then just reverts back to my cart with the items still in it. The only way I can purchase anything is if I use the one click option. Also, the app will randomly ask me for my password when I have been logged in and using the app for some time and then tell me its wrong. Yet nothing changes except I have to force close the app and start all over because it\'s stuck in this stupid password glitch. Same thing happens whenever I try to look at anything with my account. It will ask for a password and tell me it’s wrong or that an error occurred and make me force close.
Please calibrate customer service chat for iPhone X. It was very frustrating trying to send a message, but needing to click above the box for it to actually work. Other than that, the app is great!
My parents and I each have separate amazon accounts and I frequently need to sign them in to theirs to help use gift cards or order household items. The process of signing in and out is a bit tedious. I don’t think the sign out button should be hidden under a second, separate settings menu. It should be the first option in the menu. It would also help me to avoid buying something with the wrong account.
Current app doesn’t support fingerprint access on iPhone 8plus. Every time I try to sign in or check out, and I’m prompted to submit my fingerprint, I receive and error code that something went wrong. I’ve uninstalled this app 3 times. It’s terrible. I fix needs to come soon. I’m an avid amazon shopper. The ease of this app is necessary.
Works like the Amazon website except for problems with notifications.   I keep getting messages that my parcel will delivered after it was delivered.   In addition on both my iPhone and my iPad touch ID simply does not work therefore I can only add items to my shopping cart and then I have to log into my PC to actually complete the order. 
Since the last update my ability to log on with the fingerprint reader has stopped working. I cannot get it to work anymore. I am deleting the app and just using the website to access Amazon. Worthless.
If you are traveling and your account is only with phone and you forgot your password you can’t use nothing and you cant notify any of your orders
Very difficult to follow what you have ordered in this latest version. I doubled ordered, because it wasn’t clear that the order had been placed. A orders pending on the app would be helpful.
The app is great except for the fact I can’t order Kindle books which I do a lot. What’s up with that Amazon?
The last update was a nightmare, can’t sign in. Always getting an error that reads something went wrong. Stop trying to fix what was never broken!
So as you are reading this review keep in mind that I love Amazon. I have prime and I use it regularly. I love the app for my iPhone. However The app for iPad ...... needs some serious help. You cant add items to registries easily. When I opened it I felt like I had my old bar phone trying to look at a website 7 years ago. I’m going to be deleting it and just using the browser from here on out. Please Please PLEASE work on it. Thanks.
Everyone needs to see their order status in two places.....right?
I used this app for a couple of years and had no problems until I’ve recently made purchases and my account gets locked. I thought I forgot the password and went through the reset process, but I can’t access my account because of security reasons, very confused on how and why my account is locked. I put in my billing and address in, I’ve confirmed that everything is mine months ago. Once I get my account locked I have to do everything again, and wait additional days to confirm its mine again. I’ve made purchases that was as cheap as $25, but when I try to buy my college textbooks which is about $100 or more, this is when the problems occur. This app is frustrating and problematic.
Can’t check on my order status. Whenever I click to go to my orders I get an unknown error.
Window shopping!!!! Didn’t have a chance to purchase them!!! And I got destroyed by your... messing my phone device.... cost me  my phone!!!   Thanks
Haven’t been able to order products inside this app this month. Not sure if they are gonna fix it or not. Called and complained already.
App is great except for I have to have WiFi for it to work. Just wish it would work off of my phone service.
After the last update I can no longer sign in to my account using the app. I can sign in using a browser just fine, but not the app.
I have installed and uninstalled this app multiple times and it will not load. Says to check internet connection
Every time I use the app to check my orders it tells me something went wrong and then says still loading. Please fix this.
Please fix this mess!!!!! Some new updates was done to iOS and it’s causing issues with the app, I can’t no longer look at old purchases nor buy anything from the app , I have to go to the website. Amazon please fix this! I buy from amazon VERY frequently and this is very inconvenient
Every time I want to do anything it asks for my password, then it says “something went wrong” I’m sick of it. Having to go to a browser to place orders now because they doesn’t want to work. I haven’t been able to complete an order on this app for so many months I don’t remember. I’ll just order less or not at all.
Might be the new IOS update but the app for my iPhone 7+ just shows a flashing blank screen. Let’s get an update Amazon and quick.
This has been a garbage and completely useless app on iPhone for over 6 months. Impossibly to check out of cart, it just keeps kicking back to “proceed to checkout” after selecting where I want my items shipping. So inconvenient to have to open safari, log in to amazon again, then checkout, and then inevitably have to type some info in that should have been saved.
I used to be able to print from my phone when I had a return now I can’t even do that. This app is slowly turning into garbage. Every update removes good features.
Used to use it all the time, but in recent weeks it keeps bouncing back to the cart when Im trying to check out. After years of using Amazon, it’s time to find another source! Disappointed!
iPhone app not working. After update the app will not successfully complete an order.
This app constantly makes me sign in. Then I'm in and then I start to scroll and I have to sign in again. I've rebooted and I've download a newer version and still the same. I constantly get a "something went wrong" error message.
Every time I open the app it tells me my internet connection is poor. But people will open the app right next to me on their phones and it’s fine. WiFi, data, nothing works. I want to be able to use the app, but no update fixes it. Not sure what’s up but please fix it
This app works fine when searching at home, but it will not work inside the Lowes store. App returns "internal error".  My iPhone is set to allow this app to use cellular data.  Otherwise the app works well. 
I’m a big Amazon user, but the app is horrible. It never works for me. It ALWAYS says “check your internet connection and try again” and never lets me get beyond that. This has gone on for months and months since first downloading it — and i keep returning thinking it might have been updated or improved, but no.  I’ve restarted my phone a hundred times, x-ed our the app and re-downloaded it, and obviously checked my internet connection... never works.   And while there’s some record of others having this issue, there’s no solution I can find.   Oh well, lost business for Amazon. 
There are many issues with the app not loading correctly or buttons not responding to touch. Especially in the top area where the time is.   The most annoying issue is, if you make a purchase and then try to make another purchase minutes after, the app just will crash after you click on “checkout”.  You have to go to the website to actually go through checkout. 
This app worked fine until about a month ago. Now, when I go to check out, it keeps bumping back to my cart. I end up having to go to the regular website on my phone and complete check out there. So annoying.
My app isn’t working, it doesn’t want to connect to the internet
It has been telling me for over a week now to check my internet connection and try again. I have checked and been on WiFi, everything on my phone works but this app. 😡
I don’t know what the deal is but any time I try and view my order history, account or even try and sign out I just get a pop up saying that sorry something has gone wrong please try again. Been doing this for at least a week now. Not sure if it’s related to Touch ID but every time I go to a screen that wants my fingerprint, after doing so I get the error.
Why can I not disable the app from creating dash buttons?  Amazon said it’s a benefit for Prime members. BS it is freaking punishment. I don’t need a dumb button taking up screen UI to help me remember anything. Idiots.
Update:  still broken. "Still loading" and "something went wrong", the two most common phrases you'll see when trying futilely to use this app.  I just make purchases elsewhere when using my iPad because amazon has the most resource intensive website that is almost unusable on mobile devices.  ------- The widget stopped working and the app freezes when you do things like try to check S&S or just browse. 
I constantly get a message that the app can’t connect to the internet and to try again later. I usually end up deleting the app and re-downloading it. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn’t. It’s annoying.
App works for browsing. Saving to lists. Adding to cart.  Will Not Work For Final Checkout.  Weird that Amazon would not like to complete purchase from app.   What’s up with fingerprint login??  Ever going to show up? 
Tried several times no response from app.  Tried several days later same thing happened.  Had to go to desktop to order
Why is the phone app so much better? I can’t see registries or add anything from this app. Please improve.
Amazon is my favorite place to shop. I often browse for deals and gift ideas when I have nothing better to do. However since this new update, it’s IMPOSSIBLE for me to check out. I get the error “Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.” Repeatedly. First it was just signing in. Which I already was because my wish list was loading and I was able to add something to my Kindle via Kindle Unlimited yesterday. After about 3 tries, I finally was able to log in. Thought it was a fluke. Then it took another 5 tried to verify shipping address because when I clicked to choose the address, it would crash the pop up and go back to my cart. When it came time to choose shipping method since my order qualifies for free shipping.... let’s just say I gave up after 5 tries.
Ever since I got my iPhone X ap stopped working. It scans my face then say something went wrong please try again later been doing that for the last 3 days straight
This last update killed my Amazon iPad app. It does not work now. I only get an error message. It works fine on my iPhone, but app no longer works on my iPad. Please fix ASAP!!  UPDATE: Two days after latest update and still can’t use my iPad app. FIX THIS...PATCH REQUIRED‼️ 
As an enduser who without amazon would own nothing in their home, I must say why can’t I toggle between my personal and my business account with in the app? The web site should as well but really not the app? This is not a good CX. Also, this promotes low quality passwords being used for ease of toggling. Please consider this update. Thanks.
I get an error that says something went wrong. Please try again.
Always messing up now. Will delete and reinstall. Can’t chat with customer service it will freeze and it is always asking for password and then error will pop up.
Right now I’m pretty disappointed I can’t access anything on my account through the app but as soon as I go through the safari it works. Please fix it or I’m going to delete it. It shows up an error any time I try to order anything or go into see my previous orders.
I’ve been using this app for a long time now I cannot load the app to place an order and it asks for my password every two seconds and then says there’s way an error and when I use it I’ve been hacked I was not sure if it was my phone so I rebooted it call customer service they cannot figure it out after I rebooted my phone I had no problem and then the app started glitching and waiting my password over and over again and now I’m hacked again ugh very frustrating
I legit can not open my Amazon app. I have deleted it and re-downloaded it. I keep getting this “please check your internet connection and try again” (CS1) on the screen and no matter what I do I am unable to use on my phone. If there is anyone else going thru this what can I do to fix this issue.
Getting a CS1 “no internet”. Been getting it for 2 weeks. Have uninstalled and reinstalled and nothing works. Writing review on the same phone where it says I have no internet.
Can’t believe it’s been down for this long... can’t really even remember the last time it worked. Keeps you from having easy access to shipment info as well.
Suddenly this is terrible - error logging in. Buttons not working in app. Fix did not fix anything......
Keep getting an error every time I try to log in. Never had this before but a quick update or fix would be nice
Kudos to the Amazon app folks. They did an update and immediately there was a problem with the toolbar. But within a couple of days they had it fixed and the app is working great. It’s really a great app (again)
The app is great on iPad, with the exception of not being able to access your account information and gift card balances. This can be done on my phone app, but why it isn’t available on the iPad version just baffles me.
Suddenly, my login works erratically. Sometimes I can login to place orders. Sometimes I can’t. Somehow there’s accidentally a double order but I never got far along enough for confirmation and now I can’t get it to let me login to cancel them.
Months after the iPhone X is released Amazon cannot get its act together to fix the Face ID problem their app has. Train wreck! Failure! Cannot view orders, place them, etc.
I used to have no problem with this app. Now, recently, I have tried to make several orders and when I press “place order” it brings me back to lproceed to checkout” very frustrating and renders the app completely useless. Please fix this issue.
Haven’t been able to complete a purchase in the app for weeks. Super buggy checkout funnel.
App freezes and some buttons no longer work with the new update.
I have a new iPhone X so it’s not my software, the new amazon app does not let me tap anything on the top 1/4 of the screen (wishlist, cart, orders button, nothing). Fix this!!!!
I lost 30$ cause I wasn’t using a real gmail and I had the 30$ in my account but I couldn’t by nothing  and I redeemed it on the same phone and know that I have a gmail it’s says it’s already need redeem I wasted 30$
I’ve been using this app to purchase items from amazon for years with no problem.  But as of recently I can’t view orders, purchase orders as I get the “something went wrong” error.  Used to love this app as it worked flawlessly but it’s a shame it’s not working anymore.
Can't cancel order through app. I have to log online through my computer to cancel an order. Please fix this. It's been three updates and this still hasn't been fixed.
I used to love this app, but now it’s really hard to navigate thru. Things I do like using the back button, or clicking on basket just doesn’t doe anything. Thought it was my phone touch screen was being unresponsive, but I’m only having issues on Amazon.
I love Amazon, but I can't use it now with the update!! Please fix! The buttons at the top don't work.
Need to fix the problem for the iPhone X where the top menu buttons don’t work. I can’t click on my cart, or go back or anything.
Every time I open the app I see my profile pic, so I know I’m signed in. I go to ‘my orders’ and it has me sign in every time and every time it displays an error msg saying something went wrong...should I reinstall he app?
With the latest update it freezes and can’t search and order items effectively, needs a fix asap
Update made app unusable. Freezes all the time in different screens.  Update: bugs are only when tray is open. Hiding it made all normal. 
Amazon buttons are not working. I try to click on the top buttons, such as go back (arrow) and the three lines and to go to my registry and they aren’t working!! App needs and update or an update fix!!
After the latest update it’s not working correctly you can I go back it get stuck trying to order need fixing 👎🏿
Checking out and actually buying things is impossible in this version. It continuously asks for your password, and every time says that something went wrong.  Please fix.
Version that updated a few days ago causes major issues when searching. Primarily trying to use the back button on my IPhone X. Otherwise would get four stars.
Since the update yesterday the app constantly freezes up.
This app makes it way too easy for me to order just about anything I can think up.... love...   The new update... the top of the app is unresponsive- ... that’s where the search bar is!! Now I can’t order anything I can dream up... hate...   This is the only app that does it- so I know it’s not the phone...   help? 
App just updated & now I can’t use the back arrow up top. I have to force close & try again. It still doesn’t work....
When I go to wish lists, the “See all wishlists” button doesn’t work.  I can’t get to my other lists.  I’m on an iPhone 6s.  Please fix.
Hell there is some weird issue with amazon on the iPhone X. I am in able to use the top button (back, cart) I usually have close out the app then re open it but that’s kinda unfortunate. Please fix thank you
The Amazon app continuously freezes on me after the latest update.  Please fix ASAP!
Every time I want to access orders it wants my Touch ID and when I put my fingerprint on it says that something went wrong...
Will update review once it's working again after another update  UPDATE 1/12: recent update still made this app unusable. Not you’re making my phone look like it has touch disease or something. Please fix ASAP 
What the hell is going on with your app today.  Keeps freezing.
I can’t choose to check my cart or search or even my account tab
I love amazon and I love being a prime member. But the app gets worse and worse every time I update it. Wish list bar, ten different steps just to purchase something. And now that I updated it today, I can’t click on anything. I click on a product, I can no longer hit back, buy, click on my cart. Nothing. I have to force close my app and then I get the same problem two seconds later. Please fix before I delete the app and discontinue use.
It only lets me tap on things for so long until it just completely stops working and I cannot backspace, browse or anything. Pretty much anything I click on won’t work and I have to completely get out of the app! This hasn’t ever happened until the most recent update. Please fix!!!!!
The app was working just fine until the last couple updates came along!! Now I can’t use the app to purchase anything. I can add to my cart but can’t check out. Fix please!
This latest version of the app freezes constantly on my iPhone 8 plus.
I love this app it is great for what it has been made for. But  I always get please check your network connection. I get that quite often. (CS1). Can you please get this problem fix. Or  tell me what causes this problem. I have full service on my cell phone when I am getting this problem.  Thanks.
Last update freezes the app within a couple seconds of use. Please fix!
Just uploaded the latest update and now the “<“ doesn’t work.  Have to keep closing the app and reopening it.   I’m sure they will fix soon
I have a couple of complaints.  First a month and a half ago I purchased something for my husband’s company through Amazon using his company card.  All of a sudden it changed that card to my primary card even though I did not do that and I had a bunch on charges on that card.  I had to delete that card off of my account of which I shouldn’t have had to do. Also all of a sudden the buttons at the top of the app are not working.  I press the arrow at the top and nothing happens.  Please fix. 
Unfortunately, the app now locks up. I am able to search and add an item but after that there is some serious hang time before anything works. I have rebooted my iPhone multiple times which seems to help a little but has been quite frustrating when searching and adding previous orders. I am not sure if this has to do with the latest 11.2.2 iOS update or not but I now have to use my  computer to order anything on Amazon.
I love Amazon in the app works generally quite well, however there are some formatting problems at the top of the screen when running on an iPhone X. Some of the elements at the top of the screen are too close to the status bar and the notch. There is even some overlap at times so controls become inactive.
Trying to use this app now, who doesn’t love Amazon? lol but it’s very frustrating to use at the moment... please update ASAP!
This app was working fine until the latest update. Now the back button doesn’t work at all when you’re interviewing a product after getting to it via your order history.
App opens but won’t load anything - keeps giving me an error message. I’ve restarted my phone, deleted and re-downloaded the app... nothing works. Such a shame.
Every time I try to go to my orders I have to enter my password and I get the error “something went wrong try again” but it never works! Both on my iPhone and iPad.
Great app, but I get the something went wrong when trying to login message so I have to make purchases through a browser interface. Tried deleting and reinstalling but still didn’t fix the issue. Help!
Every time I try to open the app to check my orders or look at my lists, it prompts me to login. When I put in the correct info it then says that a problem has occurred. It usually allows me to go on to the page I want anyway, but it continually asks me to sign in as I browse around. Yesterday I couldn’t complete my order online because it wouldn’t let me log in and I had to use a desktop to complete the order.
The app is becoming ever more cluttered with useless information and recommendations. Between these and the obtrusive Dash buttons, it is cumbersome to work through the app and difficult to do so without inadvertently touching unnecessary links.  Please clean this up. Your customers are loyal enough that there is not a need to force feed them with unwanted information and images. 
The app stopped accepting my password. I keep getting some kind of error notice
Won’t let me see orders or anything on my account on my iPad. Just says “sorry something went wrong, try again” Nothing helpful at all. Fix please
The iPhone app is severely limited. Common things, like editing a wishlist, are not possible to do in the app.
I’ve never had a problem with this app up until now. I’ve had to do my last three purchases via safari because it won’t let me go past the cart. When I add the items and try to edit my shipping information it keeps kicking me back out. I’ve tried updating the app and even deleting and re-downloading, very inconvenient.
App has been having issues lately with notifications. For some time, I wouldn’t get any now it constantly tells me there’s new spark announcements even though I have those notifications turned off.
I can almost never access My Orders or My Account from the app. It gives me an error message and says to try later. This also happens frequently when trying to purchase items. If I can buy items or see my orders from the app, there’s really no use in using it at all...
I have LOVED the Amazon app until recently. For about the past month, any time I try to log in, it wants my password. I put the password it and it flashes up a little box that says ‘sorry something went wrong. Try again.’ EVERY single time.  I have resorted to using my Safari browser to log into Amazon, but it’s kind of a pain when I have an app to do it. 
cant do anything with this update.  Its not loading. cant pull up my orders, pop up  says sorry something went wrong  try again later and it just keeps loading forever!!!!😠😖
Login error, empty shopping carts and unsuccessfully kindle downloads. That’s I all been there for the past few years of Kindle iOS. What’s more surprising is that this is a continuing trend that things does not work... hope for better
Keeps erroring out. I used to be able to put items in my cart then the next time on on my Mac I could process the order. Can't even do that now. 🙁
Always gives me an error when I sign in and now it won’t let me complete my order. Totally worthless! This has been a problem for months.
Love Amazon, but the app is the worst. Crashes constantly, makes me think Bree my password multiple times, and then always gives me the “something went wrong” screen. Always! Super buggy:
Amazon really needs to fix this issue now! I shouldn't have to double check every single order to make sure Amazon hasn't hasn't added extras of most of the products I am ordering!! It's a good way for Amazon to slip extra costs on the customers end though 😡
I love this app. I use it all the time. But the last couple of weeks I have had log in issues and trouble placing orders. I use an iPhone 7plus and have the same issues on my iPad. When it asks for my password I get a “sorry something went wrong” message and it won’t let me complete my order. The same thing happens when I check my past orders. I have to go to my computer to place an order.
I give this an overall score of 5 stars, this app is even better than the website because it easier to use without any interruptions!😍😻😻😻LOVE, LOVE,LOVE
I love amazon, and I’m a frequent buyer, but it’s so frustrating to me that when I want to look at the details of my order and I’m asked to put in my password, I get a message stating “something went wrong please try again” when I know I’ve entered it right. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!
I don’t know why, but for the past few months or so (I didn’t use the app as much before) I experience an issue with connectivity!!! Like 50% of the time! Like i could be on WiFi or my LTE and it will tell me I have no internet connection. Which makes no sense because I’m using my phone just fine with any other app that requires internet. So then i have to use safari instead and that works fine. But then what’s the point of the app? Anyway, please address this issue! Thank you 
I have always used this app and never had issues. For a couple of weeks now, anytime I look at my cart, it says it’s empty and isn’t syncing to my account online. Also, if I go to my orders, it says “OOPS SOMETHING WENT WRONG” and won’t show me any info about them. I also am unable to make any purchases (via 1 click or otherwise).  Fix the app. Seriously. 
Just in time for  the holiday season, I have been unable to use the app to checkout for the past month or so. I can add items to my cart, but checkout no longer recognizes my Touch ID and won’t ask for my password, just shuts down. I then have to log in on the website and checkout from there. No update in sight!  Big inconvenience.
I can’t see my previous orders or check out and it’s infuriating. I’ve been battling to check out for 5 mins. I can’t even login on safari since it sends me straight to the app. I’m giving up and just deleting the app altogether.
I love the app. My only issue is that the past month or so I haven’t been able to look at my orders. It has me scan my fingerprint then says “something went wrong” I don’t know how to resolve this issue. Every time a new update comes out I hope it gets fixed but never does.
Whether I’m on WIFI or LTE/4G, when I open the amazon app I get an error that says “can’t connect to internet.” I’ve deleted the app and reinstalled, closed and reopened, signed in and out, and everything else I can think of. Even checked the app settings.
The app keeps saying the connect to the internet and/or that the Amazon network isn’t working but if I try on my computer or through safari on my phone Amazon works. I don’t know what’s wrong with the app on the iPhone 8 but it doesn’t work. This is completely bull sh*t.
Why do I need to be notified every time someone I know downloads this garbage app??? That’s not s message that’s Facebooks terrible self promotion of their useless app that could have just remained a part of their other useless app. Seriously stop making up reasons for me to open this garbage. Maybe if you were a credible source of actual notifications everyone wouldn’t hate you so much...
When signing on (iPhone 6 and iPhone X) a message pops up the says “ Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.” I’ve tried updating the Amazon app, iOS, uninstalling and reinstalling.
For a couple of months now I have been unable to access my orders on the app. I click on “orders” and get a “sorry something went wrong” error. Now, as of today (at least I discovered it today), I cannot log in to place an order. I put items in my cart while I was on my computer, then later went to buy them on the app. When it checks my face id to log me in my face is recognized but I get the same error message.  I’m not sure if this is an iphone x specific issue but it’s pretty annoying. 
Usually I would rate this app a 4 or a 5. But for the past two weeks when I attempt to see my recent orders...a window pops up and states there is an error.  I’ll click “OK” and it still won’t load. Hoping this will be fixed soon.
For the past 3 weeks I have been having problems with this app. Just about every time I try to get on the app it tells me “uh-oh something went wrong with amazon go back to amazon Home” and I’ll click the amazon home button and it says “uh-oh something went wrong with the amazon app” and it won’t work. So I get off clear it out and try again and it says the same thing. I’m so sick of it. I order a lot of stuff off of here and I can’t now. I haven’t been able to in a while and when it does decide to let me look I add stuff to my cart and get off because I have something else to do and I try to go back and get on it later and I can’t. THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED ASAP. Thanks
It prompted me to start using Face ID to access my orders, check out, settings, etc. it doesn’t work though. It always shows and error and since I can’t access settings I can’t turn it off. Really frustrating cause I constantly use this app for things I can’t go buy because of my work and school schedule. Seriously considering cancelling my Prime account because the app is no longer convenient and only causes problems.
I can’t log into my account. I’ve called customer support several times and all they do is reset my password when I tell them that it’s been done before and I don’t want it. Please fix this issue. Not sure if it’s an app issue or website.
Please fix this annoying bug. I can't order anything or check out certain account details without it asking for my password, then a pop up window saying something's wrong try again, then going back to square one! I haven't ordered stuff I need in months and forgot about a Christmas present I wanted to buy because of this. This is pretty ridiculous.
Ever since updating to iOS 11, the app is giving me fits. No matter what you do 1 click checkout doesn’t work. And then when you click the proceed to checkout button while in your cart it takes you to someplace else in the app. Sometimes if you finally do purchase something it doesn’t confirm the purchase. More often than not I have to go to my desktop computer in order to use Amazon. I use an iPhone 6, and an iPad pro with iOS 11.2
Can't log in. Haven't been able to for quite some time. The regular website works fine. I get a message saying "error oops something wrong"
Just keeps saying error or no internet connection. I’ve tried deleting and redone loaded and it still doesn’t work.
I thought the app for the iPhone was kind of terrible, but then I started using the app on the iPad and it’s the absolute WORST. I decided to go with Amazon for my baby registry because everyone shops on Amazon anyway, but boy was I mislead. First of all, navigating to my registry is a total pain in the a**. I shouldn’t have to click on a million different things to get to my registry, there should be one button conveniently located as soon as I open the app. Once I’m on my registry (on my iPad) I can’t even edit it because the formatting is all messed up... I’m forced to try again on my iPhone, or if that’s not working I have to go sit at my desktop, which seems really archaic for a company that’s basically ruling the world. People have told me that it’s been very difficult for them to even find where to search for my registry...this shouldn’t be happening! This all made me set up another registry where it lets me directly link to my Amazon registry. What a total unnecessary pain. C’mon Amazon, get with it. Remember when you only sold text books to college students? Those were the days...maybe you should go back to your roots.
After I changed the Amazon password from the browser, this app stopped working. If I place an order, or even try to log off (to log on again with new password) it gives an error message.
Screen once in a while glitches while clicking on a product , and continually flashes until you leave that screen. I don’t know if It has anything to do with Face ID but I’m guessing that may be the cause . Needs to be updated , stick with amazon.com for now
Login on the app has been broken for f***ing months. Fingerprint ain’t work. Typing pw errors you out. Get your sh*t together heifers.
Need to fix the authentication so we can actually order items and view history. This used to work but will not work now. It really limits what we need this app for. Always the “something went wrong error”
I used to use the app ALL the time to buy things but they updated it a little while ago and now I can’t even buy things it always says there’s an error. It also makes me log-in if I do anything on the app at l all which is really annoying and never did this before...can you please fix it and go back to the way it was?
My app doesn’t work most of the time. Then I will try to go to the Amazon website through safari and it takes me back to the app. Super annoying. 🙁
It used to be great but for months now it keeps making me put in my password every 10 seconds over and over and won’t let me process an order. Please update it so it works!
I have loved shopping on Amazon since I was in college when I still had a student discount. Up till recently I have not encountered a problem with the app on my phone or even on my iPad, but since a couple updates ago I am having trouble logging in to my account. I have to login from my computer to actually be able to see past orders or even to make a purchase. The app on my iPad and on my iPhone says something along the lines of“sorry an error has occurred” whenever I try to login
Lately I am unable to order anything via my app. It keeps telling me something went wrong. It’s incredibly frustrating to have to log onto my laptop or desktop to buy simple items when I could have done it in under 5 minutes on my phone. Please fix!
I love shopping on amazon but everytime I open my app now and for the past month or two, it says for me to please check my internet(something about CS1) and it will not let me sign in or do anything. I have deleted the app and re-downloaded it 4 times, but it still will not work at ALL
it’s hard to use and browse on the app because it keeps freezing, no way to see the products details when I clicked on the thumbnail. Had to use the desktop instead.
Like other reviewers I have been unable to make purchases from my app. I could add items to my cart, but when it was time to check out it would require me to input my password. And after submitting my password, I would receive a “something went wrong” error message. This has occurred over the past several months.  So today I deleted and reinstalled the app, and was able to conduct business as usual. No problems whatsoever.   This is a great app, but it can be frustrating if the above occurs. Therefore, delete and reinstall, and all will be better. 
The app keep getting error msg
App won’t work without WiFi connection.
Love the app update but difficult to get to sellers account from the app. Please rectify!
I don’t mind notifications about my orders. I hate the mindless non-stop “deals” I receive even though I disabled any option related to it. Best thing is to disable the notifications for the app and just rely on email notifications for order status.
What's up with the ads on the home page? I get it if stores are promoting their Amazon sold products but do we need Geico ads and ads to buy tickets to movies now? Get these off of here.
I keep having issues with the Amazon iPhone app. It keeps telling me to check my internet connection and try again (CS1) and the pop up is Network Error: The Amazon.com mobile service encountered a problem. Please try again shortly.  I even undeleted and reinstalled, nothing works. This has been ongoing for several months now.  Please fix this issue! 
The app sometimes squeezes the buttons at the top on iPhone X, making it impossible to click the back button.
Just like on the iPhone it needs a customer pic gallery for the app.
Necesito saber si tienen la opción de desconectar todas la conexiones, ya qué hay una persona que está conectada con mi usuario y aún ella ha utilizado mi cuenta y ya no quiero que lo siga haciendo, yo cambie la clave de mi cuenta pero ella aún sigue conectada y lo utiliza
I hold Amazon to a very hire standard, and their mobile app disappoints. I once had an authentication issue that would not resolve itself, and amazons support suggested that I uninstall the app and reinstall. This is not a solution.  Most recently every time I log in it says “something went wrong”, but then if I click something else I am actually logged in. It shouldn’t be this tricky. 
As much as I love Amazon, it doesn’t help that I’m now unable to add to my wish list especially during the holiday season!  Please fix it.
Please fix the purchase and sellers function. I can’t do anything if. It’s on this app anymore.
Crashes at checkout. I was told it was because I was using an older phone and now I have a iPhone 10 and it still kicks me out at check out. I have to go to my pc to check out. What pain
I live on this app. Prime customer. Amazon rewards card holder. I can’t place an order! Anytime I add items to my shopping cart, click proceed to check out, and then click place order, my order does not go through. It’s simply re-loads the shopping cart page. Please fix this serious error as soon as possible
There needs to be a fix for the high background activity.  According to my battery, I’ve used the app for 2 mins but had 15 mins background activity.  Even when I turn it off it still registers, so something is hanging when I suspend the app.  Please fix, I will be uninstalling until a fix is issued. 
Amazon please fix the app. I can't place an order. My cart continues to 'go empty'. Constant error messages. I can't believe this app has gone to the dogs. Please fix/update. Your killing me!
I love this app...but I have deleted and downloaded this app over and over again. There is a notification badge that I can’t get to go away. I have checked everything. I can thing of, to no avail. Please, can you fix this or tell me how to?! Thanks!
It’s getting really annoying. Without this being fix the app is basically useless. I can’t add items to my lists, can’t check my order status etc. whenever I try to verify with fingerprints, which should not be the only option in the first place, it says something is wrong. SO FIX THIS.
It is harder to browse Amazon using the app than it is in Safari. Not that it matters though, since the authentication mechanism is broken and neither entering your password nor using touchID lets you make a purchase. Lame.
I don’t know what you did but I’m not the only one having an issue. I put my password in and it just seats there. I go back to the Home page and then try to check my order status. It works for about 30 seconds then kicks me out. Please fix it.
If I try to order on the app, or access my pending orders, or look at wish lists, the app asks me to sign in again, then comes back with an error message. I have to go to my computer to accomplish anything with Amazon. Especially frustrating at the holiday season. Hope there is a fix coming like yesterday!  Also: defaults to ‘show password’? Not good. 
I can’t purchase anything in the app since the last update. Won’t recommend until they fix
This app is garbage you’d think one of the largest business in the world would have a functioning app.
Constant errors trying to log-in to view account details.
That’s the message that pops up on this app after the recent updates. I can’t check the status of any orders or order new things now. Makes it kind of a useless app.
My review would be higher if the app worked. It's a 50-50 as to whether or not it gives me a CS1 error even though I have internet connection.
I’ve used this app for quite awhile but in the last few weeks I can’t make any purchases. I get an error when I do Touch ID or even when I input my password. Amazon made me change my long time password and ever since then the app hasn’t worked to make purchases 90% of the time. Every once in awhile it doesn’t make me do a password so then I can purchase. Please fix this bug.   2 weeks later and this is still a problem, just in time for Christmas shopping. I have not bought nearly as much from Amazon because of this issue. I wonder how many other people have given up. 
Having the same problem as Horselovermom. Having the app is pointless if I have to log in through desktop just to purchase. The update didn't help either.
I’ve had this app for several months and it has always had glitches, but now more so than ever. I’m using iPhone 7 and the latest  app update but can’t use it to complete a purchase because it locks in a circular linking loop. Some of the features like past orders consistently return an error message. Amazon should have a much better app development team than would produce something like this.
App keeps kicking me back to my cart when trying to purchase. Says “sorry something went wrong” each time I try to purchase and asks for my password. Please fix!
IT WONT LET ME DO ANYTHING!!! All it says is “something went wrong try again” 😡😡😡😡👎👎
can’t look at any previous orders because it prompts me to sign in (even tho i’m ALREADY signed in) and then when i do it says, “oops! something went wrong. Try again.” and then I do try again and its just the same thing over and over. can’t even use the app at all anymore
My Amazon app keeps saying "sorry something went wrong. Where working on fixing it. CS3 I've tried everything and it won't work.
I have been using amazon services for years. The app must have been recently updated, because it is acting very buggy. It keeps shutting down, I can’t make my purchases from it anymore (now I need to go to my desktop computer to place an order).  The app used to work great. I just deleted it. I’m going to try downloading it again to see if that solves anything.
Repeatedly prompts me to log in and then says “something went wrong.” I’ve updated, restarted, all of that. I still have to go to my computer to make a purchase. Not very convenient.
I have the exact same problem as horselovermom. Please get this fixed- I am just about ready to trash my Amazon account!!!!
Since the last update I am unable to purchase from the app or see past orders, or go to account info.  I get an error and it crashes. Never had a problem before the last update. Hoping the devs see this and fix it soon.
The app does not allow me to sign in with my password or Touch ID. I’ve tried reinstalling and it still doesn’t work. I don’t have this problem with any other app on my iPhone.
I am an amazon prime holder loved the site until this past huge order I did for Christmas they charged me five different times now my account is froze won’t get my things for Christmas cause of their error so now I’m left to struggle and all I got is I’m sorry 😂🖕 please explain this to my four year old son and me as a single mother thanks amazon for nothing called three times just to get a not my problem story !
Amazon app for iPhone. Sometime in fall 2017 this app was RUINED. I can no longer place new orders or view existing ones!
My app was working perfectly three days ago and now I get “no internet connection “!  Please help me I don’t see any support for my iOS device on this matter.
I usually shop through this app but hate having to go my internet browser to check out using Amazon Smile. I wish the app would “Smile”!
I love amazon but now that I have the iPhone X I cannot use the app. When I go to check out I can’t because it wants facial recognition. So now I have to go through the internet. Please update for x users. Thanks!
On my iPhone I hit check out it takes me to type password then back to cart over and over. I guess y’all don’t want my money?
The app is extremely unstable now, won’t load pages and now I can’t even login, getting the message “Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.”
Used to work no problem. Now I get “oops something went wrong” every time I try to check out. Dumb.
Trying to order gifts for my out of state family and the site keeps telling me that there is an error and to try again later!!! Worst time of year for this glitch!
It’s quite a shame how big amazon is and still how buggy the app is. There’s nothing wrong with the UI, it looks great, but boy is it buggy. It’ll throw you into these loops between adding an item to a list, password or anywhere along the check-out process. I never really have success with the app. It’s practically useless except to browse item, then send yourself the link to the computer to order there.
First, I love amazon! Second, I hate the app. Every time I check “orders” it makes me log in, so I do. Then it says something went wrong and won’t let me check orders. I have to use my husband’s phone to do it. I want to be able to stay logged in and check my orders. Please help.
**Update**  A month later and the Touch ID error isn't fixed. Signing in via Safari makes the entire app completely pointless. Also, don't advertise free one day shipping if you can't do it. Going to family Christmas tomorrow w/o presents for a few people when they should have arrived today.   Original Review 11/18/17:  Used to be a great app and most of the functionality is there, but anything involving Touch ID is a no-go. I can't make a purchase or check order history. Kind of pointless to use the app at all if I have to go to Amazon thru a browser to complete a transaction or check an order. 
Haven’t been able to use the app in months. Keep getting a “CS1” error. Called amazon and they basically told me there’s nothing they can do. I’ve deleted and reinstalled the app multiple times. I have an iPhone 7, there shouldn’t be any issues.
New update - now every time I try to purchase items the app seems to short circuit, reading out different errors, but always closing the checkout window. Whoops?
This app used function seamlessly. Now my touch ID is gone (even though it is enabled in my settings) and every time I want to look at “my orders” it says I have to sign in and then when I sign in it says “something went wrong try again.“ When I open up the app it says I’m already signed in. Very frustrating.
Rather I’m on WiFi or on my data it ALWAYS says it can’t load 🙄 I have an iPhone 7+ so I know it’s not me 🙄 fix yalls app!!! 🙄
Why does it constantly say “something went wrong” and not load the order details even when I put in the correct password?
Im In the US. And no matter what i do, the app thinks i wanna buy on international. Please fix.
Constant errors with logging in normally or logging in via TouchID. NEVER DOES CONNECT making the app worthless!!!
I can browse kind of easily, not the best, but can only log into my account half the time and haven’t been able to check out in months, always have to go to a web browser :(
Love Amazon, love Prime, and even generally love the app. But for months now, I haven’t been able to successfully open the “Your Orders” tab. Whenever I click the button, it obviously asks for my thumb-print to log in and verify it’s me, but then it always pops up with a little dialogue box that says, “Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.”  I’ve tried again. I’ve quit the app. I’ve made sure my iOS and the app itself are updated to the most recent versions. I’ve restarted my phone. Nothing changes this.  Please fix this feature as it’s a main feature I use the app for! Without being able to check the status of my orders, the app doesn’t even serve half its function, in my opinion. 
It asks for my password- doesn’t recognize it and says something went wrong... I go through the steps and place order and it takes me back to my full cart.   I have to complete my order on my desktop.    I am shopping elsewhere more this holiday season....I’d fix ASAP
This app has some major issues. I can’t look at my past orders - it asks for my password every time and then when I put it in (correctly) it says there was an error. I’m also not able to order anything from the app. As a frequent shopper from the app this is super frustrating and annoying.
It doesn’t recognize my password on the app so I can’t actually buy anything. I can add to my cart but I have to log in on my computer to actually buy something. Super frustrating. Otherwise I like the app. It shows different search results than the computer though. That’s kind of annoying too. I can’t just search for something on my computer and get the same results to find what I might have seen before.
Ever since the new update, I can’t order, login to my account, or check the status of orders that I made on the desktop, through the app. The big need to be addressed.
I can’t even place an order on my iPhone. It keeps saying there was an error but let’s me in to my account. It asks over and over what shipping address to send to. No matter how many times I re-select my address, it flashes back to the question. I even did the latest update and it still does this. Fix please
Latest update not allowing me to order, error with fingerprint login.
Ever since I updated my Amazon app with your most recent update, the app says “something went wrong. Please try again later.”  It doesn’t do this on my iPad or desktop.  Please help!
I love amazon, I have amazon prime and would never give it up! But since they enabled “customers who have bought _____ also bought ____” when I’m scrolling through my cart, is enough to make me delete the app on my phone and stick to shopping on my computer.
App is slow. Need to have more control of settings/ preferences within the app. I can't archive my orders in the app because it looks the same as the mobile website. So this means I have to go on desktop version in order to do all of this! What's the purpose of the app.
Amazon is doing a great thing by offering the Amazon Smile program. But the whole thing feels half-baked if they aren’t going to extend this functionality into the app. They’ve had plenty of time to address this. Looking forward to future updates.
This version of the app breaks the login functionality! Amazon- get it together! It's the holidays!
App will not let me update quantities or place order.  Terrible.
Can you hurry up and put Walmart out of business please?
I don’t know what has changed on the iPhone version, but the app is always asking me to reenter my password, especially when I want to look at orders. Today, I couldn’t get it to show me all my order details. I would enter my password and it would tell me there was a problem, would show me nothing. This problem doesn’t occur on the iPad.  Please fix this…  STILL BROKEN!!!! 
Every time I attempt to log into my account I get a notification that says, “Sorry an error has occurred. Please try again later.” Yet it still logs me in. Which would be fine, but then when I try to make a purchase it gives me the same message. I’m able to make purchases on a desktop, but I prefer mobile... fix this asap!!
This app was working great until the latest update, now it keeps freezing up and I keep getting we are having difficulties. PLEASE FIX!!!
Worthless app since hitting the checkout button does nothing.
States no internet connection so I made sure it can connect to cellular data, but it still isn’t working. I’ve deleted and reinstalled app. All other apps and internet work
Every time I try to do something on the app, it asks for my password.  Upon entering, it always says "Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again."  I can use the desktop site with no issues, but the app is not working right. This app used to work flawlessly.  Please fix
I have to sign in anytime I hit checkout and after I enter my password I get a pop-up that says "something went wrong."  It's been happening for weeks and so I keep heading to my desktop to purchase! Please fix!!
The current version is useless as I can’t log in at all—not manually nor with Touch ID. Every time I try I get the message “sorry, something went wrong.”
Clicking on “Place Your Order” button just takes me back to my cart. Very frustrating! Must wait to get to a computer to complete my purchase.
I don’t understand what is going on, but when using the amazon app on my iPad and I tried it on my aunts as well...you are not able to get your account information and access many important features that you can through the app on your phone (mine is an iPhone 6 Plus) or through the internet. So, something is not working properly with the iPad app version and needs to be looked into.
I love this app. But here’s the thing. I can’t sign in with my thumb print or password when I’m trying to view my orders or proceed to checkout. Please fix this because I hate going from my phone to computer just to click a button, when I should be able to do everything from my phone.
I love Amazon caz you can get lots of interesting things up to Alaska, I build motorbikes and motorcycles and Amazon has almost everything I would need to make it nice :)
It’s been like this for about two weeks now every time I log in to see my past orders it says ‘something went wrong, please try again’ and now it won’t let me buy anything. When I go to proceed with purchase it takes me to the shopping details( which is already saved) and when I click it, it takes me back to the proceed with check out over and over again.
I have been having load issues the past week and error messages today. Plz fix this issue.
Get the message “please check your internet connection and try again (CS1)” when attempting to use over cellular data. I am on Xfinity Mobile and they say it isn’t them. Works fine on WiFi
There’s an error on the app that makes it impossible to use. ‘Please check your internet connection and try again(CS1).’ Most if not all other apps work, why not this one even after being updated to the most current firmware and re-downloading the app numerous times. I am forced to use the browser on my phone instead to log into my account.
Every time I go to check out it asks me for my password to continue like always but once I input my password it gives me a error message of “something went wrong” and I’ll have to put my password again then it does the same thing all over again. I love the app but I have been having to checkout from the browser. Please fix the issue
App won't stop glitching. Won't let me put in my password, and keeps saying there was an error. If I do it on the actual website, my password works with no errors.
This app keeps resetting the language setting I configure. It's so annoying. Additionally, the app thinks it needs to translate what I searched for into the exact same thing. When will this be fixed?! 
Amazon app is not working for a few days, and also in browser its not working in my mobile phone. And it worked ok! On my laptop is ok, but on the iphone, no amazon!!! Fixx?!? 
App keeps freezing and crashing on iPhone 8 and repeatedly asking for password then freezing! What’s the problem Amazon?!
This app has become and unmanageable abomination. I can’t login using Touch ID, and when I go to the menu it says “oops, something went wrong.” Every. Single. Time. Fix it please.
it’s been month and this app just doesn’t work well. amazon fresh is a complete disaster, making adjustments on my account is impossible from my phone, family sharing is another story...i can keep going🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️overall it’s just getting old..
Constantly have to sign in only to get the error message “sorry, something went wrong”. Can’t make purchases through the app now.  Website is still going strong, app needs a ton of work.
I have no problems with the app other than you cannot place an order from it! It also errors out and says I’m not signed in when I am. Please fix this so I don’t need to use a computer to place an order each time!
This app crashes all the time with my iphone 8. I cannot buy anything at all. Better to use website than this app. Not good amazon not good.
Haven’t been able to place an order on the app since then... get it together please.
Why can’t I scan a barcode from the iPad version of the app? That’s just stupid. I’m trying to buy something and you’re making extra work for me.
I can no longer complete a transaction through the app.
My app is up to date but every time I try to checkout I am prompted to log in. So I sign in, go to checkout, and have to log in again. So annoying! It’s been over a month and counting. Have to make purchases from my internet browser for the foreseeable future.
After the latest series of iOS updates, this app doesn't load, won't let you sign in. I tried deleting the app and downloading again, it did not solve any problems. There are major problems with iOS and the Amazon App.
Literally cannot use this app on my phone, no matter how many times I re-download it eventually gets a “cs1 error” and becomes bricked.
Amazon can you please fix this?!?  I keep getting a “sorry something went wrong” message when trying to complete my purchase.  Wish I could buy things.
I’m still unable to purchase anything from this app. Who knew that Amazon could be this stupid. DELETED (after I post this).
Ever since the new iOS I can “sign in”. What I mean by that is it shows my photo at the top when I’m browsing but if I was to go purchase something is makes me put my password or fingerprint, then gives me “oops something went wrong”. So annoying. Let me know when it’s fixed, until then I’ll be using the website on safari I suppose.

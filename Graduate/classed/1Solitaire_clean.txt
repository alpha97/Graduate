Excellent collection of card games. All my favorites. Many options to customize games how you like. Can't believe it's free and ad free.

Good games it makes a grest differance to be without ads ...can you please tell me how to change the deck into the spanish deck
New Review: Awesome! It can now be moved to the SD card (went from 23+ MB to 7+ MB) Thank you Tobias! Old Review: Only issue I'm having with it is... I can not move it to the SD card (which would be nice to be able to do, considering it's install size). I have a Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime running android version 5.0.2
Nice collection of games. A must for when you need to kill time.
No Vegas. No good. Reply to Dev: learn the rules of Vegas. What you call Vegas is NOT Vegas! Tapping a card once should move it, as well. To be fair, you're offering a lot, but all I care about is Vegas. Buy in is $52, payout is $5/card, no recycle of deck, etc. Look it up for more.

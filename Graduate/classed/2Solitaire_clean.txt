Add free but win free also it becomes so easily predictable a short way through a game that there is no chance of winning (in klondike at least ) that you can start a new game but it is so boring I cannot belive the so called random deal of the cards three of some follow by two of another or all low cards in one game and high in another I'm not stupid I've played klondike or patience for years with real cards and never played 12 games without a win ! Uninstalled
Game is good but some time crash on landscape mode.
Freecell is terrible, can't see the numbers and figures. Unable to play on landscape. I changed the fonts to large in Android, accessibility setting. Don't know if this could cause a problem.
This is a really great solitaire implementation and thank you very much for offering it free without ads. I only wished the 'AI' would be less stupid. It always seems to take the worst option when double tapping cards as a shortcut :-)
Awesome! Best free solitaire game on the play store
Play it all the time, only thing I extra I'd like is the option to turn off some games so they don't show up, but other than that, it's perfect.

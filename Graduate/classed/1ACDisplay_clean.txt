Waving your hand across the screen does not open the app. I have tried it several times on my Galaxy Note 5 with no luck. That's one option that I had loved about the Moto X was their active screen. You could just wave your hand across the screen and the time, date and any messages would appear on the screen. I thought that that is was this app was suppose to do, but I can't seem to get it to work.
Awesome lockscreen I usually dont like "defacing" the stock look of my G4, but i made and exception for this app. I hope the devs read this, because i have a few requests. The app sometimes puts my phone to sleep for no reason. The wave to wake option is sweet, but only works 1/10 times and my hand needs to be really close to the sensor. Other than that, the notifications on the lockscreen are baller, and the active mode is pretty cool as well and works most of the time.
No updates! This app definitely has potential! but there's no consistent development. I really enjoy this app for the most part, but you can tell there are bugs that need to be addressed. Why not update your app and turn it into a real money maker! I would pay if this app was keep updated.. Just so you know, thanks
Amazing, Absolutely Awesome, Love it This app is absolutely, mind-blowingly and bogglingly, beautifully, totally and amazingly completely AWESOME!!! I have been looking for a lockscreen for so long that I almost gave up, but then along came AcDisplay. There is absolutely not one thing I would change in this app, that's how beautiful it is. No mistakes, nothing, none, nada, zilch. *App you're amazing, just the way you are* Hats off to the devs, great work, keep it up!!!ðŸ’“ðŸ’—ðŸ’“ðŸ’—ðŸ’“ðŸ’—
Perfect! Perfect!! Perfect!!! Nearly rooted my android and then I found this. Perfect in every way. Does everything I wanted for a lockscreen. Loving the minimalistic design too. Pure winner. I'm only nitpicking here when I say my only problem is with the tiny time notice at the top when you click on a notification. I wish there was a setting to turn that off. It's still the best piece of app I have encountered in a long while.
Almost! Great minimalist lock screen. The wave proximity sensor unlocking function should be improved though. As well as adding more options for swiping from upper/lower right/left, not just dialer and camera. And it would also be perfect if you can edit the size of the clock. Hihi. Still an awesome app though! :)

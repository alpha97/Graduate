Once you go through downloading a dozen versions of whatever movie you're looking, and you find one that's in the right language and will actually play then it's pretty cool, a lot of hassle to get to that point though
I love frostwire and the selection that it had mp4 for the best part and sometime mp3 and as long as you don't get the home made movies.
Super easy to use. I love how it works. You can play the songs you have downloaded even offline.
Too many covers and there's a lot of music I can't find.
A good app to get free songs on your phone.
Its amazing you can listen to music with no WIFI
First music downloader on any new device.. I love it...
Great for music on my phone for work!!
Not doing any of its primary functions. Songs you've downloaded disappear from your music player, search results are usually low and limited. you'll find more flac and mp4 files (which won't play on my phone) then mp3 files. I'm pretty sure this will slow down your phone. Also , most irritatingly, THINGS JUST AREN'T DOWNLOADING! This app is pointless now
Love it! A surprisingly thorough music app, & I am a music snob of sorts. Minimal ads, & extensive knowledge of the obscure music unavailable elsewhere. Worth the download.
This is the best music app ever! I have been looking everywhere to find an app where I can download and play music offline! Definently recommend! Edit: I recently got a new phone and had to download some songs again but the songs I was looking for were gone! Please add Sabrina Carpenters album EVOLution and I will rate 5 stars.

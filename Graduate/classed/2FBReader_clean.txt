There's an annoying bug that after switching apps and back, the last read page disappears, and even when turning pages it's skipped, so need to force close the app to fix this. Otherwise good app and will give 5 stars when this is fixed.
I think this is an amazing app, very simple to use. The only issue I find us the dictionary. I couldn't link my other app dictionary data to this. Developers has got this challenge.
I hated this app, because I couldn't find any books I was looking for, such as Jacqueline Wilson and Jeff Kinney. All I could find were adult books. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this app to children.
Meizu Pro 5. Not adequate behavior when reading in PDF format. If close and open program didn't start from place where I broke my reading, it starts from help. Have to browse my files, pick up file again and find place, where I broke reading, manually. Please fix because good reading app.
Sufficiently proven but not that generous in format and systems. Could be more advanced to stop keeping the user obliviously knocked into the installation. If the crew of the app could remove supportive adds it could mark detailed words in detective editors.
Fantastic app with all options I need. The only problem is with adding a dictionary. I have great dictionary and cannot use it wit FB, I hope the developers can fix this last missing bit on the way to the top reader ever.
About as close to perfect as an app can get. Fully functional, beautiful, smooth, nothing useless or irritating or thoughtless.

Shittiest application ..doesn't even match up to expectations even with an upgrade ..lags a lot and often restarts uselessly ...less modication tools on a free domain..app developers should honestly learn how to upgrade and make best out of limited resources.
A completely dysfunctional app that lacks direction or help files.
It's a good all to easily update or create idea in post or page. Managing is a bit tricky so I firstly use it as app for the blog. I got a bug when modify the "heading" of sentence, the size become different, even for same heading, base on where you click, what was the size before, .. I need to load the page again to fix size
The app is great... But is sorely lacking in certain aspects, the most important one being that it has no private chat option. I run a blog with multiple contributers and communications regarding posts and other stuff are a real pain as they need to be organised off WordPress. So at least put in a chat option between site contributers if a built in chat option is too much to ask for.
This app is perfect but please I need to be able to search for posts; scrolling is not all that easy. Thanks
Doesn't have a "sign out" function. To achieve that, you'll need to uninstall and reinstall. Just an update on 4/28/18: Still requires uninstall and reinstall. Great stuff.
Its I think a good application for first time user to make website.
Keren bgt lah, cukup membantu buat yg suka nulis tp malas buka laptop..
Hi dev, can you add justify button on app?

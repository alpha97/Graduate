Crappy I had to delete every song sead it had an area playing
Great way to download movies easy to use and many options and choices to make
Cant preview a song before downloading so it's a guessing game
Good apps to look for favorite songs with the real singer... easily to download but to be careful for the unknown artist coz it might not be the original singer... that's the pros but cons is choose the right one coz there a lot of unknown artist who is doing copycat..
To me, it does everything it says it does and then some it looks beyond allows you to look Beyond just the song it does other suggestion for you to be able to Surf thru or other songs you didn't know that artist had. watch out how much data is being downloaded overall. Far OUT Man!
The only thing I would want added is an advanced search so you can look up by genre. Other than that great app.
Ok, so multiply the five stars by ten, you get 50 stars! I Have this app on all three of my phones! Its so great to use when editing YouTube videos, for example; Speedpaints(which i do alot of) it's so easy! And you can listen offline, as long as you have a song downloaded online

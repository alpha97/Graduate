# strin = "it's a very good game, i must say, 5/5 but i have a few wishes. i would have bought the computer version if it hat no sweat mode like the ios version. a second complaint is cave mobs. depth worms can one hit kill you, making a deathloop if you dropped valuable items on death. something else that should be fixed is the bunnymen. they attack you if you have any meat, but they aren't content with slaughtering you once, no, i've died at least 9 times to the same posse of 4 bunnies, even after i dropped the meat! you should really. fix this, if you please. the only option is to put them to sleep. attacking them triggers the entire village, pan flutes take too long, so the only way is to eat a mandrake, a non-renewable resource! all in all, fix the cave mobs and i'll give it a 5 star. make no sweat mode for computer, and i'll happily buy it.  -shraamper  edit: the mandrakes didn't work; they still slaughtered me. 2 stars it is, then. i also tried to overwhelm them with 5 pigs, but i still got wrecked! i guess i'll have to give up on the caves!!.not to mention they are all trapped down there. i also tried distracting them with tantacles( i'm wickerbottom) but it still failed. one of my caves are swarmed with depth worms, and the other is swarmed with bunny warlords. so now i'm stuck on the surface with most of my workforce of pigs sealed away. if i try to get my pigs out, they will see my meat and it will all start over again! finally the mandrake thing worked! dang that took awhile!"
